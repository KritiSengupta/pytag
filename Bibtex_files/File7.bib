abstract = {Many of the mechanisms used by active insects to maintain water balance are not available to dormant individuals. Physiological and biochemical mechanisms of dehydration tolerance and resistance in dormant insects and some other invertebrates are reviewed, as well as linkages of dehydration with energy use and metabolism, with cold hardiness, and with diapause. Many dormant insects combine several striking adaptations to maintain water balance that-in addition to habitat choice-may include especially reduction of body water content, decreased cuticular permeability, absorption of water vapour, and tolerance of low body water levels. Many such features require energy and hence that metabolism, albeit much reduced, continues during dormancy. Four types of progressively dehydrated states are recognized: water is managed internally by solute or ion transport; relatively high concentrations of solutes modify the behaviour of water in solutions; still higher concentrations of certain carbohydrates lead to plasticized rubbers or glasses with very slow molecular kinetics; and anhydrobiosis eliminates metabolism.

abstract = {Olfactory systems combine an extraordinary molecular sensitivity with robust synaptic plasticity. Central neuronal circuits that perform pattern recognition in olfaction typically discriminate between hundreds of molecular species and form associations between odor onsets and behavioral contingencies that can last a lifetime. Two design features in the olfactory system of the terrestrial mollusk Limax maximus may be common elements of olfactory systems that display the twin features of broad molecular sensitivity and rapid odor learning: spatially coherent oscillations in the second-order circuitry that receives sensory input; and involvement of the interneuronal messengers nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) in sensory responses and circuit dynamics of the oscillating olfactory network. The principal odor processing center in Limax, the procerebrum (PC) of the cerebral ganglion, contains on the order of 105 local interneurons and receives both direct and processed input from olfactory receptors. Field potential recordings in the PC show an oscillation at approximately 0.7 Hz that is altered by odor input. Optical recordings of voltage changes in local regions of the PC show waves of depolarization that originate at the distal pole and propagate to the base of the PC. Weak odor stimulation transiently switches PC activity from a propagating mode to a spatially uniform mode. The field potential oscillation in the PC lobe depends on intercellular communication via NO, based on opposing effects of reagents that decrease or increase NO levels in the PC. Inhibition of NO synthase slows the field potential oscillation, while application of exogenous NO increases the oscillation frequency. A role for CO in PC dynamics is suggested by experiments in which CO liberation increases the PC oscillation frequency. These design features of the Limax PC lobe odor processing circuitry may relate to synaptic plasticity that subserves both connection of new receptors throughout the life of the slug and its highly developed odor learning ability.},

abstract = {The current problems with decreasing fossile resources and increasing environmental pollution by petrochemical-based plastics have stimulated investigations to find biosynthetic materials which are also biodegradable. Bacterial reserve materials such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) have been discovered to possess thermoplastic properties and can be synthesized from renewable resources. Poly-$\beta$-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) is at present the most promising PHA; and BIOPOL, its copolymer with poly-$\beta$-hydroxy-valerate (PHV), is already industrially produced (ICI, UK), and used as packaging material (WELLA, FRG). According to the literature, PHA degradation has so far mainly been observed in bacteria; only under certain environmental conditions has fungal degradation of PHAs been indicated. Since fungi constitute an important part of microbial populations participating in degradation processes, a simple screening method for fungal degradation of BIOPOL, a PHA-based plastic, was developed. Several media with about 150 fungal strains from different terrestrial environments and belonging to different systematic and ecological groups were used. PHA depolymerization was tested on three PHB-based media, each with 0.1% BIOPOL or PHB homopolymer causing turbidity of the medium. The media contained either a comparatively low or high content of organic carbon (beside PHA) or were based on mineral medium with PHA as the principal source of carbon. The degradation activity was detectable due to formation of a clear halo around the colony (Petri plates) or a clear zone under the colony (test tubes). All fungal strains tested were able to grow on all three media. Growth, activity and clarity of PHA-degradation, however, differed depending on the medium used. For screening of BIOPOL degradation the mineral medium with 0.1% BIOPAL, 0.01% yeast extract and 0.01% peptone proved most satisfactory and showed about 55% of the fungal strains to be active, regardless of systematic and ecological groups. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {The immunostaining pattern for the peptide gastrin/cholecystokinin 8 (gastrin/CCK8) in the molluscan central nervous system has been considered. The changes in the distribution of gastrin/CCK8 immunoreactivity were analyzed in the neurons of different areas of the cerebral ganglia (mesocerebrum and metacerebrum) and in the buccal ganglia of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa, during rest and active phases. During the period of inactivity and after one day of activity, there were several immunoreactive neurons in the mesocerebrum and metacerebrum of the snails and in the buccal ganglia, whereas after 7 days of activity the number of labeled neurons decreased. Data suggested a storage of gastrin/CCK8 in the neurons when behavioral activities in which the peptide is involved (such as feeding-related behavior) are suppressed or reduced. The different percentage of gastrin/CCK8 immunoreactive neurons in the left and right mesocerebrum provides information about the activities controlled by these neurons, which could be related to the adaptive evolution and plasticity of the brain in terrestrial pulmonates.

abstract = {Osteoclasts mediate acid dissolution of bone for maintenance of serum [Ca2+] and for replacement of old bone in terrestrial vertebrates. Recent findings point to the importance of intracellular signals, particularly Ca2+, in osteoclast regulation. However, acid degradation of bone mineral subjects the osteoclast to uniquely high extracellular [Ca2+]. We hypothesized that this high calcium environment would affect calcium signalling mechanisms, and studied the calcium binding regulatory protein, calmodulin, in the osteoclast. Avian osteoclast bone resorption was inhibited 30% at 1 $\mu$M and 90% at 7 $\mu$M by the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine. Osteoclast bone attachment was not affected by 10 $\mu$M trifluoperazine. Quantitative immunofluorescence using fluorescein‐labelled calmodulin monoclonal antibody showed a severalfold increase of calmodulin concentration in bone attached relative to plastic attached osteoclasts. Western blots confirmed this, showing two to threefold increased osteoclast calmodulin per milligram of cell protein in 3‐day bone‐attached vs. nonattached cells. Scanning confocal microscopy showed calmodulin polarization to areas of bone attachment. Electron micrographs with 9nm colloidal gold labelling showed calmodulin in the acid secreting ruffled membrane. ATP‐dependent acid transport in osteoclast membrane vesicles was inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium. This effect was reversed by addition of excess calmodulin, showing that the inhibition is specific. Vesicle acid transport inhibition reflects an approximately fourfold shift in the apparent Km for ATP of vesicular acid transport in the presence of the calmodulin antagonist. We conclude that calmodulin concentration and distribution is modified by bone attachment, and that osteoclastic acid secretion is calmodulin regulated. {\textcopyright} 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

abstract = {The decline and disappearance of Littorella uniflora from oligotrophic waters which have become eutrophic has been associated with shading or reduced CO2 supply. However NO inf3sup- concentrations can reach very high levels (100-2000 mmol m-3 compared with <1-3 in oligotrophic habitats). To investigate the impact of NO inf3sup- loading alone, plants were grown under three NO inf3sup- regimes (very low, near-natural and high). The interactive effects of NO inf3sup- and photon flux density (low and high regimes) on N assimilation and accumulation, CO2 concentrating mechanisms, C3 photosynthesis and growth were also examined. The results were unexpected. Increased NO inf3sup- supply had very little effect on photosynthetic capacity, crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or lacunal CO2 concentrations ([CO2]i), although there was considerable plasticity with respect to light regime. In contrast, increased NO inf3sup- supply resulted in a marked accumulation of NO inf3sup- , free amino acids and soluble protein in shoots and roots (up to 25 mol m-3, 30 mol m-3 and 9 mg g-1 fresh weight respectively in roots), while fresh weight and relative growth rate were reduced. Total N content even under the very low NO inf3sup- regime (1.6-2.3%) was mid-range for aquatic and terrestrial species (and 3.1-4.3% under the high NO inf3sup- regime). These findings, together with field data, suggest that L. uniflora is not growth limited by low NO inf3sup- supply in natural oligotophic habitats, due not to an efficient photosynthetic nitrogen use but to a slow growth rate, a low N requirement and to the use of storage to avoid N stress. However the increased NO inf3sup- concentrations in eutrophic environments seem likely have detrimental effects on the long-term survival of L. uniflora, possibly as a consequence of N accumulation.},
