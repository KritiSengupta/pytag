AB  - One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our 
      planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades 
      since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has 
      accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even 
      the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing 
      millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every 
      continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of 
      plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of 
      discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating 
      on shorelines. Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in 
      the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water 
      convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the 
      continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) 
      in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be 
      hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and 
      non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking 
      and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, 
      absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be 
      ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that 
      trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly 
      increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. 
      The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and 
      the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over 
      the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic 
      debris are still poorly understood.

AB  - Plastics are nowadays considered to be the workhorse material of our modern society 
      with an ubiquitous presence that has increased manifold over the past 60 years, 
      providing several benefits to the global economy. However, inappropriate and/or 
      uncontrolled disposal practices, poor waste management infrastructure and 
      application of insufficient recycling technologies, coupled with a lack of public 
      awareness and incentives, have rendered plastic waste omnipresent, littering both 
      the marine and the terrestrial environment with multi-faceted impacts. This short 
      communication/commentary aims at delineating the plastic litter global challenge 
      providing, at the same time, scientific views and perspectives on properly dealing 
      with this material type, both upstream and downstream.

TI  - Plastics: Environmental and Biotechnological Perspectives on Microbial Degradation.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01095-19 [doi]
LID - e01095-19
AB  - Plastics are widely used in the global economy, and each year, at least 350 to 400 
      million tons are being produced. Due to poor recycling and low circular use, 
      millions of tons accumulate annually in terrestrial or marine environments. Today it 
      has become clear that plastic causes adverse effects in all ecosystems and that 
      microplastics are of particular concern to our health. Therefore, recent microbial 
      research has addressed the question of if and to what extent microorganisms can 
      degrade plastics in the environment. This review summarizes current knowledge on 
      microbial plastic degradation. Enzymes available act mainly on the 
      high-molecular-weight polymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ester-based 
      polyurethane (PUR). Unfortunately, the best PUR- and PET-active enzymes and 
      microorganisms known still have moderate turnover rates. While many reports 
      describing microbial communities degrading chemical additives have been published, 
      no enzymes acting on the high-molecular-weight polymers polystyrene, polyamide, 
      polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, ether-based polyurethane, and polyethylene are 
      known. Together, these polymers comprise more than 80% of annual plastic production. 
      Thus, further research is needed to significantly increase the diversity of enzymes 
      and microorganisms acting on these polymers. This can be achieved by tapping into 
      the global metagenomes of noncultivated microorganisms and dark matter proteins. 
      Only then can novel biocatalysts and organisms be delivered that allow rapid 
      degradation, recycling, or value-added use of the vast majority of most human-made 
      polymers.

AB  - Particulate plastics in the terrestrial and aquatic environments are small plastic 
      fragments or beads (i.e., 5 mm down to the nanometre range). They have been 
      frequently referred to as 'micro-plastics' or 'nano-plastics'. Research has 
      identified particulate plastics as a vector for toxic trace elements in the 
      environment. The adsorption of toxic trace elements by particulate plastics may be 
      facilitated by their high surface area and functionalized surfaces (e.g., through 
      the attachment of natural organic matter). Other factors, such as environmental 
      conditions (e.g., pH and water salinity), surface charge, and trace element 
      oxidation status, also influence the adsorption of trace elements onto particulate 
      plastics. Because of their small size and persistence, particulate plastics and the 
      associated toxic trace elements are readily ingested and accumulated in many 
      terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Thus, these plastics can have severe 
      environmental consequences, such as the development of metal toxicity, within 
      aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Humans could also become exposed to particulate 
      plastics through food chain contamination and airborne ingestion. This review 
      provides an overview of the sources of particulate plastics in the environment. To 
      this end, we describe particulate plastics made of synthetic polymers, their origin, 
      and characteristics with emphasis on how particulate plastics and associated toxic 
      trace elements contaminate terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Future research needs 
      and strategies are discussed to help reduce the environmental risks of particulate 
      plastics as a potent vector for the transportation of toxic trace elements.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are small plastic pieces with size less than 5 mm that have 
      entered and polluted the environment. While many investigations including several 
      critical reviews on MPs in the environment have been conducted, most of them are 
      focused on their occurrences in marine environment. Current understanding on the 
      occurrences, behaviors, and impacts of MPs in the terrestrial environment is far 
      from complete. A systematic review of the literature was thus conducted to promote 
      the research on MPs in the environment. This work is designed to provide a 
      comprehensive overview that summarizes current knowledge and research findings on 
      environmental occurrences, fate and transport, and impacts of MPs. In addition to 
      discussing the occurrences, characteristics, and sources of MPs in the ocean, 
      freshwater, sediments, soils, and atmosphere, the review also summarizes both the 
      experimental and modeling data of the environmental fate and transport of MPs. 
      Research findings on the toxic effects, bioaccumulation, and bioavailability of MPs 
      in the environment are also covered in this critical review. Future perspectives are 
      discussed as well.

AB  - The presence and accumulation of plastic and microplastic (MP) debris in the natural 
      environment is of increasing concern and has become the focus of attention for many 
      researchers. Plastic debris is a prolific, long-lived pollutant that is highly 
      resistant to environmental degradation, readily adheres hydrophobic persistent 
      organic pollutants and is linked to morbidity and mortality in numerous aquatic 
      organisms. The prevalence of MPs within the natural environment is a symptom of 
      continuous and rapid growth in synthetic plastic production and mismanagement of 
      plastic waste. Many terrestrial and marine-based processes, including domestic and 
      industrial drainage, maritime activities agricultural runoff and wastewater 
      treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent, contribute to MP pollution in aquatic 
      environments. MPs have been identified in food consumed by human and in air samples, 
      and exposure to MPs via ingestion or inhalation could lead to adverse human health 
      effects. Regulations in many countries have already been established or will soon be 
      implemented to reduce MPs in aquatic environments. This review focuses on the 
      occurrence, sources, and transport of MPs in terrestrial and aquatic environments to 
      highlight potential human health effects, and applicable regulations to mitigate 
      impacts of MPs. This study also highlights the importance of personality traits and 
      cognitive ability in reducing the entry of MPs into the environment.

AB  - Macro-plastic pollution is found in terrestrial and marine environments and is 
      degraded to micro-particles (MP) and nano-particles (NP) of plastic. These can enter 
      the human food chain either by inhalation or by ingestion, particularly of shellfish 
      and crustaceans. Absorption across the gastrointestinal tract is relatively low, 
      especially for MPs, which appear to have little toxicity. However, NPs are more 
      readily absorbed and may accumulate in the brain, liver and other tissues in aquatic 
      species and other animals. Studies using nanoparticles of other materials suggest 
      that toxicity could potentially affect the central nervous system and the 
      reproductive system, although this would be unlikely unless exposure levels were 
      very high and absorption was increased by physiological factors.

TI  - What is known and unknown about the effects of plastic pollution: A meta-analysis 
      and systematic review.
PG  - e02044
LID - 10.1002/eap.2044 [doi]
AB  - As a consequence of the global ubiquity of plastic pollution, scientists, 
      decision-makers, and the public often ask whether macroplastics (>5 mm) and 
      microplastics (<5 mm) have a realized ecological threat. In 2016, we conducted a 
      systematic review of the literature and made a call for further research testing 
      hypotheses about ecological effects. In the subsequent years, the amount of relevant 
      research has risen tremendously. Here, we reassess the literature to determine the 
      current weight of evidence about the effects of plastic pollution across all levels 
      of biological organization. Our data spans marine, freshwater, and terrestrial 
      environments. We extracted data from 139 lab and field studies testing 577 
      independent effects across a variety of taxa and with various types, sizes, and 
      shapes of plastic. Overall, 59% of the tested effects were detected. Of these, 58% 
      were due to microplastics and 42% were due to macroplastics. Of the effects that 
      were not detected, 94% were from microplastics and 6% were from macroplastics. We 
      found evidence that whether or not an effect is detected, as well as the severity 
      and direction of the effect, is driven by dose, particle shape, polymer type, and 
      particle size. Based on our analyses, there is no doubt that macroplastics are 
      causing ecological effects, however, the effects of microplastics are much more 
      complex. We also assessed the environmental relevancy of experimental studies by 
      comparing the doses used in each exposure to the concentrations and sizes of 
      microplastics found in the environment. We determined that only 17% of the 
      concentrations used in experimental studies have been found in nature, and that 80% 
      of particle sizes used in experiments fall below the size range of the majority of 
      environmental sampling. Based on our systematic review and meta-analysis, we make a 
      call for future work that recognizes the complexity of microplastics and designs 
      tests to better understand how different types, sizes, shapes, doses, and exposure 
      durations affect wildlife. We also call for more ecologically and environmentally 
      relevant studies, particularly in freshwater and terrestrial environments.

TI  - Microplastics as an emerging threat to terrestrial ecosystems.
PG  - 1405-1416
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14020 [doi]
AB  - Microplastics (plastics <5 mm, including nanoplastics which are <0.1 μm) originate 
      from the fragmentation of large plastic litter or from direct environmental 
      emission. Their potential impacts in terrestrial ecosystems remain largely 
      unexplored despite numerous reported effects on marine organisms. Most plastics 
      arriving in the oceans were produced, used, and often disposed on land. Hence, it is 
      within terrestrial systems that microplastics might first interact with biota 
      eliciting ecologically relevant impacts. This article introduces the pervasive 
      microplastic contamination as a potential agent of global change in terrestrial 
      systems, highlights the physical and chemical nature of the respective observed 
      effects, and discusses the broad toxicity of nanoplastics derived from plastic 
      breakdown. Making relevant links to the fate of microplastics in aquatic continental 
      systems, we here present new insights into the mechanisms of impacts on terrestrial 
      geochemistry, the biophysical environment, and ecotoxicology. Broad changes in 
      continental environments are possible even in particle-rich habitats such as soils. 
      Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that microplastics 
      interact with terrestrial organisms that mediate essential ecosystem services and 
      functions, such as soil dwelling invertebrates, terrestrial fungi, and 
      plant-pollinators. Therefore, research is needed to clarify the terrestrial fate and 
      effects of microplastics. We suggest that due to the widespread presence, 
      environmental persistence, and various interactions with continental biota, 
      microplastic pollution might represent an emerging global change threat to 
      terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Plastics are extensively used in our daily life. However, a significant amount of 
      plastic waste is discharged to the environment directly or via improper reuse or 
      recycling. Degradation of plastic waste generates micro- or nano-sized plastic 
      particles that are defined as micro- or nanoplastics (MNPs). Microplastics (MPs) are 
      plastic particles with a diameter less than 5 mm, while nanoplastics (NPs) range in 
      diameter from 1 to 100 or 1000 nm. In the current review, we first briefly 
      summarized the environmental contamination of MNPs and then discussed their health 
      impacts based on existing MNP research. Our review indicates that MNPs can be 
      detected in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide and be ingested and 
      accumulated by animals along the food chain. Evidence has suggested the harmful 
      health impacts of MNPs on marine and freshwater animals. Recent studies found MPs in 
      human stool samples, suggesting that humans are exposed to MPs through food and/or 
      drinking water. However, the effect of MNPs on human health is scarcely researched. 
      In addition to the MNPs themselves, these tiny plastic particles can release plastic 
      additives and/or adsorb other environmental chemicals, many of which have been shown 
      to exhibit endocrine disrupting and other toxic effects. In summary, we conclude 
      that more studies are necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of MNP 
      pollution hazards and also provide a basis for the subsequent pollution management 
      and control.

TI  - Occurrence, Fate and Fluxes of Plastics and Microplastics in Terrestrial and

AB  - Plastics and microplastics are nowadays ubiquitously found in the environment. This 
      has raised concerns on possible adverse effects for human health and the 
      environment. To date, extensive information exists on their occurrence in the marine 
      environment. However, information on their different sources and their transport 
      within and across different freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems is still limited. 
      Therefore, we assessed the current knowledge regarding the industrial sources of 
      plastics and microplastics, their environmental pathways and load rates and their 
      occurrence and fate in different environmental compartments, thereby highlighting 
      important data gaps which are needed to better describe their global environmental 
      cycle and exposure. This study shows that the quantitative assessment of the 
      contribution of the different major sources of plastics, microplastics and 
      nanoplastics to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems is challenged by some data 
      limitations. While the presence of microplastics in wastewater and freshwater is 
      relatively well studied, data on sediments and especially soil ecosystems are too 
      limited. Moreover, the overall occurrence of large-sized plastics, the patterns of 
      microplastic and nanoplastic formation from them, the presence and deposition of 
      plastic particles from the atmosphere and the fluxes of all kinds of plastics from 
      soils towards aquatic environments (e.g. by surface water runoff, soil infiltration) 
      are still poorly understood. Finally, this study discusses several research areas 
      that need urgent development in order to better understand the potential ecological 
      risks of plastic pollution and provides some recommendations to better manage and 
      control plastic and microplastic inputs into the environment.

PG  - 1066-1070
LID - 10.1111/nph.15794 [doi]
AB  - Microplastic effects in terrestrial ecosystems have recently moved into focus, after 
      about a decade of research being limited to aquatic systems. While effects on soil 
      physical properties and soil biota are starting to become apparent, there is not 
      much information on the consequences for plant performance. We here propose and 
      discuss mechanistic pathways through which microplastics could impact plant growth, 
      either positively or negatively. These effects will vary as a function of plant 
      species, and plastic type, and thus are likely to translate to changes in plant 
      community composition and perhaps primary production. Our mechanistic framework 
      serves to guide ongoing and future research on this important topic.

TI  - Anthropogenic noise and the bioacoustics of terrestrial invertebrates.
LID - jeb178749 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.178749 [doi]
AB  - Anthropogenic noise is an important issue of environmental concern owing to its 
      wide-ranging effects on the physiology, behavior and ecology of animals. To date, 
      research has focused on the impacts of far-field airborne noise (i.e. pressure 
      waves) on vertebrates, with few exceptions. However, invertebrates and the other 
      acoustic modalities they rely on, primarily near-field airborne and substrate-borne 
      sound (i.e. particle motion and vibrations, respectively) have received little 
      attention. Here, we review the literature on the impacts of different types of 
      anthropogenic noise (airborne far-field, airborne near-field, substrate-borne) on 
      terrestrial invertebrates. Using literature on invertebrate bioacoustics, we propose 
      a framework for understanding the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on 
      invertebrates and outline predictions of possible constraints and adaptations for 
      invertebrates in responding to anthropogenic noise. We argue that understanding the 
      impacts of anthropogenic noise requires us to consider multiple modalities of sound 
      and to cultivate a broader understanding of invertebrate bioacoustics.

TI  - Microplastic in bottled natural mineral water - literature review and considerations 
      on exposure and risk assessment.
PG  - 2482-2492
LID - 10.1080/19440049.2018.1543957 [doi]
AB  - Microplastics have been ubiquitously found and identified in aquatic and terrestrial 
      environments for several years. Due to their occurrence in the oceans, microplastics 
      were also found and characterised in seafood products and in other foods and 
      beverages such as beer, honey and table salt. Very recently, microplastic particles 
      were also determined in bottled mineral water. The objective of this publication is 
      to present and discuss a compilation of the currently available literature data on 
      microplastics in bottled mineral water. The related oral exposure of the consumer 
      from substances present in microplastics and from the plastics particles themselves 
      is estimated and toxicological arguments for and considerations on risk assessment 
      from the consumption of bottled mineral water containing microplastics are 
      presented. Exposure estimations based on the reported microplastic amounts found in 
      mineral water and the assumption of total mass transfer of small molecules like 
      additives and oligomers present in the plastic would not raise a safety concern. 
      Available toxicokinetic data suggests that marginal fraction of the ingested low 
      amount of microplastics can be absorbed, if at all, the conclusion is very likely 
      that the reported amounts present in bottled mineral water do not raise a safety 
      concern for the consumer. Considering the use of plastic materials in our daily 
      life, occurrence of microplastics in beverages is likely a minor exposure pathway 
      for plastic particles. Due to recent progress in analytical methods and the public 
      discussion on plastics marine litter, public concern about eating and drinking 
      microplastics with food, and related safety issues was raised. However, a better 
      data basis for exposure estimates and risk assessment would be very helpful to 
      better accommodate consumer concerns. The intention of this paper is to deliver a 
      contribution to this topic taking the bottled mineral water as a case example.

PG  - 585836

LID - 585836
AB  - The globally distributed green microalga Chlorella vulgaris (Chlorophyta) colonizes 
      aquatic and terrestrial habitats, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning survival 
      in these two contrasting environments are far from understood. Here, we compared the 
      authentic strain of C. vulgaris from an aquatic habitat with a strain from a 
      terrestrial high alpine habitat previously determined as Chlorella mirabilis. 
      Molecular phylogeny of SSU rDNA (823 bp) showed that the two strains differed by one 
      nucleotide only. Sequencing of the ITS2 region confirmed that both strains belong to 
      the same species, but to distinct ribotypes. Therefore, the terrestrial strain was 
      re-assessed as C. vulgaris. To study the response to environmental conditions 
      experienced on land, we assessed the effects of irradiance and temperature on 
      growth, of temperature on photosynthesis and respiration, and of desiccation and 
      rehydration on photosynthetic performance. In contrast to the aquatic strain, the 
      terrestrial strain tolerated higher temperatures and light conditions, had a higher 
      photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio at 25°C, still grew at 30°C and was able to 
      fully recover photosynthetic performance after desiccation at 84% relative humidity. 
      The two strains differed most in their response to the dehydration/rehydration 
      treatment, which was further investigated by untargeted GC-MS-based metabolite 
      profiling to gain insights into metabolic traits differentiating the two strains. 
      The two strains differed in their allocation of carbon and nitrogen into their 
      primary metabolites. Overall, the terrestrial strain had higher contents of readily 
      available nitrogen-based metabolites, especially amino acids and the polyamine 
      putrescine. Dehydration and rehydration led to differential regulation of the amino 
      acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and sucrose metabolism. The data are 
      discussed with a view to differences in phenotypic plasticity of the two strains, 
      and we suggest that the two genetically almost identical C. vulgaris strains are 
      attractive models to study mechanisms that protect from abiotic stress factors, 
      which are more frequent in terrestrial than aquatic habitats, such as desiccation 
      and irradiation.

AB  - The plastic mulch films used in agriculture are considered to be a major source of 
      the plastic residues found in soil. Mulching with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is 
      widely practiced and the resulting macro- and microscopic plastic residues in 
      agricultural soil have aroused concerns for years. Over the past decades, a variety 
      of biodegradable (Bio) plastics have been developed in the hope of reducing plastic 
      contamination of the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the impact of these Bio 
      plastics in agroecosystems have not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, we 
      investigated the impact of macro (around 5 mm) and micro (<1 mm) sized plastic 
      debris from LDPE and one type of starch-based Bio mulch film on soil physicochemical 
      and hydrological properties. We used environmentally relevant concentrations of 
      plastics, ranging from 0 to 2% (w/w), identified by field studies and literature 
      review. We studied the effects of the plastic residue on a sandy soil for one month 
      in a laboratory experiment. The bulk density, porosity, saturated hydraulic 
      conductivity, field capacity and soil water repellency were altered significantly in 
      the presence of the four kinds of plastic debris, while pH, electrical conductivity 
      and aggregate stability were not substantially affected. Overall, our research 
      provides clear experimental evidence that microplastics affect soil properties. The 
      type, size and content of plastic debris as well as the interactions between these 
      three factors played complex roles in the variations of the measured soil 
      parameters. Living in a plastic era, it is crucial to conduct further 
      interdisciplinary studies in order to have a comprehensive understanding of plastic 
      debris in soil and agroecosystems.

AB  - Current data regarding the effects of microplastic (MP) on terrestrial organisms are 
      very scarce. Isopods play an important role in plant litter decomposition processes 
      and are commonly used test species in terrestrial ecotoxicity studies. Their altered 
      feeding behaviour and energy reserves are established biomarkers of adverse effects 
      upon stressor exposure. For this study we assessed the effects of MP derived from 
      plastic bag film (mean size 183±93μm) and particles from a facial cleanser (mean 
      size 137±51μm) on the terrestrial isopod, Porcellio scaber. Isopods were exposed to 
      MP via feeding on food pellets (4mgg(-1) dry weight; 0.4% w w(-1)) for 14days under 
      laboratory conditions. A control group was exposed to food pellets with no MP added. 
      In line with previously suggested modes of MP action on animal ingestion, we 
      assessed the food ingestion rate, defecation rate, food assimilation rate and 
      efficiency, body mass change, mortality and energy reserves (proteins, 
      carbohydrates, and triglycerides) in the digestive glands (hepatopancreas) of 
      individual isopods. Contrary to our expectations, no effects on either end-point 
      were observed under the given exposure conditions. Further work should be carried 
      out to investigate the potential longer-term effects of such exposure. We conclude 
      that 14days exposure to plastic bag and facial cleanser MP is not severely hazardous 
      to isopods.

AB  - The massive production of plastic started in mid 20th century. Today, only 60 years 
      later and despite its obvious benefits, plastic pollution is ubiquitous, influencing 
      all global environments and the planet's biota, including human-well-being. Plastic 
      pollution may interact with other global change drivers, having large-scale, remote 
      and long-lasting effects. Here we highlight that plastic pollution should be 
      considered a main topic for global change research in the 21st century, especially 
      among terrestrial ecologists at understudied continental regions such as South 
      America.

AB  - The ubiquitous occurrences of microplastics in the environment have raised much 
      concern and resulted in voluminous studies related to microplastics. Studies on 
      microplastics pollution of the marine environment have received significantly higher 
      attention compared to those of the freshwater and terrestrial environments. With the 
      impetus to better understand microplastics in the freshwater and terrestrial 
      environments, this review elucidates the findings of >100 articles related to the 
      prevalence, fates and impacts of microplastics therein and the sustainable 
      solutions, mostly in the past 10 years. This review shows the interconnection 
      between terrestrial and freshwater microplastics with wastewater and sewage 
      treatment plants as the most significant contributors of environmental microplastics 
      via sludge and effluent discharges. Microplastics in both ecosystems comprise the 
      primary and secondary forms with the latter resulted from weathering of the former. 
      Besides retaining in soil and infiltrating with rainwater underground, terrestrial 
      microplastics also enter the freshwater environment. The environmental microplastics 
      interact with the biotic and abiotic components resulting in entrainment, 
      settlement, biofouling, degradation, fragmentation and entry into the food chain, 
      with subsequent transfer across the food chain. The abundance of environmental 
      microplastics is attributed to population density and urbanization though tidal 
      cycle, storms, floods and human activities can affect their distribution. The 
      leaching of additives from microplastics poses major health concern and sustainable 
      solutions target at reduction of plastics use and disposal, substitution with 
      bioplastics and wastewater treatment innovations. Further studies on classification, 
      detection, characterization and toxicity of microplastics are necessary to permit 
      more effective formulation of solutions.

AB  - Microplastics and nanoplastics are emerging pollutants of global importance. They 
      are small enough to be ingested by a wide range of organisms and at nano-scale, they 
      may cross some biological barriers. However, our understanding of their ecological 
      impact on the terrestrial environment is limited. Plastic particle loading in 
      agroecosystems could be high due to inputs of some recycled organic waste and 
      plastic film mulching, so it is vital that we develop a greater understanding of any 
      potentially harmful or adverse impacts of these pollutants to agroecosystems. In 
      this article, we discuss the sources of plastic particles in agroecosystems, the 
      mechanisms, constraints and dynamic behaviour of plastic during aging on land, and 
      explore the responses of soil organisms and plants at different levels of biological 
      organisation to plastic particles of micro and nano-scale. Based on limited evidence 
      at this point and understanding that the lack of evidence of ecological impact from 
      microplastic and nanoplastic in agroecosystems does not equate to the evidence of 
      absence, we propose considerations for addressing the gaps in knowledge so that we 
      can adequately safeguard world food supply.

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that microplastic pollution represents one of the 
      greatest anthropogenically mediated threats to Earth-system functioning. In 
      freshwater and marine ecosystems the presence of large amounts of microplastic 
      appears almost ubiquitous, with frequent reports of negative impacts on aquatic 
      health. In contrast, however, the impact of plastic in terrestrial environments 
      remains poorly understood. In agroecosystems, microplastics (particles < 5 mm) can 
      enter the soil environment either directly (e.g. from biosolids application, 
      irrigation water, atmospheric deposition), or indirectly through the in situ 
      degradation of large pieces of plastic (e.g. from plastic mulch films). Although we 
      have encouraged the use of plastics over the last 50 years in agriculture to promote 
      greater resource use efficiency and food security, the legacy of this is that many 
      soils are now contaminated with large amounts of plastic residue (ca. 
      50-250 kg ha(-1)). Due to difficulties in separating and quantifying plastic 
      particles from soil, our knowledge of their behavior, fate and potential to transfer 
      to other receptors (e.g. surface and groundwater, air) and enter the human food 
      chain remains poor. This information, however, is critical for evaluating the risk 
      of soil-borne microplastic pollution. In this critical review, we systematically

AB  - Plastic mulching is suspected to be a significant source of microplastics in 
      terrestrial environments owing to its intensive application and improper disposal. 
      However, there has been a comparative lack of studies examining this hypothesis. In 
      this study, the occurrence of macroplastics in agricultural soils was investigated 
      by analysing 384 soil samples collected from 19 provinces across China. 
      Additionally, the abundance of microplastics was investigated in potential hotspots 
      that have carried out plastic mulching for over 30 years. Macroplastic 
      concentrations in the soil samples ranged from 0.1 to 324.5 kg/ha, with an average 
      of 83.6 kg/ha; the concentrations were higher in western China than in eastern 
      China. A highly significant linear correlation (R(2) = 0.61) was found between the 
      consumption of mulching film and the plastic residue in soils, indicating plastic 
      film mulching may be a major source of macroplastics. The abundances of microplastic 
      particles increased over time in the locations where plastic mulching was 
      continuously employed, with concentrations of 80.3 ± 49.3, 308 ± 138.1, and 
      1075.6 ± 346.8 pieces/kg soil in fields with 5, 15, and 24 y of continuous mulching, 
      respectively. Fourier transform infrared analyses revealed that the composition of 
      the microplastics matched that of the mulching films, suggesting the microplastic 
      particles originated from the mulching films. These findings confirm that plastic 
      mulching is an important source of macroplastic and microplastic contamination in 
      terrestrial environments. Further studies to investigate the microplastic hazards in 
      soils are thus necessary.

TI  - Terrestrial acclimation and exercise lead to bone functional response in Polypterus 
      senegalus pectoral fins.
LID - jeb217554 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.217554 [doi]
AB  - The ability of bones to sense and respond to mechanical loading is a central feature 
      of vertebrate skeletons. However, the functional demands imposed on terrestrial and 
      aquatic animals differ vastly. The pectoral girdle of the basal actinopterygian fish 
      Polypterus senegalus was previously shown to exhibit plasticity following 
      terrestrial acclimation, but the pectoral fin itself has yet to be examined. We 
      investigated skeletal plasticity in the pectoral fins of P. senegalus after exposure 
      to terrestrial loading. Juvenile fish were divided into three groups: a control 
      group was kept under aquatic conditions without intervention, an exercised group was 
      also kept in water but received daily exercise on land, and a terrestrial group was 
      kept in a chronic semi-terrestrial condition. After 5 weeks, the pectoral fins were 
      cleared and stained with Alcian Blue and Alizarin Red to visualize cartilage and 
      bone, allowing measurements of bone length, bone width, ossification and curvature 
      to be taken for the endochondral radial bones. Polypterus senegalus fin bones 
      responded most strongly to chronic loading in the terrestrial condition. Fish that 
      were reared in a terrestrial environment had significantly longer bones compared 
      with those of aquatic controls, wider propterygia and metapterygia, and more 
      ossified metapterygia and medial radials, and they showed changes in propterygial 
      curvature. Exercised fish also had longer and more ossified medial radials compared 
      with those of controls. Polypterus senegalus fin bones exhibit plasticity in 
      response to novel terrestrial loading. Such plasticity could be relevant for 
      transitions between water and land on evolutionary scales, but key differences 
      between fish and tetrapod bone make direct comparisons challenging.

LID - e88006
AB  - Much attention has been paid to the impacts of plastics and other debris on marine 
      organisms, but the effects of plastic on terrestrial organisms have been largely 
      ignored. Detrimental effects of terrestrial plastic could be most pronounced in 
      intensively human-modified landscapes (e.g., urban and agricultural areas), which 
      are a source of much anthropogenic debris. Here, we examine the occurrence, types, 
      landscape associations, and consequences of anthropogenic nest material in the 
      American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a North American species that breeds in both 
      urban and agricultural landscapes. We monitored 195 nestlings in 106 nests across an 
      urban and agricultural gradient in the Sacramento Valley, California, USA. We found 
      that 85.2% of crow nests contained anthropogenic material, and 11 of 195 nestlings 
      (5.6%) were entangled in their nests. The length of the material was greater in 
      nests in agricultural territories than in urban territories, and the odds of 
      entanglement increased 7.55 times for each meter of anthropogenic material in the 
      nest. Fledging success was significantly lower for entangled than for unentangled 
      nestlings. In all environments, particularly urban, agricultural, and marine, 
      careful disposal of potential hazards (string, packing and hay bale twine, balloon 
      ribbon, wire, fishing line) could reduce the occurrence of entanglement of nestling 
      birds.

TI  - Transport behaviors of plastic particles in saturated quartz sand without and with 
      biochar/Fe(3)O(4)-biochar amendment.

AB  - As an environmentally friendly material, biochar has been widely used to remediate 
      soil/water contaminants such as heavy metals and organic pollutants. The addition of 
      biochar or modified biochar to porous media might affect the retention of plastic 
      particles and thus influence their fate in natural environment. In this study, both 
      biochar and magnetic biochar (Fe(3)O(4)-biochar) were synthesized via a facile 
      precipitation method at room temperature. To determine the significance of biochar 
      and Fe(3)O(4)-biochar amendment on the transport and deposition behaviors of plastic 
      particles, the breakthrough curves and retained profiles of three different sized 
      plastic particles (0.02 μm nano-plastic particles, and 0.2 μm and 2 μm micro-plastic 
      particles) in quartz sand were compared with those obtained in quartz sand either 
      with biochar or Fe(3)O(4)-biochar amendment in both 5 mM and 25 mM NaCl solutions. 
      The results show that for all three different sized plastic particles under both 
      examined solution conditions, the addition of biochar and Fe(3)O(4)-biochar in 
      quartz sand decreases the transport and increases the retention of plastic particles 
      in porous media. Fe(3)O(4)-biochar more effectively inhibits the transport of 
      plastic particles than biochar. We found that the addition of 
      biochar/Fe(3)O(4)-biochar could change the suspension property and increase the 
      adsorption capacity of porous media (due to the increase of porous media surface 
      roughness and negatively decrease the zeta potentials of porous media), contributing 
      to the enhanced deposition of plastic particles. Moreover, we found that negligible 
      amount of biochar and Fe(3)O(4)-biochar (<1%) were released from the columns 
      following the plastic particle transport when the columns were eluted with very low 
      ionic strength solution at high flow rate (to simulate a sudden rainstorm). 
      Similarly, small amount of plastic particles were detached from the porous media 
      under this extreme condition (16.5% for quartz sand, 14.6% for quartz sand with 
      biochar amendment, and 7.5% for quartz sand with Fe(3)O(4)-biochar amendment). We 
      found that over 74% of the Fe(3)O(4)-biochar can be recovered from the porous media 
      after the retention of plastic particles by using a magnet and 87% plastic particles 
      could be desorbed from Fe(3)O(4)-biochar by dispersing the Fe(3)O(4)-biochar into 
      10 mM NaOH solution. In addition, we found that the amendment of unsaturated porous 
      media with biochar/Fe(3)O(4)-biochar also decreased the transport of plastic 
      particles. When biochar/Fe(3)O(4)-biochar were added into porous media as one layer 
      of permeable barrier near to column inlet, the decreased transport of plastic 
      particles could be also obtained. The results of this study indicate that magnetic 
      biochar can be potentially applied to immobilize plastic particles in terrestrial 
      ecosystems such as in soil or groundwater.

AB  - Phthalate esters (PEs, Phthalates) are environmentally ubiquitous as a result of 
      their extensive use as plasticizers and additives in diverse consumer products. 
      Considerable concern relates to their reported xenoestrogenicity and consequently, 
      microbial-based attenuation of environmental PE concentrations is of interest to 
      combat harmful downstream effects. Fungal PE catabolism has received less attention 
      than that by bacteria, and particularly fungi dwelling within aquatic environments 
      remain largely overlooked in this respect. We have compared the biocatalytic and 
      biosorptive removal rates of di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP), 
      chosen to represent two environmentally prominent PEs of differing structure and 
      hydrophobicity, by marine-, freshwater-, and terrestrial-derived fungal strains. 
      Bisphenol A, both an extensively used plastic additive and prominent environmental 
      xenoestrogen, was included as a reference compound due to its well-documented fungal 
      degradation. Partial pathways of DBP metabolization by the ecophysiologically 
      diverse asco- and basidiomycete strains tested were proposed with the help of 
      UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. Species specific biochemical reaction steps contributing to 
      DBP metabolism were also observed. The involved reactions include initial cytochrome 
      P450-dependent monohydroxylations of DBP with subsequent further oxidation of 
      related metabolites, de-esterification via either hydrolytic cleavage or cytochrome 
      P450-dependent oxidative O-dealkylation, transesterification, and demethylation 
      steps - finally yielding phthalic acid as a central intermediate in all pathways. 
      Due to the involvement of ecophysiologically and phylogenetically diverse 
      filamentous and yeast-like fungi native to marine, freshwater, and terrestrial 
      habitats the results of this study outline an environmentally ubiquitous pathway for 
      the biocatalytic breakdown of plastic additives. Beyond previous research into 
      fungal PE metabolism which emphasizes hydrolytic de-esterification as the primary 
      catabolic step, a prominent role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-catalyzed 
      reactions is established.

AB  - The presence of microplastics in the marine environment poses a great threat to the 
      entire ecosystem and has received much attention lately as the presence has greatly 
      impacted oceans, lakes, seas, rivers, coastal areas and even the Polar Regions. 
      Microplastics are found in most commonly utilized products (primary microplastics), 
      or may originate from the fragmentation of larger plastic debris (secondary 
      microplastics). The material enters the marine environment through terrestrial and 
      land-based activities, especially via runoffs and is known to have great impact on 
      marine organisms as studies have shown that large numbers of marine organisms have 
      been affected by microplastics. Microplastic particles have been found distributed 
      in large numbers in Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, India, South Africa, North 
      America, and in Europe. This review describes the sources and global distribution of 
      microplastics in the environment, the fate and impact on marine biota, especially 
      the food chain. Furthermore, the control measures discussed are those mapped out by 
      both national and international environmental organizations for combating the impact 
      from microplastics. Identifying the main sources of microplastic pollution in the 
      environment and creating awareness through education at the public, private, and 
      government sectors will go a long way in reducing the entry of microplastics into 
      the environment. Also, knowing the associated behavioral mechanisms will enable 
      better understanding of the impacts for the marine environment. However, a more 
      promising and environmentally safe approach could be provided by exploiting the 
      potentials of microorganisms, especially those of marine origin that can degrade 
      microplastics. CAPSULE: The concentration, distribution sources and fate of 
      microplastics in the global marine environment were discussed, so also was the 
      impact of microplastics on a wide range of marine biota.

TI  - Harvest-induced evolution: insights from aquatic and terrestrial systems.
LID - 20160036
AB  - Commercial and recreational harvests create selection pressures for fitness-related 
      phenotypic traits that are partly under genetic control. Consequently, harvesting 
      can drive evolution in targeted traits. However, the quantification of 
      harvest-induced evolutionary life history and phenotypic changes is challenging, 
      because both density-dependent feedback and environmental changes may also affect 
      these changes through phenotypic plasticity. Here, we synthesize current knowledge 
      and uncertainties on six key points: (i) whether or not harvest-induced evolution is 
      happening, (ii) whether or not it is beneficial, (iii) how it shapes biological 
      systems, (iv) how it could be avoided, (v) its importance relative to other drivers 
      of phenotypic changes, and (vi) whether or not it should be explicitly accounted for 
      in management. We do this by reviewing findings from aquatic systems exposed to 
      fishing and terrestrial systems targeted by hunting. Evidence from aquatic systems 
      emphasizes evolutionary effects on age and size at maturity, while in terrestrial 
      systems changes are seen in weapon size and date of parturition. We suggest that 
      while harvest-induced evolution is likely to occur and negatively affect 
      populations, the rate of evolutionary changes and their ecological implications can 
      be managed efficiently by simply reducing harvest intensity.This article is part of 
      the themed issue 'Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal 
      consequences'.

AB  - Plastic pollution in the environment is currently receiving worldwide attention. 
      Improper dumping of disused or abandoned plastic wastes leads to contamination of 
      the environment. In particular, the disposal of municipal wastewater effluent, 
      sewage sludge landfill, and plastic mulch from agricultural activities is a serious 
      issue and of major concern regarding soil pollution. Compared to plastic pollution 
      in the marine and freshwater ecosystems, that in the soil ecosystem has been 
      relatively neglected. In this study, we discussed plastic pollution in the soil 
      environment and investigated research on the effects of plastic wastes, especially 
      microplastics, on the soil ecosystem. We found that earthworms have been 
      predominantly used as the test species in investigating the effects of soil plastic 
      pollution on organisms. Therefore, further research investigating the effects of 
      plastic on other species models (invertebrates, plants, microorganisms, and insects) 
      are required to understand the effects of plastic pollution on the overall soil 
      ecosystem. In addition, we suggest other perspectives for future studies on plastic 
      pollution and soil ecotoxicity of plastics wastes, providing a direction for such 
      research.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs), which are new environmental pollutants with a diameter of 
      <5 mm, have received wide attention in recent years. However, there are still very 
      limited data regarding the risks of MPs to animals, especially higher mammals. In 
      this study, we exposed male mice to 5 μm pristine and fluorescent polystyrene MP for 
      six weeks. The results showed that the polystyrene MP was observed in the guts of 
      mice and could reduce the intestinal mucus secretion and cause damage the intestinal 
      barrier function. In addition, high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 
      16S rRNA gene was used to explore the change of the gut microbiota composition in 
      the cecal content. At the phylum level, the content of Actinobacteria decreased 
      significantly in the polystyrene MP-treated group. The PD whole-tree indexes of the 
      alpha diversity and principal component analysis (PCA) of the beta diversity 
      indicated that the diversity of gut microbiota was altered after polystyrene MP 
      exposure. At the genus level, a total of 15 types of bacteria changed significantly 
      after exposure to polystyrene MP. Furthermore, the predicted KEGG (Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) metabolic pathway differences indicated that the 
      main metabolic pathways of the functional genes in the microbial community were 
      significantly influenced by the polystyrene MP. In addition, indexes of amino acid 
      metabolism and bile acid metabolism in the serum were analyzed after polystyrene MP 
      exposure. These results indicated that polystyrene MP caused metabolic disorders. In 
      conclusion, the polystyrene MP induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal barrier 
      dysfunction and metabolic disorders in mice. This study provided more data on the 
      toxicity of MPs in a terrestrial organism to aid in the assessment of the health 
      risks of polystyrene MP to animals.

AB  - Since the last few decades, the promiscuous and uncontrolled use of plastics led to 
      the accumulation of millions of tons of plastic waste in the terrestrial and marine 
      environment. It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate change. The 
      concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of plastics 
      containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide, 
      polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are 
      very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient, 
      eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of 
      non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, 
      fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few microbial 
      agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and characterized for plastic 
      degradation, but with low efficiency. It might be due to the predominance of 
      uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain unexplored from the 
      respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this problem, metagenomic analysis 
      of microbial population engaged in the plastic biodegradation is advisable to 
      decipher the microbial community structure and to predict their biodegradation 
      potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics 
      analysis allow the rapid metagenome screening that helps in the identification of 
      total microbial community and also opens up the scope for mining genes or enzymes 
      (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in polymer degradation. Further, the extraction 
      of the core microbial population and their adaptation, fitness, and survivability 
      can also be deciphered through comparative metagenomic study. It will help to 
      engineer the microbial community and their metabolic activity to speed up the 
      degradation process.

AB  - Plastic debris is an environmentally persistent and complex contaminant of 
      increasing concern. Understanding the sources, abundance and composition of 
      microplastics present in the environment is a huge challenge due to the fact that 
      hundreds of millions of tonnes of plastic material is manufactured for societal use 
      annually, some of which is released to the environment. The majority of 
      microplastics research to date has focussed on the marine environment. Although 
      freshwater and terrestrial environments are recognised as origins and transport 
      pathways of plastics to the oceans, there is still a comparative lack of knowledge 
      about these environmental compartments. It is highly likely that microplastics will 
      accumulate within continental environments, especially in areas of high 
      anthropogenic influence such as agricultural or urban areas. This review critically 
      evaluates the current literature on the presence, behaviour and fate of 
      microplastics in freshwater and terrestrial environments and, where appropriate, 
      also draws on relevant studies from other fields including nanotechnology, 
      agriculture and waste management. Furthermore, we evaluate the relevant biological 
      and chemical information from the substantial body of marine microplastic 
      literature, determining the applicability and comparability of this data to 
      freshwater and terrestrial systems. With the evidence presented, the authors have 
      set out the current state of the knowledge, and identified the key gaps. These 
      include the volume and composition of microplastics entering the environment, 
      behaviour and fate of microplastics under a variety of environmental conditions and 
      how characteristics of microplastics influence their toxicity. Given the technical 
      challenges surrounding microplastics research, it is especially important that 
      future studies develop standardised techniques to allow for comparability of data. 
      The identification of these research needs will help inform the design of future 
      studies, to determine both the extent and potential ecological impacts of 
      microplastic pollution in freshwater and terrestrial environments.

AB  - As a kind of newly emerging pollutant, nanoplastics are easily to be ingested by 
      organisms, and cause severe damage to biological functions because of their small 
      size, high specific surface area, and strong biological penetration. Recently, there 
      are increasing reports of numerous airborne microplastics, including polystyrene 
      (PS), being detected in atmospheric samples, which implies a potential risk to the 
      human respiratory system. In this work, we evaluated the effects of polystyrene 
      nanoparticles of two different sizes (PS-NP25: 25 nm diameter and PS-NP70: 70 nm 
      diameter) on the human alveolar epithelial A549 cell line including internalization, 
      cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, and associated gene transcription and protein 
      expression. Results showed that PS-NP25 was internalized more rapidly and 
      efficiently into the cytoplasm of A549 than PS-NP70. PS-NPs significantly affected 
      the cell viability, caused cell cycle S phrase arrest, activated inflammatory gene 
      transcription, and changed the expression of proteins associated with cell cycle and 
      pro-apoptosis. PS-NPs induced significant up-regulation of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines such as IL-8, NF-κB, and TNF-α, as well as pro-apoptotic proteins such as 
      DR5, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and cytochrome c, which revealed that PS-NPs 
      triggered a TNF-α-associated apoptosis pathway. This study suggests that exposure 
      duration, diameter, and concentration are the key factors for evaluating the 
      toxicological effects of PS-NPs on alveolar epithelial cells. More attention must be 
      focused on the risk of nanoplastic-related air pollution and the environmental 
      toxicological effects of nanoplastics on humans and other terrestrial mammals.

AB  - Release of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) into agricultural fields is of 
      great concern due to their reported ecotoxicity to organisms that provide beneficial 
      service to the soil such as earthworms, and the potential ability of MPs and NPs to 
      enter the food chain. Most fundamental studies of the fate and transport of plastic 
      particulates in terrestrial environments employ idealized MP materials as models, 
      such as monodisperse polystyrene spheres. In contrast, plastics that reside in 
      agricultural soils consist of polydisperse fragments resulting from degraded films 
      employed in agriculture. There exists a need for more representative materials in 
      fundamental studies of the fate, transport, and ecotoxicity of MPs and NPs in soil 
      ecosystems. The objective of this study was therefore to develop a procedure to 
      produce MPs and NPs from agricultural plastics (a mulch film prepared biodegradable 
      polymer polybutyrate adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) and low-density PE [LDPE]), and 
      to characterize the resultant materials. Soaking of PBAT films under cryogenic 
      conditions promoted embrittlement, similar to what occurs through environmental 
      weathering. LDPE and cryogenically-treated PBAT underwent mechanical milling 
      followed by sieve fractionation into MP fractions of 840 μm, 250 μm, 106 μm, and 
      45 μm. The 106 μm fraction was subjected to wet grinding to produce NPs of average 
      particle size 366.0 nm and 389.4 nm for PBAT and LDPE, respectively. A two-parameter 
      Weibull model described the MPs' particle size distributions, while NPs possessed 
      bimodal distributions. Size reduction did not produce any changes in the chemical 
      properties of the plastics, except for slight depolymerization and an increase of 
      crystallinity resulting from cryogenic treatment. This study suggests that MPs form 
      from cutting and high-impact mechanical degradation as would occur during the 
      tillage into soil, and that NPs form from the MP fragments in regions of relative 
      weakness that possess lower molecular weight polymers and crystallinity.

PG  - 123-39

AB  - As climate change progresses, we are observing widespread changes in phenotypes in 
      many plant populations. Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by 
      climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are 
      active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing 
      these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly 
      occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic 
      or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, 
      may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 
      studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether 
      evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by 
      contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the 
      extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental 
      changes, species' life history characteristics including generation time and 
      breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow. Future studies with 
      standardized methodologies, especially those that use direct approaches assessing 
      responses to climate change over time, and sharing of data through public databases, 
      will facilitate better predictions of the capacity for plant populations to respond 
      to rapid climate change.

AB  - The environmental impact of exposure to 3D-printed plastics as well as potential 
      migration of toxic chemicals from 3D-printed plastics remains largely unexplored. In 
      this work we applied leachates from plastics fabricated using a stereolithography 
      (SLA) process to early developmental stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 
      investigate developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity. Migration of unpolymerized 
      photoinitiator, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (1-HCHPK) from a plastic solid 
      phase to aqueous media at up to 200 mg/L in the first 24 h was detected using gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both plastic extracts (LC(50) 22.25% v/v) and 
      1-HCHPK (LC(50) 60 mg/L) induced mortality and teratogenicity within 48 h of 
      exposure. Developmental toxicity correlated with in situ generation of reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS), an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation 
      markers and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 
      glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in embryos exposed to concentrations as low as 20% 
      v/v for plastic extracts and 16 mg/L for 1-HCHPK. ROS-induced cellular damage led to 
      induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis which could be pharmacologically inhibited 
      with both antioxidant ascorbic acid and a pan-caspase inhibitor. Neuro-behavioral 
      analysis showed that exposure to plastic leachates reduced spontaneous embryonic 
      movement in 24-36 hpf embryos. Plastic extracts in concentrations above 20% v/v 
      induced rapid retardation of locomotion, changes in photomotor response and 
      habituation to photic stimuli with progressive paralysis in 120 hpf larvae. 
      Significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity with lack of any 
      CNS-specific apoptotic phenotypes as well as lack of changes in motor neuron 
      density, axonal growth, muscle segment integrity or presence of myoseptal defects 
      were detected upon exposure to plastic extracts during embryogenesis. Considering 
      implications of the results for environmental risk assessment and the growing usage 
      of 3D-printing technologies, we speculate that some 3D-printed plastic waste may 
      represent a significant and yet very poorly uncharacterized environmental hazard 
      that merits further investigation on a range of aquatic and terrestrial species.

AB  - While a large body of literature has shown that microplastics (MPs) are highly 
      likely to be accumulated in marine organisms and terrestrial animals, information 
      about toxicity of MPs in mammal from a mechanistic point of view is more limited. 
      Our paper fills this knowledge gap by assessing polystyrene (PS)-MPs-mice system 
      based on toxicity-based toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic (TBTK/TD) modeling to quantify 
      organ-bioaccumulation and biomarker responses appraised with published dataset. The 
      key TBTK-parameters for mice liver, kidney, and gut posed by 5 or 20 μm PS-MPs could 
      be obtained. We found that gut had the highest bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of ∼8 
      exposed to 5 μm PS-MPs with a mean residence time of ∼17 days. We showed that 
      threshold concentrations of 5 and 20 μm PS-MPs among the most sensitive biomarkers 
      were 8 ± 5 (mean ± SE) and 0.71 ± 0.14 μg g(-1) bw, respectively, implicating that 
      particle size was likely to affect TK/TD behavior in mice. The mice-based TK 
      parameters and threshold criteria greatly assist in designing robust researches to 
      evaluate MP consumption by humans. We establish a TBTK/TD framework for 
      mechanistically assessing potential from mice size-specific MPs exposure that would 
      offer a tool-kit for extrapolating to humans from health risk assessment 
      perspective.

      Exposure.

AB  - The ubiquity of microplastics in aquatic and terrestrial environments and related 
      ecological impacts have gained global attention. Microplastics have been detected in 
      table salt, drinking water, and air, posing inevitable human exposure risk. However, 
      rigorous analytical methods for detection and characterization of microplastics 
      remain scarce. Knowledge about the potential adverse effects on human health via 
      dietary and respiratory exposures is also limited. To address these issues, we 
      reviewed 46 publications concerning abundances, potential sources, and analytical 
      methods of microplastics in table salt, drinking water, and air. We also summarized 
      probable translocation and accumulation pathways of microplastics within human body. 
      Human body burdens of microplastics through table salt, drinking water, and 
      inhalation were estimated to be (0-7.3)×10(4), (0-4.7)×10(3), and (0-3.0)×10(7) 
      items per person per year, respectively. The intake of microplastics via inhalation, 
      especially via indoor air, was much higher than those via other exposure routes. 
      Moreover, microplastics in the air impose threats to both respiratory and digestive 
      systems through breathing and ingestion. Given the lifetime inevitable exposure to 
      microplastics, we urgently call for a better understanding of the potential hazards 
      of microplastics to human health.

AB  - Electronic waste (e-waste) recycling site may be a "hotspot" for pollution of 
      plastic debris, which has not been well studied. Eighteen halogenated flame 
      retardants (HFRs) were measured in plastics and soil separated from twenty soil 
      samples, respectively, from an abandoned e-waste recycling site. Abundances and 
      concentrations of plastic debris ranged from 600 to 14,200 particles/kg and 
      0.24-153 mg/g, respectively, which were at the high end in literature. Blue, black, 
      and red were main plastic colors, and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) was the 
      main type of plastics. Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) 209 was the main 
      chemical, with median concentrations of 6.22-40.6 μg/g in soil and 28.1-47.2 μg/g in 
      plastics, respectively. Contributions of HFRs in plastics were less than 10% in 
      total HFR masses in bulk soil samples. Exposure values to HFRs from plastics via 
      soil ingestion and dermal contact with soil were generally two orders of magnitude 
      lower than those from soil. The results indicate that plastics in soil have little 
      contribution to total HFR burden in soil and human exposure risks to HFRs in this 
      study. However, ecological risks of plastics to terrestrial wildlife in e-waste 
      sites should be paid attention.

AB  - The production of synthetic oil-based plastics has led to the accumulation of huge 
      amounts of the plastic waste in the environment, especially in the marine system, 
      very often the final sink for many types of conventional wasted plastics. In 
      particular, (micro)plastics account for the majority of litter items in the marine 
      environment and a high percentage of such litter is originating from land sources. 
      Attempts to mitigate the harmful effects of conventional plastics such as the 
      development of novel management strategies together with the gradual substitution of 
      them with biodegradable (bio)plastics are representing future solutions. However, 
      high amounts of conventional plastics have been accumulating in the environment 
      since several years. Although many studies reported on their potential 
      biodegradation by microbes in and from terrestrial environments, very little is 
      known about the biodegradability of these plastics in freshwater systems and only 
      recently more reports on their biodegradation by marine microorganisms/in marine 
      environment were made available. In this review, we first provide a summary of the 
      approaches applied for monitoring and assessing conventional plastics biodegradation 
      under defined conditions. Then, we reviewed historical and recent findings related 
      to biodegradation of four major plastics produced in European Union (EU), i.e. 
      Polyethylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, Polypropylene and Polystyrene, in terrestrial and 
      aquatic environments and by pure and mixed microbial cultures obtained from them.

AB  - Morphological and ecological differences of two forms of Helosciadium repens are 
      known and described in the literature: aquatic and terrestrial. However, their 
      taxonomic status is currently unknown. The question whether they are genotypically 
      adapted to specific environmental conditions or are those differences a result of 
      phenotypic plasticity is addressed in this study.SSR and ISSR data were used to 
      uncover genotypic differences. Data from drought stress experiments (system water 
      content and relative water content of leaves) were used to evaluate the response to 
      water as an environmental factor. The stomatal index of both forms grown under 
      different water treatments was analyzed.The principal component analysis of the ISSR 
      data revealed no clustering that would correspond with ecotypes. The diversity 
      parameters of the SSR data showed no significant differences. The aquatic 
      populations showed a tendency toward heterozygosity, while the terrestrial ones 
      showed a bias toward homozygosity. Both forms responded similarly to the changes in 
      water availability, with newly produced leaves after drought stress that were better 
      adapted to repeated drought stress. Stomatal indices were higher in plants from 
      aquatic habitats, but these differences disappeared when the plants were grown in 
      soil.The observed responses indicate that the differences between forms are due to 
      phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Plastic packaging accounts for 36% of all plastics made, but amounts to 47% of all 
      plastic waste; 90% of all plastic items are used once and then discarded, which 
      corresponds to around 50% of the total mass of plastics manufactured. Evidence for 
      the ubiquity of microplastic pollution is accumulating rapidly, and wherever such 
      material is sought, it seems to be found. Thus, microplastics have been identified 
      in Arctic ice, the air, food and drinking water, soils, rivers, aquifers, remote 
      maintain regions, glaciers, the oceans and ocean sediments, including waters and 
      deep sea sediments around Antarctica, and within the deepest marine trenches of the 
      Earth. They have also been detected in the bodies of animals, including humans, and 
      as being passed along the hierarchy of food chains, up to marine top predators. 
      Evidence has also been presented that microplastics are able to cross different life 
      stages of mosquito that use different habitats - larva (feeding) to pupa 
      (non-feeding) to adult terrestrial (flying) - and therefore can be spread from 
      aquatic systems by flying insects. The so-called 'missing plastic problem' appears 
      to be, in part, due to limitations in sampling methods, that is, many of the very 
      small microplastic particles may simply escape capture in the trawl nets that are 
      typically employed to collect them, but have been evidenced in grab-sampling 
      experiments. Moreover, it is simply not possible to measure entirely through the 
      vast, oceanic volumes of the oceans. It can, however, be concluded with some 
      confidence that the majority of the plastic is not located at the sea surface, and 
      indeed, several different sinks have been proposed for microplastics, including the 
      sea floor and sediments, the ocean column itself, ice sheets, glaciers and soils. 
      The treatment of land with sewage sludge is also thought to make a significant 
      contribution of microplastics to soil. A substantial amount of airborne 
      microparticulate pollution is created by the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces (and 
      other 'non-exhaust' sources), meaning that even electric vehicles are not 'clean' in 
      this regard, despite their elimination of tailpipe PM(2.5) and PM(10) emissions. The 
      emergence of nanoplastics in the environment poses a new set of potential threats, 
      although any impacts on human health are not yet known, save, as indicated from 
      model studies. While improved design, manufacture, collection, reuse, repurposing 
      and reprocessing/recycling of plastic items are necessary, overwhelmingly, a curbing 
      in the use of plastic materials in the first place is demanded, particularly from 
      single-use packaging. However, plastic pollution is just one element in the overall 
      matrix of a changing climate ('the world's woes') and must be addressed as part of 
      an integrated consideration of how we use all resources, fossil and otherwise, and 
      the need to change our expectations, goals and lifestyles. In this effort, the role 
      of deglobalisation/relocalisation may prove critical: thus, food and other 
      necessities might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller 
      inputs of fossil fuels for transportation and other purposes, water and fertilisers, 
      along with a marked reduction in the need for plastic packaging.

AB  - Environmental contamination of plastics is becoming an issue of concern globally. 
      Detection of plastics, particularly microplastics, has been increasingly reported in 
      both marine environments and inland waters. Recent work has indicated that soil in 
      terrestrial environments has also been contaminated by plastics. Research has also 
      shown that plastics can have adverse effects on soil biota. However, the impact of 
      plastics on soil physical properties is still unclear. In this work, effects of 
      plastic film of different sizes at environmental relevant concentrations on water 
      evaporation and desiccation cracking in two clay soils were studied. The results 
      showed that the presence of plastics in soil significantly increased the rate of 
      soil water evaporation by creating channels for water movement. The effect was more 
      pronounced in soils treated with 2 mm plastics than in soils treated with 5 and 
      10 mm plastics, and increased with increasing plastic content. Desiccation cracking 
      was observed on the surface of soil treated with 5 and 10 mm plastics likely due to 
      the destruction of soil structural integrity. While 2 mm plastics increased the rate 
      of desiccation shrinkage, the shrinkage ratio was reduced at the residual stage. 
      Results from this work suggest that plastic contamination can alter the water cycle 
      in soils, which may exacerbate soil water shortages and affect the vertical 
      transport of pollutants. Further work is required to study the effects of plastics 
      of other shapes, and laboratory observations should be tested at field scale.

      and recommendations.
PG  - 59-78
LID - 10.1111/nph.13034 [doi]
AB  - There is wide breadth of root function within ecosystems that should be considered 
      when modeling the terrestrial biosphere. Root structure and function are closely 
      associated with control of plant water and nutrient uptake from the soil, plant 
      carbon (C) assimilation, partitioning and release to the soils, and control of 
      biogeochemical cycles through interactions within the rhizosphere. Root function is 
      extremely dynamic and dependent on internal plant signals, root traits and 
      morphology, and the physical, chemical and biotic soil environment. While plant 
      roots have significant structural and functional plasticity to changing 
      environmental conditions, their dynamics are noticeably absent from the land 
      component of process-based Earth system models used to simulate global 
      biogeochemical cycling. Their dynamic representation in large-scale models should 
      improve model veracity. Here, we describe current root inclusion in models across 
      scales, ranging from mechanistic processes of single roots to parameterized root 
      processes operating at the landscape scale. With this foundation we discuss how 
      existing and future root functional knowledge, new data compilation efforts, and 
      novel modeling platforms can be leveraged to enhance root functionality in 
      large-scale terrestrial biosphere models by improving parameterization within 
      models, and introducing new components such as dynamic root distribution and root 
      functional traits linked to resource extraction.

AB  - Microplastics (MP) are receiving increased attention as a harmful environmental 
      pollutant, however information on the reproduction toxicity of MP in terrestrial 
      animals, especially mammals, is limited. In this experiment, we investigated the 
      impact of polystyrene microplastics (micro-PS) on the reproductive system of male 
      mice. Healthy Balb/c mice were exposed to saline or to different doses of micro-PS 
      for 6 weeks. The results showed that micro-PS exposure resulted in a significant 
      decrease in the number and motility of sperm, and a significant increase in sperm 
      deformity rate. We also detected a decrease in the activity of the sperm 
      metabolism-related enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH), and a decrease in the serum testosterone content in the micro-PS exposure 
      group. We found that micro-PS exposure caused oxidative stress and activated JNK and 
      p38 MAPK. In addition, we found that when N-acetylcysteine (NAC) scavenges ROS, and 
      when the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 inhibits p38MAPK, the micro-PS-induced 
      sperm damage is alleviated and testosterone secretion improves. In conclusion, our 
      findings suggest that micro-PS induces reproductive toxicity in mice through 
      oxidative stress and activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathways.

TI  - Phenotypic Plasticity in the Structure of Fine Adventitious Metasequoia 
      glyptostroboides Roots Allows Adaptation to Aquatic and Terrestrial Environments.
LID - 10.3390/plants8110501 [doi]
LID - 501
AB  - Metasequoia glyptostroboides (Cupressaceae) is a rare deciduous conifer which grows 
      successfully in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. This tree has a narrow 
      natural distribution in central China but is cultivated worldwide. Using 
      histochemical staining and microscopy (both brightfield and epifluorescent), we 
      investigated whether the phenotypic anatomical and histochemical plasticity in the 
      fine adventitious roots of M. glyptostroboides has promoted the adaptation of this 
      plant to aquatic and terrestrial environments. The fine root development and cortex 
      sloughing of M. glyptostroboides occurs later in aquatic habitats than in 
      terrestrial habitats. Anatomical and histochemical analyses have revealed that the 
      apoplastic barriers in the primary growth of the fine roots consist of the 
      endodermis and exodermis with Casparian bands, suberin lamellae, and secondarily 
      lignified cell walls. There were also lignified phi (Φ) thickenings in the cortex. 
      In both aquatic and terrestrial roots, secondary growth was observed in the vascular 
      cambium, which produced secondary xylem and phloem, as well as in the phellogen, 
      which produced cork. As compared to terrestrial adventitious roots, aquatic 
      adventitious roots had multiple lignified Φ thickenings throughout the cortex, 
      larger air spaces, dilated parenchyma, and dense suberin and lignin depositions in 
      the exodermis. Our results thus indicate that phenotypic plasticity in the 
      anatomical features of the fine adventitious roots, including apoplastic barriers, 
      air spaces, and lignified Φ thickenings, might support the adaptation of M. 
      glyptostroboides to both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

AB  - The impacts of nano- and microplastics (<100 nm and <5 mm, respectively) on 
      terrestrial systems is to the present largely unexplored. Plastic particles are 
      likely to accumulate in these systems primarily by the application of sewage sludge. 
      The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of three sizes of 
      plastic particles (50, 500, and 4800 nm) on a terrestrial plant (cress; Lepidium 
      sativum), using a standardized 72 h bioassay. Cress seeds were exposed to five 
      different concentrations of plastics, ranging from 10(3) to 10(7) particles mL(-1). 
      Germination rate was significantly reduced after 8 h of exposure for all three sizes 
      of plastics, with increased adverse effect with increasing plastic sizes. Seeds 
      exposed to 4800 nm microplastics showed a germination rate decline from 78% in 
      control to 17% in the highest exposure. No difference in germination rate occurred 
      after 24 h of exposure, regardless of the size of the plastic used. Significant 
      differences in root growth were observed after 24 h, but not after 48 or 72 h of 
      exposure. Impacts on germination are likely due to physical blockage of the pores in 
      the seed capsule by microplastics as shown by confocal microscopy of fluorescent 
      microplastics. In later stages, the microplastics particularly accumulated on the 
      root hairs. This is the first detailed study on the effect of nano- and 
      microplastics on a vascular, terrestrial plant, and our results indicate short-term 
      and transient adverse effects.

PG  - 56-67

AB  - To forecast the responses of species to future climate change, an understanding of 
      the ability of species to adapt to long-term shifts in temperature is crucial. We 
      present a review on evolutionary adaptation and phenotypic plasticity of 
      temperature-related traits in terrestrial invertebrates. The evidence for adaptive 
      evolution in melanization is good, but we caution that genetic determination needs 
      to be tested in each individual species, and complex genetic correlations may exist. 
      For phenological traits allochronic data sets provide powerful means to track 
      climate-induced changes; however, rarely are responses deconstructed into 
      evolutionary and plastic responses. Laboratory studies suggest climate change 
      responses in these traits will be driven by both. For stress resistance, the 
      evidence for shifts in traits is poor. Studies leaning heavily on Drosophila have 
      demonstrated potential limits to evolutionary responses in desiccation and heat 
      resistance. Quantifying the capacity for these species to respond plastically and 
      extending this work to other taxa will be an important next step. We also note that, 
      although not strictly speaking a species trait, the response of endosymbionts to 
      heat stress requires further study. Finally, while clearly genetic, and possibly 
      adaptive, the anonymous nature of latitudinal shifts in clines of genetic markers in 
      Drosophila prevents further interpretation.

AB  - Micro- and nano-plastics have widely been recognized as major global environmental 
      problem due to its widespread use and inadequate waste management. The emergence of 
      these plastic pollutants in agroecosystem is a legitimate ecotoxicological concerns 
      for food web exchanges. In agriculture, micro/nano plastics are originated from a 
      variety of different agricultural management practices, such as the use of compost, 
      sewage sludge and mulching. A range of soil properties and plant traits are affected 
      by their presence. With the increase of plastic debris, these pollutant materials 
      have now begun to demonstrate serious implications for key soil ecosystem functions, 
      such as soil microbial activity and nutrient cycling. Nitrogen (N) cycle is key 
      predictor of ecological stability and management in terrestrial ecosystem. In this 
      review, we evaluate ecological risks associated with micro-nano plastic for 
      soil-plant system. We also discuss the consequence of plastic pollutants, either 
      positive or negative, on soil microbial activities. In addition, we systematically 
      summarize both direct and hypothesized implications for N cycling in agroecosystem. 
      We conclude that soil N transformation had showed varied effects resulting from 
      different types and sizes of plastic polymers present in soil. While mixed effects 
      of microplastic pollution on plant growth and yield have been observed, 
      biodegradable plastics have appeared to pose greater risk for plant growth compared 
      to chemical plastic polymers.

TI  - Using a marine microalga as a chassis for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
      degradation.
PG  - 171

AB  - BACKGROUND: The biological degradation of plastics is a promising method to counter 
      the increasing pollution of our planet with artificial polymers and to develop 
      eco-friendly recycling strategies. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermoplast 
      industrially produced from fossil feedstocks since the 1940s, nowadays prevalently 
      used in bottle packaging and textiles. Although established industrial processes for 
      PET recycling exist, large amounts of PET still end up in the environment-a 
      significant portion thereof in the world's oceans. In 2016, Ideonella sakaiensis, a 
      bacterium possessing the ability to degrade PET and use the degradation products as 
      a sole carbon source for growth, was isolated. I. sakaiensis expresses a key enzyme 
      responsible for the breakdown of PET into monomers: PETase. This hydrolase might 
      possess huge potential for the development of biological PET degradation and 
      recycling processes as well as bioremediation approaches of environmental plastic 
      waste. RESULTS: Using the photosynthetic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a 
      chassis we generated a microbial cell factory capable of producing and secreting an 
      engineered version of PETase into the surrounding culture medium. Initial 
      degradation experiments using culture supernatant at 30 °C showed that PETase 
      possessed activity against PET and the copolymer polyethylene terephthalate glycol 
      (PETG) with an approximately 80-fold higher turnover of low crystallinity PETG 
      compared to bottle PET. Moreover, we show that diatom produced PETase was active 
      against industrially shredded PET in a saltwater-based environment even at 
      mesophilic temperatures (21 °C). The products resulting from the degradation of the 
      PET substrate were mainly terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) 
      terephthalic acid (MHET) estimated to be formed in the micromolar range under the 
      selected reaction conditions. CONCLUSION: We provide a promising and eco-friendly 
      solution for biological decomposition of PET waste in a saltwater-based environment 
      by using a eukaryotic microalga instead of a bacterium as a model system. Our 
      results show that via synthetic biology the diatom P. tricornutum indeed could be 
      converted into a valuable chassis for biological PET degradation. Overall, this 
      proof of principle study demonstrates the potential of the diatom system for future 
      biotechnological applications in biological PET degradation especially for 
      bioremediation approaches of PET polluted seawater.

AB  - Plastics debris in the marine environment, including resin pellets, fragments and 
      microscopic plastic fragments, contain organic contaminants, including 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum 
      hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides 
      (2,2'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane, hexachlorinated hexanes), 
      polybrominated diphenylethers, alkylphenols and bisphenol A, at concentrations from 
      sub ng g(-1) to microg g(-1). Some of these compounds are added during plastics 
      manufacture, while others adsorb from the surrounding seawater. Concentrations of 
      hydrophobic contaminants adsorbed on plastics showed distinct spatial variations 
      reflecting global pollution patterns. Model calculations and experimental 
      observations consistently show that polyethylene accumulates more organic 
      contaminants than other plastics such as polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride. Both 
      a mathematical model using equilibrium partitioning and experimental data have 
      demonstrated the transfer of contaminants from plastic to organisms. A feeding 
      experiment indicated that PCBs could transfer from contaminated plastics to streaked 
      shearwater chicks. Plasticizers, other plastics additives and constitutional 
      monomers also present potential threats in terrestrial environments because they can 
      leach from waste disposal sites into groundwater and/or surface waters. Leaching and 
      degradation of plasticizers and polymers are complex phenomena dependent on 
      environmental conditions in the landfill and the chemical properties of each 
      additive. Bisphenol A concentrations in leachates from municipal waste disposal 
      sites in tropical Asia ranged from sub microg l(-1) to mg l(-1) and were correlated 
      with the level of economic development.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity in resource availability affects invasive plant 
      reproductive strategies and resource allocation to reproduction. Here, we conducted 
      two field surveys to examine the effect of wetland and terrestrial habitats on 
      inflorescence production and resource allocation to inflorescence of the amphibious 
      invasive plant Alternanthera philoxeroides in its invasive range (China). We also 
      specifically examined the effects of water availability, fertilizer application, and 
      plant density (space) in a greenhouse experiment. In field surveys, inflorescence 
      biomass, normal monoclinous flowers and ratio of inflorescences to shoots of plants 
      from wetlands were about 2.4-, 0.8- and 1.3-fold higher than those from terrestrial 
      habitats, respectively. In greenhouse experiment, plants with higher fertilizer 
      application and lower competition conditions produced more inflorescences, and had a 
      lower ratio of roots to shoots and a comparable ratio of inflorescences to shoot and 
      root. Furthermore, water availability had a significant interactive effect when 
      combined with fertilizer level or plant density on inflorescence production and 
      resource allocation. Together, our results indicate that high resources, such as 
      those found in wetland habitats, favor both vegetative growth and sexual trait in A. 
      philoxeroides. However, in terrestrial habitats where resources are relatively poor, 
      the invader can adapt to the environment by allocating more resources to vegetative 
      growth for clonal reproduction and less resources for sexual trait. This phenotypic 
      plasticity in resource allocation likely facilitates the plant to invade 
      heterogeneous wetlands and terrestrial environments.

AB  - Nitrogen deposition will affect the morphology of fine roots and its absorption of 
      nutrien-ts, resulting in changes nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. In 
      order to understand the effects of nitrogen deposition on fine root morphological 
      traits of Castanopsis fabri and C. carlesii, two ectomycorrhizas tree species, we 
      carried out in situ experiment using the root bags method in an evergreen 
      broadleaved forest in the subtropical zone. The results showed that the plastic 
      responses of specific root length and specific root surface area of low-order roots 
      (first to third order) to nitrogen addition was higher than that of high-order roots 
      (fourth order). The plastic responses of root tissue density to nitrogen addition 
      increased from the first-order to the fourth-order, while the average root diameter 
      of each order had no significant plastic responses to nitrogen addition. There was a 
      certain synergistic change between the plastic response of specific root length and 
      specific surface area in the low order fine root and the plastic response of tissue 
      density in the high order fine root. The specific root length, specific root surface 
      area and root tissue density of the two species showed opposite plastic responses to 
      nitrogen addition, indicating that different ectomycorrhizal tree species had 
      different nutrient foraging strategies. C. fabri adopted rapid absorption strategy 
      by increasing specific root length, specific root surface area, and proliferation 
      rate of fine root length, while C. carlesii adopted a relatively conservative 
      resource absorption strategy by increasing tissue density of fine roots.

TI  - A catchment-scale perspective of plastic pollution.
PG  - 1207-21
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14572 [doi]
AB  - Plastic pollution is distributed across the globe, but compared with marine 
      environments, there is only rudimentary understanding of the distribution and 
      effects of plastics in other ecosystems. Here, we review the transport and effects 
      of plastics across terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. We focus on 
      hydrological catchments as well-defined landscape units that provide an integrating 
      scale at which plastic pollution can be investigated and managed. Diverse processes 
      are responsible for the observed ubiquity of plastic pollution, but sources, fluxes 
      and sinks in river catchments are poorly quantified. Early indications are that 
      rivers are hotspots of plastic pollution, supporting some of the highest recorded 
      concentrations. River systems are also likely pivotal conduits for plastic transport 
      among the terrestrial, floodplain, riparian, benthic and transitional ecosystems 
      with which they connect. Although ecological effects of micro- and nanoplastics 
      might arise through a variety of physical and chemical mechanisms, consensus and 
      understanding of their nature, severity and scale are restricted. Furthermore, while 
      individual-level effects are often graphically represented in public media, 
      knowledge of the extent and severity of the impacts of plastic at population, 
      community and ecosystem levels is limited. Given the potential social, ecological 
      and economic consequences, we call for more comprehensive investigations of plastic 
      pollution in ecosystems to guide effective management action and risk assessment. 
      This is reliant on (a) expanding research to quantify sources, sinks, fluxes and 
      fates of plastics in catchments and transitional waters both independently as a 
      major transport routes to marine ecosystems, (b) improving environmentally relevant 
      dose-response relationships for different organisms and effect pathways, (c) scaling 
      up from studies on individual organisms to populations and ecosystems, where 
      individual effects are shown to cause harm and; (d) improving biomonitoring through 
      developing ecologically relevant metrics based on contemporary plastic research.

AB  - In recent years, increasing global attention has focused on "microplastics" (MPs) 
      and "nanoplastics" (NPs) resulting in many studies on the effects of these compounds 
      on ecological and environmental aspects. These tiny particles (<5000 µm), 
      predominantly derived from the degradation of plastics, pollute the marine and 
      terrestrial ecosystems with the ability to enter into the food chain. In this 
      manner, human consumption of food contaminated with MPs or NPs is unavoidable, but 
      the related consequences remain to be determined. The aim of this review is to 
      complement previous reviews on this topic by providing new studies related to 
      exposure, absorption, and toxicity in mammalian in vivo and in vitro systems. With 
      respect to novel information, gaps and limitations hindering attainment of firm 
      conclusions as well as preparation of a reliable risk assessment are identified. 
      Subsequently, recommendations for in vivo and in vitro testing methods are presented 
      in order to perform further relevant and targeted research studies.

TI  - Microplastics in the aquatic and terrestrial environment: sources (with a specific 
      focus on personal care products), fate and effects.

AB  - Due to the widespread use and durability of synthetic polymers, plastic debris 
      occurs in the environment worldwide. In the present work, information on sources and 
      fate of microplastic particles in the aquatic and terrestrial environment, and on 
      their uptake and effects, mainly in aquatic organisms, is reviewed. Microplastics in 
      the environment originate from a variety of sources. Quantitative information on the 
      relevance of these sources is generally lacking, but first estimates indicate that 
      abrasion and fragmentation of larger plastic items and materials containing 
      synthetic polymers are likely to be most relevant. Microplastics are ingested and, 
      mostly, excreted rapidly by numerous aquatic organisms. So far, there is no clear 
      evidence of bioaccumulation or biomagnification. In laboratory studies, the 
      ingestion of large amounts of microplastics mainly led to a lower food uptake and, 
      consequently, reduced energy reserves and effects on other physiological functions. 
      Based on the evaluated data, the lowest microplastic concentrations affecting marine 
      organisms exposed via water are much higher than levels measured in marine water. In 
      lugworms exposed via sediment, effects were observed at microplastic levels that 
      were higher than those in subtidal sediments but in the same range as maximum levels 
      in beach sediments. Hydrophobic contaminants are enriched on microplastics, but the 
      available experimental results and modelling approaches indicate that the transfer 
      of sorbed pollutants by microplastics is not likely to contribute significantly to 
      bioaccumulation of these pollutants. Prior to being able to comprehensively assess 
      possible environmental risks caused by microplastics a number of knowledge gaps need 
      to be filled. However, in view of the persistence of microplastics in the 
      environment, the high concentrations measured at some environmental sites and the 
      prospective of strongly increasing concentrations, the release of plastics into the 
      environment should be reduced in a broad and global effort regardless of a proof of 
      an environmental risk.

AB  - Plastic pollution is one of the major challenges in the Anthropocene. A plastic 
      waste sub-product, microplastics (<5 mm), has been regarded as contaminants of 
      concern for its detrimental effects and widespread in the environment. Most studies 
      assessing microplastics focused on marine environments, while terrestrial and soil 
      systems have been overlooked. In this review, we analyzed the current knowledge 
      regarding microplastic pollution in natural soil or agricultural ecosystems. We 
      focused on reviewing the procedural steps for microplastic extraction and 
      identification in detail. The heterogeneity of the methods applied, lack of 
      standardized procedures and incompatible parameters reported, make the results 
      incomparable among most studies. Several microplastic concentration units are needed 
      to make studies comparable. Correctly determining and reporting microplastic 
      morphotypes are key to understanding the sources of contamination. Minimal 
      considerations and recommendations were stated for extraction, digestion, 
      filtration, and polymer identification procedures. Baseline contamination prevention 
      measures were identified as mandatory along the entire sampling, handling and 
      identification procedures. Lastly, knowledge gaps were identified and discussed for 
      further research.

AB  - Marine plastic debris is well characterized in terms of its ability to negatively 
      impact terrestrial and marine environments, endanger coastal wildlife, and interfere 
      with navigation, tourism and commercial fisheries. However, the impacts of 
      potentially harmful microorganisms and pathogens colonising plastic litter are not 
      well understood. The hard surface of plastics provides an ideal environment for 
      opportunistic microbial colonisers to form biofilms and might offer a protective 
      niche capable of supporting a diversity of different microorganisms, known as the 
      "Plastisphere". This biotope could act as an important vector for the persistence 
      and spread of pathogens, faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) and harmful algal bloom 
      species (HABs) across beach and bathing environments. This review will focus on the 
      existent knowledge and research gaps, and identify the possible consequences of 
      plastic-associated microbes on human health, the spread of infectious diseases and 
      bathing water quality.

AB  - Industrial progress has brought us an important polymer material, i.e. plastic. 
      Because of mass production and use, and improper management and disposal, plastic 
      pollution has become one of the most pivotal environmental issues in the world 
      today. However, the current researches on microplastics/nanoplastics are mainly 
      focused on individual aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric environments, ignoring 
      the fact that the natural environment is a whole. In this regard, the transport of 
      microplastics/nanoplastics among the three environment compartments, including 
      reciprocal contributions and inherent connections, and the impact of 
      microplastics/nanoplastics on organisms living in multiple environments are research 
      problems that we pay special attention to. Furthermore, this paper comprehensively 
      reviews the transport and distribution of microplastics/nanoplastics in individual 
      compartments and the toxicity of organisms, either alone or in combination with 
      other pollutants. The properties of microplastics/nanoplastics, environment 
      condition and the growth habit of organisms are critical to the transport, 
      distribution and toxicity of microplastics/nanoplastics. These knowledge gaps need 
      to be addressed urgently to improve cognition of the degree of plastic pollution and 
      enhance our ability to deal with pollution. Meanwhile, it is hoped that the paper 
      can provide a relatively complete theoretical knowledge system and multiple "leads" 
      for future innovative ideas in this field.

TI  - Characteristics of Plastic Pollution in the Environment: A Review.
LID - 10.1007/s00128-020-02820-1 [doi]
AB  - Plastics are ubiquitous in the environment and have become a hot topic in academic 
      circles. Extensive studies have focused on analytical methods, source, abundance, 
      transport, fate, degradation of plastics in the environment and threats to natural 
      surroundings, wildlife or even human health. However, characteristics of plastic 
      pollution, which are critical to understand this emerging problem, remain unknown up 
      to now. Here, this paper reviews the major characteristics of plastic pollution in 
      the environment to enhance present understanding of this issue. These 
      characteristics, including diversity, persistence, global issues, combined pollution 
      and threats to organisms and human health, are critically summarized in this work. 
      Further, "plastic cycle" in the environment, namely, aquatic, atmospheric, and 
      terrestrial system, is also discussed in this review. Finally, we highlight current 
      challenges of plastic pollution posed to the public and also recommend the research 
      trends in future work.

AB  - Phthalates are being increasingly used as softeners-plasticizers to improve the 
      plasticity and the flexibility of materials. Amongst the different plasticizers 
      used, more attention is paid to di (2-ethylhexylphtalate) (DEHP), one of the most 
      representative compounds as it exhibits predominant effects on environment and human 
      health. Meanwhile, several questions related to its sources; toxicity, distribution 
      and fate still remain unanswered. Most of the evidence until date suggests that DEHP 
      is an omnipresent compound found in different ecological compartments and its higher 
      hydrophobicity and low volatility have resulted in significant adsorption to solids 
      matrix. In fact, there are important issues to be addressed with regard to the 
      toxicity of this compound in both animals and humans, its behavior in different 
      ecological systems, and the transformation products generated during different 
      biological or advanced chemical treatments. This article presents detailed review of 
      existing treatment schemes, research gaps and future trends related to DEHP.

AB  - Although plastic pollution happens globally, the micro- (<5 mm) and macroplastic 
      (5-150 mm) transfer of plastic to terrestrial species relevant to human consumption 
      has not been examined. We provide first-time evidence for micro- and macroplastic 
      transfer from soil to chickens in traditional Mayan home gardens in Southeast Mexico 
      where waste mismanagement is common. We assessed micro- and macroplastic in soil, 
      earthworm casts, chicken feces, crops and gizzards (used for human consumption). 
      Microplastic concentrations increased from soil (0.87 ± 1.9 particles g(-1)), to 
      earthworm casts (14.8 ± 28.8 particles g(-1)), to chicken feces (129.8 ± 82.3 
      particles g(-1)). Chicken gizzards contained 10.2 ± 13.8 microplastic particles, 
      while no microplastic was found in crops. An average of 45.82 ± 42.6 macroplastic 
      particles were found per gizzard and 11 ± 15.3 macroplastic particles per crop, with 
      1-10 mm particles being significantly more abundant per gizzard (31.8 ± 27.27 
      particles) compared to the crop (1 ± 2.2 particles). The data show that micro- and 
      macroplastic are capable of entering terrestrial food webs.

AB  - As plastic pollution in the environment has increased rapidly in the last half 
      century, so too has the study of the effects of plastic on marine, aquatic and 
      terrestrial ecosystems. From this research, a series of new terms has emerged to 
      describe the phenomena unique to the presence of plastic-based materials in nature. 
      In this short note, we bring together disparate neologisms into a single lexicon 
      with the aim to encourage use of a unified vocabulary to describe the new reality of 
      ecological, chemical, and geological systems in the age of plastics.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the occurrence of microplastic fibers (MFs) in soil 
      environments. To determine whether MFs are harmful for soil biota, we evaluated 
      toxic effects on terrestrial snails (Achatina fulica) after 28 d exposure to 
      polyethylene terephthalate MFs at concentrations of 0.01-0.71 g kg(-1) (dry soil 
      weight). Digestion kinetics experiments on 24 snails showed that MFs can be ingested 
      and excreted within 48 h. We found the appearance of cracks and deterioration on the 
      surface of MFs after depuration by the digestive system. Prolonged exposure to 40 
      snails showed that 0.14-0.71 g kg(-1) MFs caused an average reduction of 24.7-34.9% 
      food intake and 46.6-69.7% excretion. 0.71 g kg(-1) MFs induced significant villi 
      damage in the gastrointestinal walls of 40% snails, but did not influence the 
      histology of the liver and kidney. Moreover, 0.71 g kg(-1) MFs exposure reduced 
      glutathione peroxidase (59.3 ± 13.8%) and total antioxidant capacity (36.7 ± 8.5%), 
      but elevated malondialdehyde level (58.0 ± 6.4%) in the liver, which indicates 
      oxidative stress is involved in the toxic mechanism. Our results suggest that MFs 
      have adverse impacts on the fitness of soil organisms, and highlight the ecological 
      risks of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Evaluating scenarios toward zero plastic pollution.

LID - 10.1126/science.aba9475 [doi]
AB  - Plastic pollution is a pervasive and growing problem. To estimate the effectiveness 
      of interventions to reduce plastic pollution, we modeled stocks and flows of 
      municipal solid waste and four sources of microplastics through the global plastic 
      system for five scenarios between 2016 and 2040. Implementing all feasible 
      interventions reduced plastic pollution by 40% from 2016 rates and 78% relative to 
      "business as usual" in 2040. Even with immediate and concerted action, 710 million 
      metric tons of plastic waste cumulatively entered aquatic and terrestrial 
      ecosystems. To avoid a massive build-up of plastic in the environment, coordinated 
      global action is urgently needed to reduce plastic consumption; increase rates of 
      reuse, waste collection, and recycling; expand safe disposal systems; and accelerate 
      innovation in the plastic value chain.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants are known to release microplastics that have been 
      detected in aquatic and terrestrial organisms constituting part of the human diet. 
      Chlorination of wastewater-borne microplastics was hypothesized to induce chemical 
      and physical changes detectable by Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning 
      calorimetry (DSC). In the laboratory, virgin plastics (∼0.05 × 2 × 2 mm) were 
      exposed to differing sterilization conditions representative of dosages used in the 
      disinfection of drinking water, wastewater, and heavily contaminated surfaces. 
      Polypropylene (PP) was most resistant to chlorination, followed by high density 
      polyethylene (HDPE) and polystyrene (PS). Polystyrene showed degradation, indicated 
      by changes in Raman peak widths, at concentration-time regimes (CT values) as low as 
      75 mg min/L, whereas HDPE and PP remained unaltered even at chlorine doses 
      characteristic of wastewater disinfection (150 mg min/L). However, HDPE and PS were 
      not completely resistant to oxidative attack by chlorination. Under extremely harsh 
      conditions, shifts in Raman peaks and the formation of new bonds were observed. 
      These results show that plastics commonly used in consumer products can be 
      chemically altered, some even under conditions prevailing during wastewater 
      treatment. Changes in polymer properties, observed for HDPE and PP under extreme 
      exposure conditions only, are predicted to alter the risk microplastics pose to 
      aquatic and terrestrial biota, since an increase in carbon-chlorine (C-Cl) bonds is 
      known to increase toxicity, rendering the polymers more hydrophobic and thus more 
      prone to adsorb, accumulate, and transport harmful persistent pollutants to biota in 
      both aquatic and terrestrial environments.

TI  - Butyltin residues in livers of humans and wild terrestrial mammals and in plastic 
      products.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - Butyltin compounds (BTs) including mono-(MBT), di-(DBT) and tributyltin (TBT) were 
      determined in livers of humans and wild terrestrial mammals, such as raccoon dogs 
      (Nyctereutes procyonoids) and monkeys (Macaca fuscata) from Japan. In addition, 22 
      samples of plastic products were analyzed. BT residues were detected in all the 
      liver samples of humans and raccoon dogs, with concentrations of <360 ng/g wet wt, 
      whereas concentrations in the liver of monkeys were either less than the detection 
      limit or were only in trace levels. Elevated concentrations of BTs, particularly DBT 
      (<140,000 ng/g) and MBT (<130,000 ng/g), were found in some plastic products, such 
      as baking parchments made from siliconized paper and gloves made up from 
      polyurethane. The results of a cooking test using the above baking parchment 
      indicated the transfer of BTs to foodstuffs. These observations suggest expansion of 
      BT contamination among terrestrial mammals. BT pollution from industrial appliances, 
      such as plastic stabilizers and catalysts other than those of marine origin as 
      antifouling agents, are suggested as alternative sources of exposure.

TI  - Plastic pollution in croplands threatens long-term food security.
PG  - 3356-3367
LID - 10.1111/gcb.15043 [doi]
AB  - Plastic pollution is a global concern given its prevalence in aquatic and 
      terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have been conducted on the distribution and impact 
      of plastic pollution in marine ecosystems, but little is known on terrestrial 
      ecosystems. Plastic mulch has been widely used to increase crop yields worldwide, 
      yet the impact of plastic residues in cropland soils to soil health and crop 
      production in the long term remained unclear. In this paper, using a global 
      meta-analysis, we found that the use of plastic mulch can indeed increase crop 
      yields on average by 25%-42% in the immediate season due to the increase of soil 
      temperature (+8%) and moisture (+17%). However, the unabated accumulation of film 
      residues in the field negatively impacts its physicochemical properties linked to 
      healthy soil and threatens food production in the long term. It has multiple 
      negative impacts on plant growth including crop yield (at the mean rate of -3% for 
      every additional 100 kg/ha of film residue), plant height (-2%) and root weight 
      (-5%), and soil properties including soil water evaporation capacity (-2%), soil 
      water infiltration rate (-8%), soil organic matter (-0.8%) and soil available 
      phosphorus (-5%) based on meta-regression. Using a nationwide field survey of China, 
      the largest user of plastic mulch worldwide, we found that plastic residue 
      accumulation in cropland soils has reached 550,800 tonnes, with an estimated 6%-10% 
      reduction in cotton yield in some polluted sites based on current level of plastic 
      residue content. Immediate actions should be taken to ensure the recovery of plastic 
      film mulch and limit further increase in film residue loading to maintain the 
      sustainability of these croplands.

AB  - Air-breathing and amphibious fishes are essential study organisms to shed insight 
      into the required physiological shifts that supported the full transition from 
      aquatic water-breathing fishes to terrestrial air-breathing tetrapods. While the 
      origin of air-breathing in the evolutionary history of the tetrapods has received 
      considerable focus, much less is known about the evolutionary physiology of 
      air-breathing among fishes. This review summarizes recent advances within the field 
      with specific emphasis on the cardiorespiratory regulation associated with 
      air-breathing and terrestrial excursions, and how respiratory physiology of these 
      living transitional forms are affected by development and personality. Finally, we 
      provide a detailed and re-evaluated model of the evolution of air-breathing among 
      fishes that serves as a framework for addressing new questions on the 
      cardiorespiratory changes associated with it. This review highlights the importance 
      of combining detailed studies on piscine air-breathing model species with 
      comparative multi-species studies, to add an additional dimension to our 
      understanding of the evolutionary physiology of air-breathing in vertebrates.

AB  - Understanding how natural populations will respond to rapid anthropogenic climate 
      change is one of the greatest challenges for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. 
      Much research has focussed on whether physiological traits can evolve quickly enough 
      under rapidly increasing temperatures. While the simple Breeder's equation helps to 
      understand how extreme temperatures and genetic variation might drive 
      within-population evolution under climate change, it does not consider two key 
      areas: how different forms of phenotypic plasticity interact and variation among 
      populations. Plasticity can modify the exposure to climatic extremes and the 
      strength of selection from those extremes, while differences among populations 
      provide adaptive diversity not apparent within them. Here, we focus on terrestrial 
      vertebrates and, with a case study on a tropical lizard, demonstrate the complex 
      interplay between spatial, genetic and plastic contributions to variation in 
      climate-relevant physiological traits. We identify several problems that need to be 
      better understood: which traits are under selection in a changing climate; the 
      different forms of plasticity relevant to population persistence and rapid 
      evolution; plastic versus genetic contributions to geographic variation in 
      climate-associated traits and whether plasticity can be harnessed to promote 
      persistence of species. Given ongoing uncertainties around whether natural 
      populations can evolve rapidly enough to persist, we advocate the use of field 
      trials aimed at increasing rates of adaptation, especially in systems known to be 
      strongly impacted by human-driven changes in climate.

TI  - Differentially charged nanoplastics demonstrate distinct accumulation in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana.
PG  - 755-760
LID - 10.1038/s41565-020-0707-4 [doi]
AB  - Although the fates of microplastics (0.1-5 mm in size) and nanoplastics (<100 nm) in 
      marine environments are being increasingly well studied(1,2), little is known about 
      the behaviour of nanoplastics in terrestrial environments(3-6), especially 
      agricultural soils(7). Previous studies have evaluated the consequences of 
      nanoplastic accumulation in aquatic plants, but there is no direct evidence for the 
      internalization of nanoplastics in terrestrial plants. Here, we show that both 
      positively and negatively charged nanoplastics can accumulate in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana. The aggregation promoted by the growth medium and root exudates limited 
      the uptake of amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics with positive surface charges. 
      Thus, positively charged nanoplastics accumulated at relatively low levels in the 
      root tips, but these nanoplastics induced a higher accumulation of reactive oxygen 
      species and inhibited plant growth and seedling development more strongly than 
      negatively charged sulfonic-acid-modified nanoplastics. By contrast, the negatively 
      charged nanoplastics were observed frequently in the apoplast and xylem. Our 
      findings provide direct evidence that nanoplastics can accumulate in plants, 
      depending on their surface charge. Plant accumulation of nanoplastics can have both 
      direct ecological effects and implications for agricultural sustainability and food 
      safety.

AB  - Microplastic pollution is a major global environmental problem in both aquatic and 
      terrestrial environments. Pesticides are frequently applied to agricultural soil to 
      reduce the effects of pests on crops, but may also affect the degradation of 
      plastics. In this study, we generated microplastics from polyethylene (PE) film and 
      biodegradable poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) film and determined (1) 
      the effect of prothioconazole on degradation of the microplastics, and (2) the 
      adsorption and release characteristics of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Ba, and Sn) 
      by the microplastics during degradation process. Changes of surface functional 
      groups and morphologies were measured by FTIR and SEM, while metal concentrations 
      were determined by ICPMS. Prothioconazole was found to promote plastic degradation. 
      PBAT degraded faster and adsorbed more heavy metals from the soil than PE. Whether 
      the microplastics adsorb or release heavy metals depended on the metal and their 
      concentrations. Prothioconazole inhibited the adsorption of Cr, As, Pb and Ba by 
      microplastics, promoted the adsorption of Cu, and had no significant effect for Sn. 
      These results can help to assess the ecological risk of microplastic pollution from 
      plastic mulch when combined with heavy metals.

AB  - Increase in plastic pollution causes irreparable harm to the environment lasting for 
      decades. While current data of plastic pollution include marine and terrestrial 
      ecology, the impacts of degraded or intentionally produced microscopic-sized 
      plastics on human health remain unknown. Here, we are proposing the usage of 
      pluripotent stem cells, modern transcriptomics, and bioinformatics as a unique 
      scientific tool to define the link between environmental and intracellular 
      pollution, its outcome on early human development and origin of diseases. This 
      commentary is an urgent appeal to the scientific and policy communities to invest 
      more time and resources to establish reliable standards and methods to define and 
      address the consequences of plastic pollution on human health.

AB  - Plastic contamination is an increasing environmental problem in marine systems where 
      it has spread globally to even the most remote habitats. Plastic pieces in smaller 
      size scales, microplastics (particles <5 mm), have reached high densities (e.g., 
      100,000 items per m(3)) in waters and sediments, and are interacting with organisms 
      and the environment in a variety of ways. Early investigations of freshwater systems 
      suggest microplastic presence and interactions are equally as far reaching as are 
      being observed in marine systems. Microplastics are being detected in freshwaters of 
      Europe, North America, and Asia, and the first organismal studies are finding that 
      freshwater fauna across a range of feeding guilds ingest microplastics. Drawing from 
      the marine literature and these initial freshwater studies, we review the issue of 
      microplastics in freshwater systems to summarise current understanding, identify 
      knowledge gaps and suggest future research priorities. Evidence suggests that 
      freshwater systems may share similarities to marine systems in the types of forces 
      that transport microplastics (e.g. surface currents); the prevalence of 
      microplastics (e.g. numerically abundant and ubiquitous); the approaches used for 
      detection, identification and quantification (e.g. density separation, filtration, 
      sieving and infrared spectroscopy); and the potential impacts (e.g. physical damage 
      to organisms that ingest them, chemical transfer of toxicants). Differences between 
      freshwater and marine systems include the closer proximity to point sources in 
      freshwaters, the typically smaller sizes of freshwater systems, and spatial and 
      temporal differences in the mixing/transport of particles by physical forces. These 
      differences between marine and freshwater systems may lead to differences in the 
      type of microplastics present. For example, rivers may show a predictable pattern in 
      microplastic characteristics (size, shape, relative abundance) based on waste 
      sources (e.g. household vs. industrial) adjacent to the river, and distance 
      downstream from a point source. Given that the study of microplastics in freshwaters 
      has only arisen in the last few years, we are still limited in our understanding of 
      1) their presence and distribution in the environment; 2) their transport pathways 
      and factors that affect distributions; 3) methods for their accurate detection and 
      quantification; 4) the extent and relevance of their impacts on aquatic life. We 
      also do not know how microplastics might transfer from freshwater to terrestrial 
      ecosystems, and we do not know if and how they may affect human health. This is 
      concerning because human populations have a high dependency on freshwaters for 
      drinking water and for food resources. Increasing the level of understanding in 
      these areas is essential if we are to develop appropriate policy and management 
      tools to address this emerging issue.

AB  - The ever-increasing use of domestic washing machine by urban population is playing a 
      major role in synthetic microfibers (SMFs) pollution via entering the ecosystem. 
      Although many of the sources of fragmented plastic pollution in oceanic environments 
      have been well known, urban areas are playing a major contributor due to huge 
      populations. Thousands of scientific investigations are now reporting the adverse 
      effect of these micro pollutants on aquatic and terrestrial environment, food chain 
      and human health. Microfiber particles along with washing machine grey waters are 
      emitted into urban drainage adjoining the lakes and river which ultimately mix in 
      ocean water and after emission these tiny particles dispersed though out the ocean 
      water by currents due to their low density. Environmental pollution cause by 
      domestic laundering processes of synthetic clothes has been reported as the major 
      cause of primary microplastics in the marine system. While community awareness and 
      improved education will be successful in making public conscious of this problem, 
      there needs to be more research on global scale to mitigate the ecological 
      consequences of microfiber pollution by urban habitats through environmental 
      friendly approach. This paper focuses to improve the understanding of urban 
      population influence on microfiber pollution, their ecological toxicity to aquatic 
      organism and humans, detection and characterization techniques with an emphasis on 
      future research for prevention and control of microfiber pollution.

AB  - Plastic debris exists worldwide and research on microplastic pollution has gradually 
      spread from the oceans to freshwater and terrestrial systems. Coral reefs not only 
      serve as one of the most charismatic and biodiverse ecosystems on our planet, but 
      also maintain the human harvesting of natural resources and livelihoods of hundreds 
      of millions of people. However, the abundance and distribution characteristics of 
      microplastics in coral reef systems receive little scientific attention. Meanwhile, 
      the impacts of microplastics and nanoplastics on coral health and its potential 
      mechanisms remain further studied. Herein, this review first summarized the current 
      status of microplastics pollution in global coral reefs, especially included (i) 
      abundance and distribution characteristics of microplastics in different media 
      (e.g., seawater, sediment, corals), and (ii) possible sources of microplastics in 
      reef regions. Furthermore, the main interaction mechanisms between microplastics and 
      corals are highlighted. Following this, the direct or indirect impacts of 
      microplastics on coral species are discussed. With the rapid increase of plastic 
      consumption and background of pervasive global coral bleaching, research on marine 
      microplastics must focus on the critical coral reef regions and include a 
      comprehensive knowledge about the distribution, fate, and potential risks from an 
      ecosystem perspective.

AB  - Emissions of plastic waste to the environment and the subsequent degradation into 
      microplastic particles that have the potential to interact with biological organisms 
      represent a concern for global society. Current understanding of the potential 
      impacts on aquatic and terrestrial population stability and ecosystem structure and 
      function associated with emissions of microplastic particles is limited and 
      insufficient to fully assess environmental risks. Multistakeholder discussions can 
      provide an important element in helping to identify and prioritize key knowledge 
      gaps in assessing potential risks. In the present review, we summarize 
      multistakeholder discussions from a 1-d International Council of Chemical 
      Associations-sponsored symposium, which involved 39 scientists from 8 countries with 
      representatives from academia, industry, and government. Participants were asked to 
      consider the following: discuss the scientific merits and limitations of applying a 
      proposed conceptual environmental risk assessment (ERA) framework for microplastic 
      particles and identify and prioritize major research needs in applying ERA tools for 
      microplastic particles. Multistakeholder consensus was obtained with respect to the 
      interpretation of the current state of the science related to effects and exposure 
      to microplastic particles, which implies that it is unlikely that the presence of 
      microplastic in the environment currently represents a risk. However, the quality 
      and quantity of existing data require substantial improvement before conclusions 
      regarding the potential risks and impacts of microplastic particles can be fully 
      assessed. Research that directly addresses the development and application of 
      methods that strengthen the quality of data should thus be given the highest 
      priority. Activities aimed at supporting the development of and access to 
      standardized reference material were identified as a key research need. Environ

TI  - Norwegian Soils and Waters Contain Mesophilic, Plastic-Degrading Bacteria.

AB  - Plastic pollution has become one of the most critical environmental issues, as 
      rapidly increasing production, compounded by persistence of plastic wastes in the 
      environment, are outpacing efforts to keep ecosystems plastic-free. A switch to 
      plastics more amenable to microbial attack is one of several possible responses. 
      Against this background, the current study describes the isolation, enumeration and 
      polyphasic characterization of plastic-degrading bacteria present in Norwegian 
      terrestrial and aquatic habits. It shows that these bacteria are present in 
      relatively high numbers, and that plastic-degrading capabilities are found in 
      several taxa, most especially Streptomyces. Some isolates wereable to degrade 
      several plastics. Notably, a Rhodococcus sp. and a Streptomyces sp. degraded, 
      respectively, four and six of the eight plastics investigated and a number of other 
      polymers relevant for plastic blends. The paper also has a methodological aspect, 
      presenting various approaches for assaying plastic-degrading properties and a 
      PCR/sequencing-based approach for the identification of potential polyethylene 
      terephthalate-degrading genes. A candidate gene was detected in several Streptomyces 
      isolates. The study shows that Norwegian environments are a rich source of bacteria 
      with the ability to degrade bioplastics possibly representing a natural remediation 
      capacity, as well as a potential source of useful enzymes.

TI  - Plasticizer Degradation by Marine Bacterial Isolates: A Proteogenomic and 
      Metabolomic Characterization.
PG  - 2244-2256
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.9b05228 [doi]
AB  - Many commercial plasticizers are toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are added 
      to plastics during manufacturing and may leach out once they reach the environment. 
      Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) 
      and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are now increasingly being replaced with 
      more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC). 
      While the metabolic pathways for PAE degradation have been established in the 
      terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for ATBC biodegradation 
      have not been identified previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine 
      environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and 
      isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the first 
      time, identified the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to 
      degrade three different plasticizers (i.e., DBP, DEHP, and ATBC) via a comprehensive 
      proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-OMIC study also 
      revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the 
      different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway) 
      as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, 
      phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for ATBC than for PAE 
      plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the 
      biofilms that colonize plastics-the Plastisphere-to effectively biodegrade plastic 
      additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity 
      in the environment.

TI  - Transport and Burial of Microplastics in Deep-Marine Sediments by Turbidity 
      Currents.
PG  - 4180-4189
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.9b07527 [doi]
AB  - The threat posed by plastic pollution to marine ecosystems and human health is under 
      increasing scrutiny. Much of the macro- and microplastic in the ocean ends up on the 
      seafloor, with some of the highest concentrations reported in submarine canyons that 
      intersect the continental shelf and directly connect to terrestrial plastic sources. 
      Gravity-driven avalanches, known as turbidity currents, are the primary process for 
      delivering terrestrial sediment and organic carbon to the deep sea through submarine 
      canyons. However, the ability of turbidity currents to transport and bury plastics 
      is essentially unstudied. Using flume experiments, we investigate how turbidity 
      currents transport microplastics, and their role in differential burial of 
      microplastic fragments and fibers. We show that microplastic fragments become 
      relatively concentrated within the base of turbidity currents, whereas fibers are 
      more homogeneously distributed throughout the flow. Surprisingly, the resultant 
      deposits show an opposing trend, as they are enriched with fibers, rather than 
      fragments. We explain this apparent contradiction by a depositional mechanism 
      whereby fibers are preferentially removed from suspension and buried in the deposits 
      as they are trapped between settling sand-grains. Our results suggest that turbidity 
      currents potentially distribute and bury large quantities of microplastics in 
      seafloor sediments.

TI  - Sources, transport, measurement and impact of nano and microplastics in urban 
      watersheds.

AB  - The growing and pervasive presence of plastic pollution has attracted considerable 
      interest in recent years, especially small (< 5 mm) plastic particles known as 
      'microplastics' (MPs). Their widespread presence may pose a threat to marine 
      organisms globally. Most of the nano and microplastic (N&MP) pollution in marine 
      environments is assumed to originate from land-based sources, but their sources, 
      transport routes, and transformations are uncertain. Information on freshwater and 
      terrestrial systems is lacking, and data on nanoplastic pollution are particularly 
      sparse. The shortage of systematic studies of freshwater and terrestrial systems is 
      a critical research gap because estimates of plastic release into these systems are 
      much higher than those for oceans. As most plastic pollution originates in urban 
      environments, studies of urban watersheds, particularly those with high population 
      densities and industrial activities, are especially relevant with respect to source 
      apportionment. Released plastic debris is transported in water, soil, and air. It 
      can be exchanged between environmental compartments, adsorb toxic compounds, and 
      ultimately be carried long distances, with potential to cause both physical and 
      chemical harm to a multitude of species. Measurement challenges and a lack of 
      standardized methods has slowed progress in determining the environmental prevalence 
      and impacts of N&MPs. An overall aim of this review is to report the sources and 
      abundances of N&MPs in urban watersheds. We focus on urban watersheds, and summarize 
      monitoring methods and their limitations, knowing that identifying N&MPs and their 
      urban/industrial sources is necessary to reduce their presence in all environments.

AB  - The wide and intensive application of plastics and their derived products has 
      resulted in global environmental contamination of plastic waste. Large-sized plastic 
      litter can be fragmented into microplastics (<5 mm), which have attracted increasing 
      concerns from the general public and scientific communities worldwide. Until 
      recently, the majority of microplastics research reported in literatures has been 
      focusing on the aquatic settings, especially the marine environment, while 
      information about microplastics contamination in terrestrial soil systems is highly 
      insufficient. In this paper, we reviewed the latest data regarding the occurrence of 
      microplastics in terrestrial soils and discussed their potential pathways into the 
      soil environment. We also summarized the currently used methodologies for extraction 
      and characterization of microplastics in soil matrices and evaluated their 
      advantages and limitations. Additionally, we assessed the ecotoxicological 
      consequences of microplastics contamination on soil ecosystems, including the 
      effects on soil physiochemical properties, terrestrial plants, soil fauna, and soil 
      microbes. Finally, based on the most current progress summarized in this review, we 
      suggested several directions for future research on microplastics in soil 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Subsidies of energy and material from the riparian zone have large impacts on 
      recipient stream habitats. Human-induced changes, such as deforestation, may 
      profoundly affect these pathways. However, the strength of individual factors on 
      stream ecosystems is poorly understood since the factors involved often interact in 
      complex ways. We isolated two of these factors, manipulating the flux of terrestrial 
      input and the intensity of light in a 2×2 factorial design, where we followed the 
      growth and diet of two size-classes of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and the 
      development of periphyton, grazer macroinvertebrates, terrestrial invertebrate 
      inputs, and drift in twelve 20 m long enclosed stream reaches in a five-month-long 
      experiment in a boreal coniferous forest stream. We found that light intensity, 
      which was artificially increased 2.5 times above ambient levels, had an effect on 
      grazer density, but no detectable effect on chlorophyll a biomass. We also found a 
      seasonal effect on the amount of drift and that the reduction of terrestrial prey 
      input, accomplished by covering enclosures with transparent plastic, had a negative 
      impact on the amount of terrestrial invertebrates in the drift. Further, trout 
      growth was strongly seasonal and followed the same pattern as drift biomass, and the 
      reduction of terrestrial prey input had a negative effect on trout growth. Diet 
      analysis was consistent with growth differences, showing that trout in open 
      enclosures consumed relatively more terrestrial prey in summer than trout living in 
      covered enclosures. We also predicted ontogenetic differences in the diet and growth 
      of old and young trout, where we expected old fish to be more affected by the 
      terrestrial prey reduction, but we found little evidence of ontogenetic differences. 
      Overall, our results showed that reduced terrestrial prey inputs, as would be 
      expected from forest harvesting, shaped differences in the growth and diet of the 
      top predator, brown trout.

AB  - Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the intracellular lipid reserve accumulated by many 
      bacteria. The most potent terrestrial bacterium Bacillus cereus SE-1 showed more PHB 
      accumulating cells (22.1 and 40% after 48 and 72 h) than that of the marine Bacillus 
      sp. CS-605 (5 and 33% after 48 and 72 h). Both the isolates harbored phbB gene and 
      the characteristics C=O peak was observed in the extracted PHB by Fourier 
      transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis. Maltose was found to be the most 
      suitable carbon source for the accumulation of PHB in B. cereus SE-1. The extracted 
      PHB sample from B. cereus SE-1 was blended with a thermoplastic starch (TS) and an 
      increased thermoplasticity and decreased crystallinity were observed after blending 
      in comparison to the standard PHB. The melting temperature (Tm), melting enthalpy 
      (∆Hf), and crystallinity (Xc) of the blended PHB sample were found to be 109.4 °C, 
      64.58 J/g, and 44.23%, respectively.

      reference to phytotoxicity.

LID - 10.1111/gcb.15074 [doi]
AB  - Plastic pollution has become a global concern for ecosystem health and biodiversity 
      conservation. Concentrations of plastics are manifold higher in the terrestrial 
      system than the aquatic one. Micro/nanoplastics (M/NP) have the ability to alter 
      soil enzymatic system, soil properties and also affect soil borne microorganisms and 
      earthworms. Despite, the knowhow regarding modulatory effects of plastics are 
      acquired from the study on aquatic system and reports on their phytotoxic potentials 
      are limited. The presence of cell wall that could restrict M/NP invasion into plant 
      roots might be the putative cause of this limitation. M/NP inhibit plant growth, 
      seed germination and gene expression; and they also induce cytogenotoxicity by 
      aggravating reactive oxygen species generation. Dynamic behavior of cell wall; the 
      pores formed either by cell wall degrading enzymes or by plant-pathogen interactions 
      or by mechanical injury might facilitate the entry of into roots M/NP. This review 
      also provides a possible mechanism of large sized microplastics-induced 
      phytotoxicity especially for those that cannot pass through cell wall pores. As M/NP 
      affect soil microbial community and soil parameters, it is hypothesized that they 
      could have the potential to affect N(2) fixation and research should be conducted in 
      this direction. Reports on M/NP-induced toxicity mainly focused only on one polymer 
      type (polystyrene) in spite of the toxicological relevancies of other polymer types 
      like polyethylene, polypropylene etc. So, the assessment of phytotoxic potential of 
      M/NP should be done using other plastic polymers in real environment as they are 
      known to intract with other environmental stressors as well as can alter the the 
      soil-microbe-plant interaction.

TI  - Root Plasticity in the Pursuit of Water.
LID - 10.3390/plants8070236 [doi]
LID - 236
AB  - One of the greatest challenges of terrestrial vegetation is to acquire water through 
      soil-grown roots. Owing to the scarcity of high-quality water in the soil and the 
      environment's spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, ranging from extreme 
      flooding to drought, roots have evolutionarily acquired tremendous plasticity 
      regarding their geometric arrangement of individual roots and their 
      three-dimensional organization within the soil. Water deficiency has also become an 
      increasing threat to agriculture and dryland ecosystems due to climate change. As a 
      result, roots have become important targets for genetic selection and modification 
      in an effort to improve crop resilience under water-limiting conditions. This review 
      addresses root plasticity from different angles: Their structures and geometry in 
      response to the environment, potential genetic control of root traits suitable for 
      water-limiting conditions, and contemporary and future studies of the principles 
      underlying root plasticity post-Darwin's 'root-brain' hypothesis. Our increasing 
      knowledge of different disciplines of plant sciences and agriculture should 
      contribute to a sustainable management of natural and agricultural ecosystems for 
      the future of mankind.

AB  - Micro- and nano-scale plastic particles in the environment result from their direct 
      release and degradation of larger plastic debris. Relative to macro-sized plastics, 
      these small particles are of special concern due to their potential impact on 
      marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. While microplastic (MP) pollution has 
      been widely studied in geographic regions globally, many questions remain about its 
      origins. It is assumed that urban environments are the main contributors but 
      systematic studies are lacking. The absence of standard methods to characterize and 
      quantify MPs and smaller particles in environmental and biological matrices has 
      hindered progress in understanding their geographic origins and sources, 
      distribution, and impact. Hence, the development and standardization of methods is 
      needed to establish the potential environmental and human health risks. In this 
      study, we investigated stable carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), 
      attenuated total reflectance - Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, 
      and micro-Raman spectroscopy (μ-Raman) as complementary techniques for 
      characterization of common plastics. Plastic items selected for comparative analysis 
      included food packaging, containers, straws, and polymer pellets. The ability of 
      IRMS to distinguish weathered samples was also investigated using the simulated 
      weathering conditions of ultraviolet (UV) light and heat. Our IRMS results show a 
      difference between the δ(13)C values for plant-derived and petroleum-based polymers. 
      We also found differences between plastic items composed of the same polymer but 
      from different countries, and between some recycled and nonrecycled plastics. 
      Furthermore, increasing δ(13)C values were observed after exposure to UV light. The 
      results of the three techniques, and their advantages and limitations, are 
      discussed.

AB  - Plastic waste and microplastic pollution has been reported around the world. Up to 
      80% of marine plastic debris is derived from land, thus it is important to identify 
      the terrestrial sources of microplastics to reduce their environmental impact. In 
      this study, the abundance and polymer type of microplastics were characterized for 
      road dusts collected from Kumamoto, Okinawa, and Tokyo, Japan. In addition, the 
      profiles of additives in plastic products on the road and in road dust microplastics 
      were determined to evaluate the potential use of additives as chemical tracers of 
      microplastic sources. The abundance of microplastics in road dusts was 
      96 ± 85 pieces/kg (dry wt.) (n = 16), 68 ± 77 pieces/kg (n = 12), and 
      230 ± 50 pieces/kg (n = 8) in Kumamoto, Okinawa and Tokyo, respectively. In Kumamoto 
      and Okinawa, significant correlations were observed between total microplastic 
      abundance in road dusts and daily vehicle traffic. In Tokyo, high population and 
      traffic density may account for the greater abundance of microplastics in road dusts 
      than in the other cities. Polymer analysis shows that poly (diallyl phthalate), 
      polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate and polyester accounted for 60% to 70% 
      of the total microplastics analyzed. To determine the potential sources of 
      microplastics, plastic additives were analyzed in road dusts and fragments of road 
      marking from the study area. Five common additives including plasticizers and flame 
      retardants were identified in both road dusts and road markings. This suggests that 
      road markings are a significant source of microplastics in Japanese road dust, and 
      that additive profiles in plastic samples may be suitable tracers for determining 
      the sources of microplastics in road dust.

AB  - Significant quantities of plastic debris pollute nearly all the world's ecosystems, 
      where it persists for decades and poses a considerable threat to flora and fauna. 
      Much of the focus has been on the marine environment, with little information on the 
      hazard posed by debris accumulating on beaches and adjacent vegetated areas. Here we 
      investigate the potential for beach debris to disrupt terrestrial species and 
      ecosystems on two remote islands. The significant quantities of debris on the 
      beaches, and throughout the coastal vegetation, create a significant barrier which 
      strawberry hermit crabs (Coenobita perlatus) encounter during their daily 
      activities. Around 61,000 (2.447 crabs/m(2)) and 508,000 crabs (1.117 crabs/m(2)) 
      are estimated to become entrapped in debris and die each year on Henderson Island 
      and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, respectively. Globally, there is an urgent need to 
      establish a clear link between debris interactions and population persistence, as 
      loss of biodiversity contributes to ecosystem degradation. Our findings show 
      accumulating debris on these islands has the potential to seriously impact hermit 
      crab populations. This is important for countless other islands worldwide where 
      crabs and debris overlap, as crabs play a crucial role in the maintenance of 
      tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Papio originated in the early Pleistocene and diverged into multiple species, six of 
      which are extant. Among parapatric Papio species, there are obvious phenotypic 
      differences that arose during the radiation of the genus. We use data from modern 
      baboon ecology and morphology, as well as fossils and paleoecology, to examine 
      baboon biogeography, divergence, and evolution, focusing on skull form and body 
      mass. To provide context, techniques of historical biogeography, combining data from 
      modern distributions in statistical models alongside qualitative assessments of the 
      fossil record, were used to estimate ancestral ranges in papionins. The ancestral 
      range of Papio was estimated to be in South Tropical Africa rather than in the far 
      south of the continent, followed by multiple movements south and west. Progress to 
      the north and east may have been slowed because of high-density blocking of niches 
      by other monkeys. Geometric morphometric data were used in partial least squares 
      analysis with dietary, environmental, and other variables to investigate skull 
      differentiation. Environment was significantly correlated with skull form, but diet 
      emerged as more significant. Exploitation of subterranean foods was found to be an 
      important influence on skull morphology. Bayesian modeling of cercopithecid body 
      mass data allowed reconstruction of ancestral body mass and showed a pattern of 
      accelerating body mass evolution in a number of lineages. This appears to be related 
      to exploitation of terrestrial niches in the Pliocene, with terrestriality also 
      implicated in the large geographic distributions of many fossil and modern 
      papionins, including Papio. Given the greater heterogeneity of body masses in males, 
      size differentiation within Papio seems most likely to be linked to sexual selection 
      rather than environmental factors, although further work is required to examine the 
      relative importance of plasticity versus local adaptation in shaping baboon 
      phenotypic variation.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs, plastic particles < 5 mm) are an ever-increasing global issue 
      due to their widespread occurrence in the environment and negative effects on 
      organisms. Currently, more than 96 % of MPs studies are related to marine systems. 
      However, the majority of marine MPs pollution has been confirmed to originate from 
      land-based sources, evidence of MPs in the terrestrial system cannot be overlooked. 
      In this manuscript, up-to-date knowledge regarding the sources and occurrence of MPs 
      from the terrestrial system is comprehensively reviewed. According to the different 
      studies both in China and abroad, microfibers derived from textile washing 
      attributed approximately 35 % of the MPs identified in the aquatic system. 
      Additionally, personal care and cosmetic products, tires, agricultural plastic 
      films, artificial turfs and road paints, landfill, littering, packaging and 
      construction industry can also release MPs to the environment. The aquatic system 
      plays an important role in MPs transport. By using a one-way ANOVA test, 
      polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) accounted for significantly higher 
      percentages than other polymer compositions in surface water. Polyamide (PA) and PP 
      accounted for the majority of polymers in soils. PP, PE, and polystyrene (PS) 
      presented an overwhelming proportion in sediment. Atmospheric deposition presents a 
      new vehicle for entering into the wider environment. More research is urgently 
      required on the topic of exposure risk of atmospheric MPs via inhalation. 
      Morphological characteristics including shapes, sizes, and colors have been 
      discussed among waters, soils, sediments and airborne. These source-occurrence 
      implications continuum summaries can bring us new insights that we cannot 
      underestimate the severity of MPs from land-based sources and should pay more 
      attention to MPs contamination in the terrestrial ecosystem.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a new, pressing, environmental topic. Microplastics are 
      considered contaminants of emerging concern and, consequently, microplastic research 
      has grown exponentially in the last decade. Here, current knowledge regarding the 
      impacts of micro- and nanoplastics on terrestrial plants and aquatic macrophytes is 
      discussed, with a special focus on adsorption, uptake and toxicological effects. Our 
      review reveals that a range of plants and macrophytes can adsorb or internalise 
      plastic particles. Both processes depend on particle characteristics such as size 
      and charge, as well as plant features including a sticky or hydrophobic surface 
      layer. This finding is of concern given that plants and aquatic macrophytes are at 
      the bottom of food webs and are a crucial component of the human diet. Therefore, 
      there is a critical need for improved understanding of adsorption, uptake and 
      impacts of micro- and nanoplastics, and the consequences thereof for trophic 
      transfer, food safety and security. Also, a range of stress responses have been 
      observed for many plant and macrophyte species after both short and long-term 
      exposures to plastic particles. Given that some plastic particles can affect plant 
      productivity, we surmise that plastic particles may potentially impact ecosystem 
      productivity and function. Here we present a synthesis and a critical evaluation of 
      the state of knowledge of micro- and nanoplastics and plants and macrophytes, 
      identifying key questions for future research.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging threat to ecosystem functioning and biota. The 
      major sources of MPs are terrestrial and agricultural lands. But their fate, 
      concentration in the terrestrial environment, and effects on soil and biota are 
      poorly understood. There is a growing body of concern about the adverse effects of 
      MPs on soil-dwelling organisms such as microbes in mycorrhizae and earthworms that 
      mediate essential ecosystem services. Environmental concentrations and effects of 
      MPs are considered to increase with increasing trend of its global production. MPs 
      in the soil could directly impact plants through blocking the seed pore, limiting 
      the uptake of water and nutrient through roots, aggregation, and accumulation in the 
      root, shoot, and leaves. However, MPs can also indirectly impact plants by affecting 
      soil physicochemical characteristics, soil-dwelling microbes, and fauna. An affected 
      soil could impact plant community structure and perhaps primary production. In this 
      article, we have assessed the potential direct and indirect impacts of MPs on 
      plants. We have discussed both the positive and negative impacts of MPs on plants in 
      terrestrial systems based on currently available limited literature on this topic 
      and our hypothetical understandings. We have summarized the most current progress in 
      this regard highlighting the future directions on microplastic research in 
      terrestrial systems.

AB  - The ability to maintain a (relatively) stable body temperature in a wide range of 
      thermal environments by use of endogenous heat production is a unique feature of 
      endotherms such as birds. Endothermy is acquired and regulated via various endocrine 
      and molecular pathways, and ultimately allows wide aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial 
      distribution in variable environments. However, due to our changing climate, birds 
      are faced with potential new challenges for thermoregulation, such as more frequent 
      extreme weather events, lower predictability of climate, and increasing mean 
      temperature. We provide an overview on thermoregulation in birds and its endocrine 
      and molecular mechanisms, pinpointing gaps in current knowledge and recent 
      developments, focusing especially on non-model species to understand the generality 
      of, and variation in, mechanisms. We highlight plasticity of thermoregulation and 
      underlying endocrine regulation, because thorough understanding of plasticity is key 
      to predicting responses to changing environmental conditions. To this end, we 
      discuss how changing climate is likely to affect avian thermoregulation and 
      associated endocrine traits, and how the interplay between these physiological 
      processes may play a role in facilitating or constraining adaptation to a changing 
      climate. We conclude that while the general patterns of endocrine regulation of 
      thermogenesis are quite well understood, at least in poultry, the molecular and 
      endocrine mechanisms that regulate, e.g. mitochondrial function and plasticity of 
      thermoregulation over different time scales (from transgenerational to daily 
      variation), need to be unveiled. Plasticity may ameliorate climate change effects on 
      thermoregulation to some extent, but the increased frequency of extreme weather 
      events, and associated changes in resource availability, may be beyond the scope 
      and/or speed for plastic responses. This could lead to selection for more tolerant 
      phenotypes, if the underlying physiological traits harbour genetic and individual 
      variation for selection to act on - a key question for future research.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants that have been extensively detected in 
      marine and terrestrial environments. Landfills are receptacles for cumulative 
      loading of plastic waste derived from industry and households, but data on MPs 
      occurrences in landfill systems are lacking. In the current study, the occurrence, 
      characteristics and distribution patterns of MPs in landfills (including leachate 
      and refuse) of the megacity Shanghai were investigated in accordance with different 
      landfill ages (3-20 years). The results revealed that the average abundances of MPs 
      in leachate and refuse were 8 (±3) items/L and 62 (±23) items/g, respectively. The 
      predominant shapes and polymer types of the detected MPs were fibers and cellophane 
      in leachate, whereas they were fragments and polyethylene in refuse. The patterns of 
      abundance and size distribution of MPs in refuse varied from different landfill age, 
      and different polymer MPs exhibited various occurrence patterns with increasing 
      landfill age. Further spectra analysis suggested the presence of oxidative 
      degradation of polyethylene MPs in the landfill process, especially for the landfill 
      time of more than 20 years, so the fates of MPs in landfills were determined by the 
      increase consumptions of plastics products and the degradation process of MPs in 
      landfills. This study firstly provided a systematic overview of MPs pollution 
      characteristics in landfill systems, and the results will foster the understanding 
      of MPs fates over a long time scale in the environments.

AB  - Toxin-producing cyanobacteria in aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments can 
      occur alongside a wide range of additional health hazards including biological 
      agents and synthetic materials. Cases of intoxications involving cyanobacteria and 
      cyanotoxins, with exposure to additional hazards, are discussed. Examples of the 
      co-occurrence of cyanobacteria in such combinations are reviewed, including 
      cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins plus algal toxins, microbial pathogens and fecal 
      indicator bacteria, metals, pesticides, and microplastics. Toxicity assessments of 
      cyanobacteria, cyanotoxins, and these additional agents, where investigated in 
      bioassays and in defined combinations, are discussed and further research needs are 
      identified.

AB  - As an emerging environmental pollutant, microplastics (MPs) are increasingly viewed 
      as a serious health concern to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. However, previous 
      toxicological studies examining MPs on freshwater and terrestrial organisms provide 
      contradictory results, possibly due to few investigations at environmentally 
      relevant concentrations. Here, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a 
      model organisms with both aquatic and terrestrial free-living forms, was employed to 
      investigate the effects of 1 and 5 μm MPs (10(7)-10(10) particles/m(2)) on the 
      intake, lifespan, defecation rhythm, defecation-related neurons and transcriptional 
      expression of related genes (skn-1, mkk-4, pmk-1, cpr-1 and itr-1). We demonstrated 
      that the percentage of MP-contaminated nematodes increased with increasing exposure 
      concentrations and duration. The lifespan of nematodes in the lower concentration 
      exposure groups (2.4 × 10(7) and 2.4 × 10(8) particles/m(2)) decreased more 
      prominently than that of higher concentration groups (2.4 × 10(9) and 
      2.4 × 10(10) particles/m(2)) after a 72-h exposure period. Concomitantly, expression 
      of the skn-1 gene, involved in detoxification and lifespan regulation, was 
      significantly altered at lower MP concentrations. Physiologically, the defecation 
      rhythm after a 72-h exposure period was most strongly affected by 1 μm MPs at 
      2.4 × 10(8) particles/m(2). The significant up-regulation of related genes by 1 μm 
      MPs appears responsible for the shortened defecation interval. Results of this study 
      identified a potential toxicity threat to C. elegans from exposure to MPs at 
      environmentally relevant concentrations and provide novel evidence for MP risks to 
      freshwater and terrestrial organisms. Capsule. After exposure to 1 and 5 μm MPs 
      (10(7)-10(10) particles/m(2)), the lifespan of C. elegans decreased more rapidly at 
      lower concentrations.

AB  - About 90% of the plastic garbage remains in terrestrial ecosystems, and increasing 
      evidence highlights the exposure of crops to plastic particles. However, the 
      potential bioaccumulation of microplastics by plants and their effects on plants' 
      physiology remains unexplored. Here, we evaluated the adsorption, potential uptake, 
      and physiological effects of polyethylene (PE) microbeads in an experimental 
      hydroponic culture of maize. Using isotope analysis, taking advantage of the 
      different carbon isotope composition (δ(13)C) of fossil-derived PE and C(4) plants 
      (e.g., maize), we estimated that about 30% of the carbon in the rhizosphere of 
      microplastic-exposed plants was derived from PE. Still, we did not find evidence of 
      PE translocation to the shoots. Plastic bioaccumulation in the rhizosphere caused a 
      significant decline in transpiration, nitrogen content, and growth. Our results 
      indicate that plastic particles may accumulate in the rhizosphere, impairing water 
      and nutrient uptake, and eventually reaching root eaters. Due to the implications 
      for food production and livestock feeding, our findings encourage further research 
      on the mechanism leading to the bioaccumulation of microplastics on the surface of 
      belowground tissues.

AB  - We report the presence of 'plasticrusts' and 'pyroplastic' from coastal habitats in 
      Giglio island, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. These novel plastic debris types have only 
      recently been described for the first time from Madeira island (NE Atlantic Ocean) 
      and the United Kingdom, respectively. While 'plasticrusts' are generated by sea 
      waves smashing plastic debris against intertidal rocks, 'pyroplastic' derives from 
      (un)deliberately burnt plastic waste. Using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) 
      spectroscopy, we identified the 'plasticrust' material as polyethylene (PE) and the 
      'pyroplastic' material as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). These polymers are 
      widely used in everyday products and, therefore, contribute heavily to plastic 
      pollution in aquatic and terrestrial environments worldwide. Furthermore, our field 
      surveys suggest that 'plasticrust' abundance is related to wave-exposure and that 
      the 'pyroplastic' derived from beverage bottles which we frequently found along the 
      Giglio coast. Overall, our findings corroborate the notion that 'plasticrusts' and 
      'pyroplastic' are common debris types in marine coastal habitats.

AB  - Plastics, owing to their various beneficial properties (durability, flexibility and 
      lightweight nature), are widely regarded as the workhorse material of our modern 
      society. Being ubiquitously and increasingly present over the past 60 years, they 
      provide various benefits to the global economy. However, inappropriate and/or 
      uncontrolled disposal practices, poor waste management infrastructure, and 
      application of insufficient recycling technologies, coupled with a lack of public 
      awareness and incentives, have rendered plastic waste (PW) omnipresent, littering 
      both the marine and the terrestrial environment with multifaceted impacts. The 
      plastic marine litter issue has received much attention, especially in the past 
      decade. There is a plethora of articles and reports released on an annual basis, as 
      well as a lot of ongoing research, which render the issue either to be overexposured 
      or misconstrued. In addition, there are several misinterpretations that surround the 
      presence and environmental impact of plastics in the oceans and, consequently, human 
      health, that require much more critical and scientific thinking. This short 
      communication aims at unveiling any existing misconceptions and attempts to place 
      this global challenge within its real magnitude, based either on scientific facts or 
      nuances. Graphical abstract.

AB  - Soil and sludge are important pools for microplastics (MPs), however standard 
      separation methods for MPs from these pools are still missing. We tested the widely 
      used methods for MPs extraction from water and sediment to six agriculture surface 
      soils and three sewage sludges from municipal wastewater treatment plants and 
      included an additional pre-digestion procedure with 30% H(2)O(2) before floatation 
      to remove soil or sludge organic matter (OM). Extraction efficiency of MPs were 
      evaluated under different separation conditions, including floatation solution 
      (NaCl, ZnCl(2), and NaI), filtration membrane, and oxidation solution. Results 
      showed that H(2)O(2) pre-digestion significantly increased MPs extraction in soil 
      and sludge, especially the samples with high OM contents, particularly sludge. 
      Floatation solution with higher densities recovered more MPs. The extra released MPs 
      were mainly small fibrous MPs, probably because they are easily retained by 
      aggregates. Our results provide an feasible separation method for MPs in soil and 
      sludge, i.e., pre-digestion with 30% H(2)O(2) at 70 °C, floatation with NaI 
      solution, filtration through nylon membrane, and further oxidation with 30% 
      H(2)O(2) + H(2)SO(4) or 30% H(2)O(2) at 70 °C. About 420-1290 MP items/kg soil were 
      detected in soil samples, while much higher numbers (5553-13460 MP items/kg) were 
      found in sludge samples. The dominate morphology of MPs was white fiber with a size 
      of 0.02-0.25 mm, while the main types of MPs, identified by a micro-Fourier 
      transformed infrared spectroscopy (μ-FTIR), were polyethylene and polypropylene in 
      soil samples and polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyacrylonitrile in 
      sludge samples.

AB  - Although atmospheric transport and deposition could be an important pathway of 
      terrestrial pollutants to the ocean, little information concerning the presence and 
      distribution of these suspended atmospheric microplastics in marine air is 
      available. We investigated, for the first time, the occurrence and distribution of 
      suspended atmospheric microplastics (SAMPs) in the west Pacific Ocean. In this 
      study, the spatial distribution, morphological appearance, and chemical composition 
      of suspended atmospheric microplastics were studied through continuous sampling 
      during a cruise. SAMPs abundance ranged from 0 to 1.37 n/m(3), the median of 0.01 
      n/m(3). Fiber, fragment, and granule SAMPs quantitively constituted 60%, 31%, and 8% 
      of all MPs, respectively. Interestingly, plastic microbeads with numerical 
      proportion of 5% were also observed. A high suspended atmospheric microplastics 
      abundance was found in the coastal area (0.13 ± 0.24 n/m(3)), while there was less 
      amount detected in the pelagic area (0.01 ± 0.01 n/m(3)). The amount of suspended 
      atmospheric microplastics collected during the daytime (0.45 ± 0.46 n/m(3)) was 
      twice the amount collected at night (0.22 ± 0.19 n/m(3)), on average. Our 
      observations provide field-based evidence that suspended atmospheric microplastics 
      are an important source of microplastics pollution in the ocean, especially the 
      pollution caused by textile microfibers.

TI  - Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics: The Predator-Prey Adaptive Play and the Ecological 
      Theater.
PG  - 481-489
AB  - The emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics has demonstrated that both 
      ecological and evolutionary processes can occur contemporaneously. Ecological 
      interactions, such as between predator and prey, are important focal areas where an 
      eco-evolutionary perspective can advance understanding about phenotypically plastic 
      and adaptive evolutionary responses. In predator-prey interactions, both species 
      reciprocally respond and adapt to each other in order to simultaneously ensure 
      resource consumption and predation avoidance. Here we sketch out a way to help unify 
      experimental and analytical approaches to both eco-evolutionary dynamics and 
      predator-prey interactions, with a specific focus on terrestrial systems. We discuss 
      the need to view predator-prey eco-evolutionary dynamics as a perpetually adaptive 
      interplay with constantly shifting pressures and feedbacks, rather than viewing it 
      as driving a set evolutionary trajectory. We then outline our perspective on how to 
      understand eco-evolutionary patterns in a predator-prey context. We propose 
      initiating insight by distinguishing phenotypic plasticity against genetic change 
      (i.e., "molecular reductionism") and further applying a landscape-scale perspective 
      (i.e., "landscape holism"). We believe that studying predator-prey interactions 
      under an eco-evolutionary lens can provide insights into how general and, 
      consequently, predictable species' evolutionary responses are to their contemporary 
      environments.

AB  - Plastic contamination is an environmental problem spreading to even the most remote 
      aquatic and terrestrial habitats and in particular, microplastics represent an 
      uncertain threat for organisms. Microplastics can have a direct negative effect, but 
      they can also potentially modify the toxicity and bioavailability of pollutants. 
      Here, we tested over 1 week the combined effect of three different glyphosate 
      chemical formulations (glyphosate acid, glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt, and 
      Roundup Gran) and two types of microplastics (polyethylene (PE) microbeads and 
      polyethylene terephthalate/polyamide (PET/PA) fibers), on Daphnia magna. 
      Glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt caused the highest mortality after 1 week 
      exposure (23.3%), whereas glyphosate acid the lowest (12.5%), when tested in the 
      absence of microplastics. These results were inverted, however, when the individuals 
      were exposed in combination with the PE microbeads (glyphosate acid: 53.3% and 
      glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt: 18.3%) or the PET/PA fibers (glyphosate acid: 
      30.0% and glyphosate-monoisopropylamine salt: 8.3%). The mortality in the Roundup 
      Gran formulation also increased when combined with the two microplastics, though the 
      effect was less pronounced. In all experiments, the effect of the treatments and 
      time was significant, though there was no significant interaction between them. In 
      most treatments, negative effects were not observed after 48 h or later. The change 
      in toxicity of the glyphosate formulations caused by microplastics can be linked to 
      the different sorption properties of the glyphosate-based chemicals formulations. 
      The outcome of this study highlights that beside the potential direct negative 
      effects of microplastics, they can modify the toxicity of pollutants, such as 
      herbicides.

LID - 10.1242/jeb.126649 [doi]
AB  - Amphibious fishes spend part of their life in terrestrial habitats. The ability to 
      tolerate life on land has evolved independently many times, with more than 200 
      extant species of amphibious fishes spanning 17 orders now reported. Many 
      adaptations for life out of water have been described in the literature, and 
      adaptive phenotypic plasticity may play an equally important role in promoting 
      favourable matches between the terrestrial habitat and behavioural, physiological, 
      biochemical and morphological characteristics. Amphibious fishes living at the 
      interface of two very different environments must respond to issues relating to 
      buoyancy/gravity, hydration/desiccation, low/high O2 availability, low/high CO2 
      accumulation and high/low NH3 solubility each time they traverse the air-water 
      interface. Here, we review the literature for examples of plastic traits associated 
      with the response to each of these challenges. Because there is evidence that 
      phenotypic plasticity can facilitate the evolution of fixed traits in general, we 
      summarize the types of investigations needed to more fully determine whether 
      plasticity in extant amphibious fishes can provide indications of the strategies 
      used during the evolution of terrestriality in tetrapods.

TI  - Temperature-size responses match latitudinal-size clines in arthropods, revealing 
      critical differences between aquatic and terrestrial species.
PG  - 327-35
LID - 10.1111/ele.12413 [doi]
AB  - Two major intraspecific patterns of adult size variation are plastic 
      temperature-size (T-S) responses and latitude-size (L-S) clines. Yet, the degree to 
      which these co-vary and share explanatory mechanisms has not been systematically 
      evaluated. We present the largest quantitative comparison of these gradients to 
      date, and find that their direction and magnitude co-vary among 12 arthropod orders 
      (r(2) = 0.72). Body size in aquatic species generally reduces with both warming and 
      decreasing latitude, whereas terrestrial species have much reduced and even opposite 
      gradients. These patterns support the prediction that oxygen limitation is a major 
      controlling factor in water, but not in air. Furthermore, voltinism explains much of 
      the variation in T-S and L-S patterns in terrestrial but not aquatic species. While 
      body size decreases with warming and with decreasing latitude in multivoltine 
      terrestrial arthropods, size increases on average in univoltine species, consistent 
      with predictions from size vs. season-length trade-offs.

AB  - Microplastics are plastic fragments of particle sizes less than 5 mm, which are 
      widely distributed in marine and terrestrial environments. In this study, earthworms 
      Eisenia fetida were exposed to 100 and 1000 μg of 100 nm and 1300 nm fluorescent 
      polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) per kg of artificial soil for 14 days. Uptake or 
      accumulation of PS-MPs in earthworm intestines, histopathological changes, oxidative 
      stress, and DNA damage were assessed to determine the toxicological effects of 
      PS-MPs on E. fetida. The results showed that the average accumulated concentrations 
      in the earthworm intestines were higher for 1300 nm PS-MPs (0.084 ± 0.005 and 
      0.094 ± 0.003 μg/mg for 100 and 1000 μg/kg, respectively) than for 100 nm PS-MPs 
      (0.015 ± 0.001 and 0.033 ± 0.002 μg/mg for 100 and 1000 μg/kg, respectively). In 
      addition, histopathological analysis indicated that the intestinal cells were 
      damaged after exposure to PS-MPs. Furthermore, PS-MPs significantly changed 
      glutathione (GSH) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The GSH levels were 
      86.991 ± 7.723, 165.436 ± 4.256-167.767 ± 18.642, and 
      93.590 ± 4.279-173.980 ± 15.523 μmol/L in the control, 100 nm, and 1300 nm PS-MPs 
      treatment groups. In addition, the SOD activities were 10.566 ± 0.621, 
      9.039 ± 0.787-9.408 ± 0.493, and 7.959 ± 0.422-9.195 ± 0.327 U/mg protein for the 
      control, 100 nm, and 1300 nm PS-MPs treatment groups, respectively, indicating that 
      oxidative stress was induced after PS-MPs exposure. Furthermore, the comet assay 
      suggested that exposure to PS-MPs induced DNA damage in earthworms. Overall, 1300 nm 
      PS-MPs showed more toxic effect than 100 nm PS-MPs on earthworms. These findings 
      provide new insights regarding the toxicological effects of low concentrations of 
      microplastics on earthworms, and on the ecological risks of microplastics to soil 
      animals.

TI  - Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs.
PG  - 460-462
LID - 10.1126/science.aar3320 [doi]
AB  - Plastic waste can promote microbial colonization by pathogens implicated in 
      outbreaks of disease in the ocean. We assessed the influence of plastic waste on 
      disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific 
      region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in 
      contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be 
      affected by plastic, suggesting that microhabitats for reef-associated organisms and 
      valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral 
      reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic waste entering the 
      ocean. We estimate that 11.1 billion plastic items are entangled on coral reefs 
      across the Asia-Pacific and project this number to increase 40% by 2025. Plastic 
      waste management is critical for reducing diseases that threaten ecosystem health 
      and human livelihoods.

AB  - Microplastics are plastic particles which are widely distributed in the environment. 
      The pollution of microplastics in environment have attracted increasing attention in 
      recent years. This paper reviews research progress in sources, analytical methods, 
      eco-environmental effects and control in environment, and suggests relevant 
      countermeasures in governance and research. Microplastics mainly originate from two 
      sources: firstly, a significant direct input of primary microplastics; second, 
      secondary microplastics generate from the fragmentations of larger plastic 
      materials. The analysis and identification of microplastics are critical to other 
      researches, and related instrument methods have also been applied to the analysis 
      and identification of microplastics. The advantages and disadvantages of 
      microplastics analytical methods were reviewed. The eco-environmental effects of 
      microplastics can be divided into four aspects: adsorption, biological uptake, 
      ecotoxicological and combined pollution. Control measures need to strengthen the 
      systematic research of microplastics pollution control and management technology 
      system from the aspects of organizational cooperation, technological research and 
      development, laws and regulations. In the future, a unified quantitative analysis 
      method for microplastics should be established, and more accurate traceability 
      analysis techniques should be developed to further explore its environmental 
      behavior and fate. To strengthen scientific research on microplastic pollution in 
      terrestrial, freshwater and atmospheric environments, and develop more scientific 
      and rational control policies. This paper aims to provide a theoretical basis for 
      the prevention and control of microplastics pollution, and also provides insights 
      for the next step of research.

AB  - Plastic litter is widely acknowledged as a global environmental threat, and poor 
      management and disposal lead to increasing levels in the environment. Of recent 
      concern is the degradation of plastics from macro- to micro- and even to nanosized 
      particles smaller than 100 nm in size. At the nanoscale, plastics are difficult to 
      detect and can be transported in air, soil, and water compartments. While the impact 
      of plastic debris on marine and fresh waters and organisms has been studied, the 
      loads, transformations, transport, and fate of plastics in terrestrial and 
      subsurface environments are largely overlooked. In this Critical Review, we first 
      present estimated loads of plastics in different environmental compartments. We also 
      provide a critical review of the current knowledge vis-à-vis nanoplastic (NP) and 
      microplastic (MP) aggregation, deposition, and contaminant cotransport in the 
      environment. Important factors that affect aggregation and deposition in natural 
      subsurface environments are identified and critically analyzed. Factors affecting 
      contaminant sorption onto plastic debris are discussed, and we show how polyethylene 
      generally exhibits a greater sorption capacity than other plastic types. Finally, we 
      highlight key knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to improve our ability to 
      predict the risks associated with these ubiquitous contaminants in the environment 
      by understanding their mobility, aggregation behavior and their potential to enhance 
      the transport of other pollutants.

AB  - Microplastics are widespread contaminants in terrestrial environments but 
      comparatively little is known about interactions between microplastics and common 
      terrestrial contaminants such as zinc (Zn). In adsorption experiments fragmented 
      HDPE bags c. one mm(2) in size showed similar sorption characteristics to soil. 
      However, when present in combination with soil, concentrations of adsorbed Zn on a 
      per mass basis were over an order of magnitude lower on microplastics. Desorption of 
      the Zn was minimal from both microplastics and soil in synthetic soil solution (0.01 
      M CaCl(2)), but in synthetic earthworm guts desorption was higher from microplastics 
      (40-60%) than soil (2-15%), suggesting microplastics could increase Zn 
      bioavailability. Individual Lumbricus terrestris earthworms exposed for 28 days in 
      mesocosms of 260 g moist soil containing 0.35 wt % of Zn-bearing microplastic 
      (236-4505 mg kg(-1)) ingested the microplastics, but there was no evidence of Zn 
      accumulation, mortality, or weight change. Digestion of the earthworms showed that 
      they did not retain microplastics in their gut. These findings indicate that 
      microplastics could act as vectors to increase metal exposure in earthworms, but 
      that the associated risk is unlikely to be significant for essential metals such as 
      Zn that are well regulated by metabolic processes.

AB  - Microplastic pollution is ubiquitous and has emerged as a severe global 
      environmental issue. Recent research on microplastic pollution has mainly focused on 
      aquatic ecosystems, while knowledge gaps still exist regarding microplastic in 
      terrestrial environments. In this study, we established a new method for 
      characterizing microplastic in complex soil substrate using FTIR spectroscopy. 
      Microplastic was separated by density without removing soil organic matter to 
      protect microplastic from damage. The Wizards feature was adopted to automatic, 
      direct and continuous characterize micron-size plastic. Furthermore, 33 soil samples 
      were taken from Guiyu, a notorious e-waste dismantling area in Guangdong Province, 
      China, under different land-use. The results showed that microplastic was involved 
      in 30 samples, and the abundance of microplastic varied considerably among different 
      soils, ranged from 0 to 34,100n kg(-1), implying that the e-waste dismantling sites 
      have become the microplastic hotspots. There were 60 kinds of microplastic detected 
      with 6 different shapes and 10 colors, most of which were secondary microplastic. 
      They mainly consisted of engineering-plastic and modified plastic, 88.61% had a size 
      range <1 mm, indicating that the majority of microplastics at Guiyu were derived 
      from e-wastes. The surface morphology of microplastic showed signs of aging and 
      degradation, possibly due to primitive dismantling methods and long-term exposure to 
      the soil. The mean Pb, Cd, Cr, Ba, Cu, Co, As concentrations of microplastic were 
      20.94, 0.67, 11.82, 308.78, 4.11, 1.26, 3.06 μg·g(-1), respectively. Our findings 
      providescientific basis for monitoring and controlling microplastic pollution in 
      terrestrial environments.

AB  - Increasing microplastics pollution of marine and terrestrial water is a concerning 
      issue for ecosystems and human health. Nevertheless, the interaction of 
      microplastics with freshwater biota is still a poorly explored field. In order to 
      achieve information concerning the uptake, distribution and effect of microplastics 
      in planarians, Dugesia japonica specimens have been fed with mixtures of food and 
      differently shaped and sized plastic particles. Feeding activity and food intake 
      were non-altered by the presence of high concentrations of different types of 
      plastic particles. However, the persistence of microplastic within the planarian 
      body was a function of size/shape, being small spheres (<10 μm in diameter) and 
      short fibers (14 μm large and 5/6 μm length) more persisting than larger spheres and 
      longer fibers which were eliminated almost entirely by ejection in a few hours. 
      Transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that at least part of 
      microplastics was phagocytized by the enterocytes. Chronic exposure to small plastic 
      did not alter the regenerative ability but caused a significant reduction of the gut 
      epithelium thickness and lipid content of enterocytes, together with the induction 
      of apoptotic cell death, modulation of Djgata 4/5/6 expression and reduced growth 
      rate. The ability of microplastic to perturb planarian homeostasis is concerning 
      being them extremely resilient against mechanical and chemical insults and suggests 
      possible harmful effects upon other more susceptible species in freshwater 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Nano- and microplastics have been widely spread in environmental matrices, 
      especially in marine and terrestrial systems. In this study, higher plant Vicia faba 
      root tips were exposed to 5 μm and 100 nm with 10, 50 and 100 mg/L polystyrene 
      fluorescent microplastics (PS-MPs) for 48 h. Root length, weight, oxidative stress 
      and genotoxicity of V. faba were assessed to investigate toxic effects of PS-MPs. 
      The results showed that the biomass and catalase (CAT) enzymes activity of V. faba 
      roots decreased under 5 μm PS-MPs whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase 
      (POD) enzymes activity significantly increased. Under the 100 nm PS-MPs exposure a 
      significant decrease of growth was observed only at the highest concentration 
      (100 mg/L). However, micronucleus (MN) test and antioxidative enzymes activities 
      showed that 100 nm PS-MPs induce higher genotoxic and oxidative damage to V. faba 
      than 5 μm PS-MPs. Furthermore, the laser confocal scanning microscopy (LCSM) 
      demonstrated that 100 nm PS-MPs can accumulate in V. faba root and most probably 
      block cell connections or cell wall pores for transport of nutrients. These findings 
      provide a new insight into the toxic effects of microplastics on V. faba, and 
      further apply to the ecological risk assessment of microplastics on higher plants.

AB  - Multiple studies in freshwater environments have verified that microplastic 
      particles are present in water columns, sediment, and aquatic organisms. These 
      studies indicated that certain freshwater ecosystems may act as temporary sinks of 
      microplastic particles, leading to accumulation in the sediment and the ingestion by 
      benthic organisms. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the non-buoyant 
      polymers that has been frequently found in aquatic sediments. This study aims to 
      investigate a possible transfer of PET microfibers from aquatic to the terrestrial 
      habitats and addressed selected effects (i.e. survival, general stress response, and 
      growth) of PET microfibers using Chironomus riparius, a frequently applied model 
      organism in ecotoxicological research. To assess the growth and development of C. 
      riparius, a modified 28-day sediment chronic toxicity test was conducted, in which 
      the main endpoint is time until emergence of the larvae. In this assay, C. riparius 
      were exposed to artificial sediments spiked with PET microfibers. In addition, 
      weight and head capsule lengths of the larvae were also measured. As a general 
      stress response marker on the molecular level, Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) levels 
      were measured in two involved life stages, i.e. larvae and adults. Using staining 
      method, ingestion of PET microfibers was verified in the adult sample. Our results 
      clearly demonstrated that ingested microfibers by C. riparius larvae can be carried 
      through subsequent life stages and end up in the adults. Accordingly, this is the 
      first proof of aquatic-terrestrial transfer of PET microfibers for C. riparius. 
      However, toxicity test results showed that there was no significant effect on the 
      time until emergence, weight or head capsule lengths in the organisms exposed to PET 
      microfibers compared to control organisms. HSP70 measurements showed no significant 
      effects between control and exposure groups in the same life stage. The result 
      suggests that PET microfibers in the applied concentration do not exert adverse 
      effects both on organism and subcellular level in one generation.

AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous in the aquatic and terrestrial environment. To prevent 
      further contamination, methods to determine their sources are needed. Techniques to 
      quantify and characterize microplastics in the environment are still evolving for 
      polymers and the additives and leachable substances embedded therein, which 
      constitute the "chemical fingerprint" of an environmental microplastic. There is a 
      critical need for analytical methods that yield such diagnostic information on 
      environmental microplastics that enables identification of their composition and 
      sources of pollution. This study reports on a novel approach for rapid 
      fingerprinting of environmental microplastics and the screening of additives using 
      Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART)-high resolution mass spectrometry. A variety of 
      plastic samples were investigated, including virgin pre-production pellets, 
      microbeads from personal care products, microplastics found in the aquatic 
      environment, and synthetic fibers. The resulting mass spectra display ∼10,000 
      discrete peaks, corresponding to plastic additives released by thermal desorption 
      and polymer degradation products generated by pyrolysis. These were used to 
      characterize differences among plastic types, microplastic source materials, and 
      environmental samples. Multivariate statistics and elemental composition analysis 
      approaches were applied to analyze fingerprints from the mass spectra. This 
      promising analytical approach is sensitive, (potentially) high-throughput, and can 
      aid in the elucidation of possible sources of microplastics and perhaps eventually 
      to the analysis of bulk environmental samples for plastics.

AB  - Amphibious plants thrive in areas with fluctuating water levels, partly as a result 
      of their capacity to make specialized leaves when submerged or emerged. The 
      tailor-made leaves improve gas exchange underwater or prevent aerial desiccation. 
      Aquatic leaves are thin with narrow or dissected forms, thin cuticles and fewer 
      stomata. These traits can combine with carbon-concentrating mechanisms and various 
      inorganic carbon utilization strategies. Signalling networks underlying this 
      plasticity include conserved players like abscisic acid and ethylene, but closer 
      inspection reveals greater variation in regulatory behaviours. Moreover, it seems 
      that amphibious leaf development overrides and reverses conserved signalling 
      pathways of their terrestrial counterparts. The diversity of physiology and 
      signalling makes plant amphibians particularly attractive for gaining insights into 
      the evolution of signalling and crop improvement.

AB  - Biodegradable plastics made from biopolymers (made in nature) or from bio-based 
      polymers (made in a factory) are becoming increasingly important in replacing the 
      massive amounts of conventional, non-degradable fossil-based plastics that have been 
      produced and disposed over the past decades. In this review we compare the 
      biodegradation rates and mechanisms of the bioplastics thermoplastic starch, 
      cellulose acetate and lignin based bioplastics with the biodegradation rates and 
      mechanisms of starch, cellulose and lignin, which are the unmodified biopolymers 
      from which these bioplastics are produced. With this comparison we aim to determine 
      to what extent the extensive knowledge on unmodified biopolymer biodegradation can 
      be applied to the biodegradation of bioplastics (modified biopolymers) in the 
      terrestrial environment. This knowledge is important, since it can be of great help 
      in giving direction to the future research and development of bioplastics and for 
      the development of bioplastic waste assessments and policies. We found that the 
      similarities and differences in biodegradation are dependent on the structural 
      changes imposed on a biopolymer during the bioplastic production process. A change 
      in higher level structure, as found in thermoplastic starch, only resulted in a 
      limited number of differences in the biodegradation process. However, when the 
      chemical structure of a polymer is changed, as for cellulose acetate, different 
      microorganisms and enzymes are involved in the biodegradation. Based on the 
      cellulose acetate biodegradation process, a conceptual model was proposed that can 
      be used as a starting point in predicting biodegradation rates of other chemically 
      modified biopolymers used as bioplastics. Future bioplastic biodegradation research 
      should focus on conducting long-term field experiments, since most studies are 
      conducted in a laboratory setting and do not capture all processes occurring in the 
      field situation. This applies even more to lignin based bioplastics, since very 
      little experimental data were available on modified lignin biopolymer 
      biodegradation.

AB  - Weathering of microplastics (MPs, < 5 mm) in terrestrial and aquatic environments 
      affects MP transport and distribution. This paper first summarizes the sources of 
      MPs, including refuse in landfills, biowastes, plastic films, and wastewater 
      discharge. Once MPs enter water and soil, they undergo different weathering 
      processes. MPs can be converted into small molecules (e.g., oligomers and monomers), 
      and may be completely mineralized under the action of free radicals or 
      microorganisms. The rate and extent of weathering of MPs depend on their 
      physicochemical properties and environmental conditions of the media to which they 
      are exposed. In general, water dissipates heat better, and has a lower temperature, 
      than land; thus, the weathering rate of MPs in the aquatic environment is slower 
      than in the terrestrial environment. These weathering processes increase 
      oxygen-containing functional groups and the specific surface area of MPs, which 
      influence the sorption and aggregation that occur between weathered MPs and their 
      co-existing constituents. More studies are needed to investigate the various 
      weathering processes of diverse MPs under natural field conditions in soils, 
      sediments, and aquatic environments, to understand the impact of weathered MPs in 
      the environment.

AB  - As microplastics (MPs) have become ubiquitous in both aquatic and terrestrial 
      environments, there has been a growing concern about these new anthropogenic 
      stressors. However, comparatively little is known about the negative effects of MPs, 
      co-contamination of MPs and heavy metals on terrestrial organisms. The objective of 
      this study was performed to understand the adverse effects of exposure to MPs and 
      co-exposure to MPs and cadmium (Cd) on the earthworm Eisenia foetida (E. foetida). 
      Results showed that exposure to MPs only or to a combination of MPs + Cd decreased 
      growth rate and increased the mortality (>300 mg kg(-1)) after exposure for 42 d, 
      with MPs + Cd (>3000 mg kg(-1)) posing higher negative influence on the growth of E. 
      foetida. Exposure to MPs might induce oxidative damage in E. foetida, and the 
      presence of Cd accelerates the adverse effects of MPs. Furthermore, the MPs 
      particles can be retained within E. foetida, with values of 4.3-67.2 particles·g(-1) 
      earthworm, and can increase the accumulation of Cd in earthworm from 9.7%-161.3%. 
      Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that combined exposure to MPs 
      and Cd poses higher negative effects on E. foetida, and that MPs have the potential 
      to increase the bioaccessibility of heavy metal ions in the soil environment.

AB  - Monitoring studies have quantified microscopic plastic debris, so-called 
      microplastics, in freshwater systems, including banks, surface waters and sediments. 
      However, there is a lack of knowledge of freshwater and terrestrial environments. 
      When microplastics are released in freshwater environments, they will be transported 
      and will not remain stationary. Moreover, their transport from sink to source 
      (land-based to river systems) may depend on several factors such as weather 
      conditions and river hydrology. The present study aims to investigate the abundance 
      and composition of microplastics in the most important river of Apulia Region 
      (Southeast Italy) evaluating the main drivers and possible input sources of 
      microplastic debris. The following work is the first study showing an Italian river 
      context. For this research five sampling campaigns have been conducted west of the 
      Ofanto river mouth. Microplastics were collected by three surface plankton nets 
      fixed in the middle of the river in order to reduce the spatial and temporal 
      variability. For each campaign, a total of six replicates were sampled during two 
      time slots. Microplastic concentrations ranged from 0.9 ± 0.4 p/m(3) to 13 ± 5 
      p/m(3) showing comparable values to or greater than those ones reported in other 
      studies. A statistically significant difference in the average microplastic 
      concentrations in different campaigns of this study has been observed, suggesting 
      thus a temporal variation in plastic abundances. These significant differences could 
      be explained by the hydrology of the river that influences the particle 
      concentration with its physical forces such as flow velocity, water level and 
      seasonal variability. Microplastics were found at higher concentrations during wet 
      periods indicating a land-based origin probably connected to waste produced by the 
      surroundings agricultural areas. In fact, Spearman's correlation results show a 
      strong positive statistically significant correlation between the concentration of 
      microplastics and the water level (R = 0.8475, p < 0.0001).

AB  - Microplastics can affect biophysical properties of the soil. However, little is 
      known about the cascade of events in fundamental levels of terrestrial ecosystems, 
      i.e., starting with the changes in soil abiotic properties and propagating across 
      the various components of soil-plant interactions, including soil microbial 
      communities and plant traits. We investigated here the effects of six different 
      microplastics (polyester fibers, polyamide beads, and four fragment types: 
      polyethylene, polyester terephthalate, polypropylene, and polystyrene) on a broad 
      suite of proxies for soil health and performance of spring onion ( Allium 
      fistulosum). Significant changes were observed in plant biomass, tissue elemental 
      composition, root traits, and soil microbial activities. These plant and soil 
      responses to microplastic exposure were used to propose a causal model for the 
      mechanism of the effects. Impacts were dependent on particle type, i.e., 
      microplastics with a shape similar to other natural soil particles elicited smaller 
      differences from control. Changes in soil structure and water dynamics may explain 
      the observed results in which polyester fibers and polyamide beads triggered the 
      most pronounced impacts on plant traits and function. The findings reported here 
      imply that the pervasive microplastic contamination in soil may have consequences 
      for plant performance and thus for agroecosystems and terrestrial biodiversity.

TI  - Destabilization of polyethylene and polyvinylchloride structure by marine bacterial 
      strain.
PG  - 1507-1516

AB  - Plastics are recalcitrant and inert to degrade, and destabilization leads to 
      accumulate in the terrestrial and marine ecosystems; need for the development of 
      strategies for reducing these plastic wastes in a sustainable manner would be 
      revolutionary. We studied the bacterial adherence, degradation and destabilization 
      of polyvinylchloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and high-density 
      polyethylene (HDPE) by marine bacterial strain AIIW2 by a series of analytical and 
      microscopic observations over 3 months. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence and the 
      phylogenetic analysis of the strain AIIW2, it showed 97.39% similarity with Bacillus 
      species. Degradation of plastics was determined by the weight loss after 90 days 
      with bacterial strain which detected up to 0.26 ± 0.02, 0.96 ± 0.02, and 1.0 ± 0.01% 
      for PVC, LDPE, and HDPE films, respectively over initial weights. The mineralization 
      of plastic film was found to be maximum in LDPE followed by HDPE and PVC. Bacterial 
      interaction had increased roughness and deteriorated the surface of plastics which 
      is revealed by the scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. Bending 
      vibrations of the alkane rock chain (-CH(2) and -CH(3)) and carbonyl (-CO) regions 
      in LDPE and HDPE films, while there was slight stretching in the hydroxyl (-OH) 
      regions of carboxylic acid in PVC which is evidenced through Fourier transform 
      infrared spectral studies, suggested the oxidative activities of the bacteria. 
      Though, the bacterial activity was higher on the LDPE and HDPE than PVC film which 
      may be due to the presence of chlorine atom in PVC structure making it more 
      versatile. The results of the present study revealed the ability of marine bacterial 
      strain for instigating their colonization over plastic films and deteriorating the 
      polymeric structure.

AB  - The microbial colonization of plastic wastes has been extensively studied in marine 
      environments, while studies on aged terrestrial wastes are scarce, and mostly 
      limited to the isolation of plastic-degrading microorganisms. Here we have applied a 
      multidisciplinary approach involving culturomics, next-generation sequencing 
      analyses and fine-scale physico-chemical measurements to characterize plastic wastes 
      retrieved in landfill abandoned for more than 35 years, and to assess the 
      composition of bacterial communities thriving as biofilms on the films' surfaces. 
      All samples were characterized by different colors but were all of polyethylene; IR 
      and DSC analyses identified different level of degradation, while FT-Raman 
      spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence further assessed the degradation level and the 
      presence of pigments. Each plastic type harbored distinct bacterial communities from 
      the others, in agreement with the differences highlighted by the physico-chemical 
      analyses. Furthermore, the most degraded polyethylene films were found to host a 
      bacterial community more similar to the surrounding soil as revealed by both α- and 
      β-diversity NGS analyses. This work confirms the novel hypothesis that different 
      polyethylene terrestrial waste samples select for different bacterial communities, 
      and that structure of these communities can be correlated with physico-chemical 
      properties of the plastics, including the degradation degree.

AB  - Conventional petrochemical plastics have become a serious environmental problem. Its 
      unbridled use, especially in non-durable goods, has generated an accumulation of 
      waste that is difficult to measure, threatening aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. 
      The replacement of these plastics with cleaner alternatives, such as 
      polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), can only be achieved by cost reductions in the 
      production of microbial bioplastics, in order to compete with the very low costs of 
      fossil fuel plastics. The biggest costs are carbon sources and nutrients, which can 
      be appeased with the use of photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, that 
      have a minimum requirement for nutrients, and also using agro-industrial waste, such 
      as the livestock industry, which in turn benefits from the by-products of PHA 
      biotechnological production, for example pigments and nutrients. Circular economy 
      can help solve the current problems in the search for a sustainable production of 
      bioplastic: reducing production costs, reusing waste, mitigating CO(2), promoting 
      bioremediation and making better use of cyanobacteria metabolites in different 
      industries.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs, plastics 100 nm-5 mm in diameter) are estimated to accumulate in 
      agricultural soils in quantities that exceed the total MP burden in ocean waters. 
      Despite a wealth of information relating to the accumulation of MPs in aquatic 
      species, there is little information on the uptake of MPs by terrestrial plants. 
      Information about location of MPs in plant tissues is critical to understand the 
      modes of their interaction with plants. Polystyrene (PS) is one of the most commonly 
      used plastic polymers worldwide and it is often found in MPs sampled in the 
      environment. The performance of traditional detection methods (i.e., transmission 
      electron microscopy, TEM and scanning electron microscopy, SEM) for nanoparticles is 
      limited due to the extensive sample preparation and the limited field of view. Here 
      we report an approach for the imaging of different sizes of PS plastic beads 
      (ranging from submicrometer to micrometer-sized) within plant tissues by using 
      confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Fluorescent dye Nile blue or 
      4-chloro-7-nitro-1,2,3-benzoxadiazole were encapsulated into the PS microbeads 
      through swelling method and they were used to detect the localization of PS beads in 
      the root and the green tissue respectively. •This is a simple and rapid approach for 
      imaging of MPs in plant.•The fluorescent dyes can produce bright and stable emission 
      signals that are distinguishable from the autofluorescence background of plant 
      tissues.•The dyes leakage in the aqueous phase can be assumed to be negligible.

TI  - Microplastics in Swiss Floodplain Soils.
PG  - 3591-3598
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.7b06003 [doi]
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are small (<5 mm diameter) but have clear implications for the 
      environment. These artificial particles are found in and pose threats to aquatic 
      systems worldwide. MPs have terrestrial sources, but their concentrations and fates 
      in the terrestrial environment are poorly understood. While global plastic 
      production continues to increase, so do the environmental concentrations and impacts 
      of MPs. In this first study of MPs in floodplain soils, we developed a method for 
      identifying, quantifying, and measuring the sizes of most commonly produced MPs in 
      soil by FT-IR microscopy. For small MP (<1 mm) analysis, MP were separated by 
      density separation and oxidation of organic matter. In this study we analyzed 29 
      floodplains in Swiss nature reserves associated with catchments covering 53% of 
      Switzerland. We found evidence that 90% of Swiss floodplain soils contain MPs. The 
      highest MP concentrations were associated with the concentration of mesoplastics (5 
      mm - 2.5 cm diameter), indicating plastic waste as source. Furthermore, MP 
      concentration was correlated with the population of the catchment. The wide 
      distribution of MPs, their presence in remote unsettled high mountain areas, 
      decoupling of MEP and MP compositions, and the dominance of MPs by small (<500 μm 
      diameter) particles, indicate that MPs enter soils via diffuse aeolian transport.

AB  - The high presence of microplastics (MPs) in different sizes, materials and 
      concentrations in the aquatic environment is a global concern due to their potential 
      physically and chemically harm to aquatic organisms including mammals. Furthermore, 
      the bioaccumulation of these compounds is leading to their ingestion by humans 
      through the consumption of sea food and even through the terrestrial food chain. 
      Even though conventional wastewater treatment plants are capable of eliminating more 
      than 90% of the influent MPs, these systems are still the main source of MPs 
      introduction in the environment due to the high volumes of effluents generated and 
      returned to the environment. The amount of MPs dumped by WWTP is influenced by the 
      configuration of the WWTP, population served and influent flow. Thus, the average of 
      MP/L disposed vary widely depending on the region. In addition to MPs disposed in 
      water bodies, more than 80% of these emerging contaminants, which enter the WWTP, 
      are retained in biosolids that can be applied as fertilizers, representing a 
      potential source of soil contamination. Due to the continuous disposal of MPs in the 
      environment by effluent treatment systems and their polluting potential, separation 
      and identification techniques have been assessed by several researchers, but 
      unfortunately, there are no standard protocols for them. Aiming to provide insight 
      about the relevance of studying the WWTP as source of MPs, this review summarizes 
      the currently methodologies used to classify and identify them.

TI  - Food or just a free ride? A meta-analysis reveals the global diversity of the 
      Plastisphere.
PG  - 789-806
LID - 10.1038/s41396-020-00814-9 [doi]
AB  - It is now indisputable that plastics are ubiquitous and problematic in ecosystems 
      globally. Many suggestions have been made about the role that biofilms colonizing 
      plastics in the environment-termed the "Plastisphere"-may play in the transportation 
      and ecological impact of these plastics. By collecting and re-analyzing all raw 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing and metadata from 2,229 samples within 35 studies, we have 
      performed the first meta-analysis of the Plastisphere in marine, freshwater, other 
      aquatic (e.g., brackish or aquaculture) and terrestrial environments. We show that 
      random forest models can be trained to differentiate between groupings of 
      environmental factors as well as aspects of study design, but-crucially-also between 
      plastics when compared with control biofilms and between different plastic types and 
      community successional stages. Our meta-analysis confirms that potentially 
      biodegrading Plastisphere members, the hydrocarbonoclastic Oceanospirillales and 
      Alteromonadales are consistently more abundant in plastic than control biofilm 
      samples across multiple studies and environments. This indicates the predilection of 
      these organisms for plastics and confirms the urgent need for their ability to 
      biodegrade plastics to be comprehensively tested. We also identified key knowledge 
      gaps that should be addressed by future studies.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability across life's hierarchies in the terrestrial 
      Antarctic.
PG  - 2307-31
AB  - Antarctica and its surrounding islands lie at one extreme of global variation in 
      diversity. Typically, these regions are characterized as being species poor and 
      having simple food webs. Here, we show that terrestrial systems in the region are 
      nonetheless characterized by substantial spatial and temporal variations at 
      virtually all of the levels of the genealogical and ecological hierarchies which 
      have been thoroughly investigated. Spatial variation at the individual and 
      population levels has been documented in a variety of genetic studies, and in mosses 
      it appears that UV-B radiation might be responsible for within-clump mutagenesis. At 
      the species level, modern molecular methods have revealed considerable endemism of 
      the Antarctic biota, questioning ideas that small organisms are likely to be 
      ubiquitous and the taxa to which they belong species poor. At the biogeographic 
      level, much of the relatively small ice-free area of Antarctica remains unsurveyed 
      making analyses difficult. Nonetheless, it is clear that a major biogeographic 
      discontinuity separates the Antarctic Peninsula and continental Antarctica, here 
      named the 'Gressitt Line'. Across the Southern Ocean islands, patterns are clearer, 
      and energy availability is an important correlate of indigenous and exotic species 
      richness, while human visitor numbers explain much of the variation in the latter 
      too. Temporal variation at the individual level has much to do with phenotypic 
      plasticity, and considerable life-history and physiological plasticity seems to be a 
      characteristic of Antarctic terrestrial species. Environmental unpredictability is 
      an important driver of this trait and has significantly influenced life histories 
      across the region and probably throughout much of the temperate Southern Hemisphere. 
      Rapid climate change-related alterations in the range and abundance of several 
      Antarctic and sub-Antarctic populations have taken place over the past several 
      decades. In many sub-Antarctic locations, these have been exacerbated by direct and 
      indirect effects of invasive alien species. Interactions between climate change and 
      invasion seem set to become one of the most significant conservation problems in the 
      Antarctic. We conclude that despite the substantial body of work on the terrestrial 
      biodiversity of the Antarctic, investigations of interactions between hierarchical 
      levels remain scarce. Moreover, little of the available information is being 
      integrated into terrestrial conservation planning, which lags far behind in this 
      region by comparison with most others.

TI  - Microplastics Differ Between Indoor and Outdoor Air Masses: Insights from Multiple 
      Microscopy Methodologies.

AB  - The abundance and distribution of microplastic (<5 mm) has become a growing concern, 
      particularly over the past decade. Research to date has focused on water, soil, and 
      organism matrices but generally disregarded air. We explored airborne microplastic 
      inside and outside of buildings in coastal California by filtering known volumes of 
      air through glass fiber filters, which were then subsequently characterized with a 
      variety of microscopy techniques: gross traditional microscopy, fluorescent 
      microscopy following staining with Nile red, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and 
      micro-Fourier transform infrared (µFT-IR) spectroscopy. Microplastics permeated the 
      air, with indoor (3.3 ± 2.9 fibers and 12.6 ± 8.0 fragments m(-3); mean ± 1 SD) 
      harboring twice as much as outdoor air (0.6 ± 0.6 fibers and 5.6 ± 3.2 fragments 
      m(-3)). Microplastic fiber length did not differ significantly between indoor and 
      outdoor air, but indoor microplastic fragments (58.6 ± 55 µm) were half the size of 
      outdoor fragments (104.8 ± 64.9 µm). Micro-Raman and FT-IR painted slightly 
      different pictures of airborne plastic compounds, with micro-Raman suggesting 
      polyvinyl chloride dominates indoor air, followed by polyethylene (PE) and µFT-IR 
      showing polystyrene dominates followed by PE and polyethylene terephthalate. The 
      ubiquity of airborne microplastic points to significant new potential sources of 
      plastic inputs to terrestrial and marine ecosystems and raises significant concerns 
      about inhalation exposure to humans both indoors and outdoors.

AB  - Information on the occurrence and effects of nanoplastics in ecosystems worldwide 
      currently represent one of the main challenges from the ecotoxicological point of 
      view. This is particularly true for terrestrial environments, in which nanoplastics 
      are released directly by human activities or derive from the fragmentation of larger 
      plastic items incorrectly disposed. Since insects can represent a target for these 
      emerging contaminants in land-based community, the aim of this study was the 
      evaluation of ingestion of 0.5 μm polystyrene nanoplastics and their effects in 
      silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae, a useful and well-studied insect model. The ingestion 
      of nanoplastics, the possible infiltration in the tissues and organ accumulation 
      were checked by confocal microscopy, while we evaluated the effects due to the 
      administered nanoplastics through a multi-tier approach based on insect development 
      and behaviour assessment, as endpoints at organism level, and the measurements of 
      some biochemical responses associated with the imbalance of the redox status 
      (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione s-transferase, reactive oxygen species 
      evaluation, lipid peroxidation) to investigate the cellular and molecular effects. 
      We observed the presence of microplastics in the intestinal lumen, but also inside 
      the larvae, specifically into the midgut epithelium, the Malpighian tubules and in 
      the haemocytes. The behavioural observations revealed a significant (p < 0.05) 
      increase of erratic movements and chemotaxis defects, potentially reflecting 
      negative indirect effects on B. mori survival and fitness, while neither effect on 
      insect development nor redox status imbalance were measured, with the exception of 
      the significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of superoxide dismutase activity.

AB  - Microplastics with extremely high abundances are universally detected in marine and 
      terrestrial systems. Microplastic pollution in the aquatic environment, especially 
      in ocean, has become a hot topic and raised global attention. However, microplastics 
      in soils has been largely overlooked. In this paper, the analytical methods, 
      occurrence, transport, and potential ecological risks of microplastics in soil 
      environments have been reviewed. Although several analytical methods have been 
      established, a universal, efficient, faster, and low-cost analytical method is still 
      not available. The absence of a suitable analytical method is one of the biggest 
      obstacles to study microplastics in soils. Current data on abundance and 
      distribution of microplastics in soils are still limited, and results obtained from 
      different studies differ significantly. Once entering into surface soil, 
      microplastics can migrate to deep soil through different processes, e.g. leaching, 
      bioturbation, and farming activities. Presence of microplastics with high abundance 
      in soils can alter fundamental properties of soils. But current conclusions on 
      microplastics on soil organisms are still conflicting. Overall, research on 
      microplastics pollution in soils is still in its infancy and there are gaps in the 
      knowledge of microplastics pollution in soil environments. Many questions such as 
      pollution level, ecological risks, transport behaviors and the control mechanisms 
      are still unclear, which needs further systematical study.

TI  - Gill remodelling during terrestrial acclimation in the amphibious fish Polypterus 
      senegalus.
PG  - 329-338
LID - 10.1002/jmor.20946 [doi]
AB  - Fishes are effectively weightless in water due to the buoyant support of the 
      environment, but amphibious fishes must cope with increased effective weight when on 
      land. Delicate structures such as gills are especially vulnerable to collapse and 
      loss of surface area out of water. We tested the 'structural support' hypothesis 
      that amphibious Polypterus senegalus solve this problem using phenotypically plastic 
      changes that provide mechanical support and increase stiffness at the level of the 
      gill lamellae, the filaments, and the whole arches. After 7 d in terrestrial 
      conditions, enlargement of an inter-lamellar cell mass filled the water channels 
      between gill lamellae, possibly to provide structural support and/or reduce 
      evaporative water loss. Similar gill remodelling has been described in several other 
      actinopterygian fishes, suggesting this may be an ancestral trait. There was no 
      change in the mechanical properties or collagen composition of filaments or arches 
      after 7 days out of water, but 8 months of terrestrial acclimation caused a 
      reduction in gill arch length and mineralized bone volume. Thus, rather than 
      increasing the size and stiffness of the gill skeleton, P. senegalus may instead 
      reduce investment in supportive gill tissue while on land. These results are 
      strikingly similar to the evolutionary trend of gill loss that occurred during the 
      tetrapod invasion of land, raising the possibility that genetic assimilation of gill 
      plasticity was an underlying mechanism.

TI  - Red/Far-Red Light Switchable Cargo Attachment and Release in Bacteria-Driven 
      Microswimmers.

AB  - In bacteria-driven microswimmers, i.e., bacteriabots, artificial cargos are attached 
      to flagellated chemotactic bacteria for active delivery with potential applications 
      in biomedical technology. Controlling when and where bacteria bind and release their 
      cargo is a critical step for bacteriabot fabrication and efficient cargo 
      delivery/deposition at the target site. Toward this goal, photoregulating the cargo 
      integration and release in bacteriabots using red and far-red light, which are 
      noninvasive stimuli with good tissue penetration and provide high spatiotemporal 
      control, is proposed. In the bacteriabot design, the surfaces of E. coli and 
      microsized model cargo particles with the proteins PhyB and PIF6, which bind to each 
      other under red light and dissociate from each other under far-red light are 
      functionalized. Consequently, the engineered bacteria adhere and transport the model 
      cargo under red light and release it on-demand upon far-red light illumination due 
      to the photoswitchable PhyB-PIF6 protein interaction. Overall, the proof-of-concept 
      for red/far-red light switchable bacteriabots, which opens new possibilities in the 
      photoregulation in biohybrid systems for bioengineering, targeted drug delivery, and 
      lab-on-a-chip devices, is demonstrated.

TI  - A Critical Review on the Impacts of Nanoplastics and Microplastics on Aquatic and 
      Terrestrial Photosynthetic Organisms.
PG  - e2005834

AB  - Microplastic and nanoplastic contamination is widespread and affects aquatic and 
      terrestrial ecosystems. Photosynthetic organisms are present in both media, they are 
      primary producers, sink for CO(2) , and they represent a major point of entry in the 
      food chain. Here, the current knowledge on the fate and impacts of microplastics and 
      nanoplastics in interaction with these organisms is reviewed. As a general trend, 
      plastic characteristics (smaller size and positive charge) play a crucial role in 
      their toxicity toward photosynthetic organisms. Plastic leachates (containing 
      additives) also represent a major source of toxicity, and some harmful compounds 
      such as phthalate esters are shown to accumulate in plants and generate a risk for 
      the consumers. Adsorption of plastic particles is evidenced for each type of 
      photosynthetic organism, and uptake and translocation in terrestrial plants is 
      evidenced for nanoplastics, leading to concerns for trophic chain contamination. The 
      available techniques for the detection of microplastics and nanoplastics and their 
      secondary products in biological samples and media are also listed. Finally, the 
      current gaps of knowledge, specific challenges, and future research directions are 
      also discussed.

TI  - [Pollution Status and Pollution Behavior of Microplastic in Surface Water and 
      Sediment of Urban Rivers].
PG  - 3612-3620
LID - 10.13227/j.hjkx.201912236 [doi]
AB  - Rivers have been a subject of great concern in recent years as they have been found 
      to be the critical path for the transmission of microplastics from terrestrial land 
      to the ocean. However, the pollution status of microplastics and their behavior in 
      the surface waters and sediments of urban rivers located in different urban areas 
      remain unclear. In this study, 16 samples of surface water and sediment from eight 
      rivers in the central and suburban areas of Shanghai Megacity were obtained and 
      analyzed. High-speed cameras and Fourier transform infrared spectrometers were used 
      to identify the abundance, size, color, shape, type, and other characteristics of 
      microplastics in these samples. The results showed that the average abundance of 
      microplastics in the surface waters of urban rivers in Shanghai Megacity was 
      (7.5±2.8) pieces·L(-1), while the corresponding average abundance in the sediment 
      reached (1575.5±758.4)pieces·kg(-1) (wet weight). The abundance of microplastics was 
      found to increase with the decreasing particle diameter. Among which, microplastics 
      with a size of less than 500 μm, as well as the fibrous shape, transparent color, 
      and Polyester composition, have always dominated in the urban rivers in Shanghai 
      megacity. Comparably, microplastics in the sediments were more diverse in their 
      morphology features and polymer compositions. Microplastic pollution in the urban 
      rivers in Shanghai megacity was severe in comparison to that in other urban rivers 
      worldwide. Among various urban rivers, the distribution of microplastics with 
      different morphology features and polymer compositions is greatly influenced by a 
      number of factors including the source (e.g., mainly laundry wastewater, personal 
      care products, and refuse plastic waste), hydrodynamic conditions, and the physical 
      and chemical properties of plastics. Furthermore, the pollution behavior (i.e., 
      source, transmission, and fate) of microplastics occurring in urban rivers is 
      discussed, and the potential impacts of various environmental factors are explained.

AB  - Microplastics are a global environmental issue contaminating aquatic and terrestrial 
      environments. They have been reported in atmospheric deposition, and indoor and 
      outdoor air, raising concern for public health due to the potential for exposure. 
      Moreover, the atmosphere presents a new vehicle for microplastics to enter the wider 
      environment, yet our knowledge of the quantities, characteristics and pathways of 
      airborne microplastics is sparse. Here we show microplastics in atmospheric 
      deposition in a major population centre, central London. Microplastics were found in 
      all samples, with deposition rates ranging from 575 to 1008 microplastics/m(2)/d. 
      They were found in various shapes, of which fibrous microplastics accounted for the 
      great majority (92%). Across all samples, 15 different petrochemical-based polymers 
      were identified. Bivariate polar plots indicated dependency on wind, with different 
      source areas for fibrous and non-fibrous airborne microplastics. This is the first 
      evidence of airborne microplastics in London and confirms the need to include 
      airborne pathways when consolidating microplastic impacts on the wider environment 
      and human health.

AB  - The impact of microplastic pollution on terrestrial biota is an emerging research 
      area, and this is particularly so for soil biota. In this study, we addressed this 
      knowledge gap by examining the impact of aged low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and 
      polyester fibres (i.e. polyethylene terephthalate, PET) on a forest microbiome 
      composition and activity. We also measured the corresponding physicochemical changes 
      in the soil. We observed that bacteria community composition diverged in PET and 
      LDPE treated soils from that of the control by day 42. These changes occurred at 
      0.2% and 0.4% (w/w) of PET and at 3% LDPE. Additionally, soil respiration was 8-fold 
      higher in soil that received 3% LDPE compared to other treatments and control. There 
      were no clear patterns linking these biological changes to physicochemical changes 
      measured. Taken together, we concluded that microplastics aging in the environment 
      may have evolutionary consequences for forest soil microbiome and there is immediate 
      implication for climate change if the observed increase in soil respiration is 
      reproducible in multiple ecosystems.

TI  - In silico Screening and Heterologous Expression of a Polyethylene Terephthalate 
      Hydrolase (PETase)-Like Enzyme (SM14est) With Polycaprolactone (PCL)-Degrading

AB  - Plastics, such as the polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are widely used for various 
      industrial applications, due to their physicochemical properties which are 
      particularly useful in the packaging industry. However, due to improper plastic 
      waste management and difficulties in recycling, post-consumer plastic waste has 
      become a pressing issue for both the environment and for human health. Hence, novel 
      technologies and methods of processing plastic waste are required to address these 
      issues. Enzymatic-assisted hydrolysis of synthetic polymers has been proposed as a 
      potentially more efficient and environment-friendly alternative to the currently 
      employed methods. Recently, a number of PET hydrolases have been described, and in 
      particular a PETase derived from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (IsPETase), which 
      appears to be the most efficient and substrate-specific bacterial PET hydrolase 
      enzyme discovered to date. In order to further investigate this class of PETase-like 
      enzymes, we employed an in silico-based screening approach on the biotechnologically 
      relevant genus Streptomyces, including terrestrial and marine isolates; in a search 
      for potential PETase homologs. From a total of 52 genomes analyzed, we were able to 
      identify three potential PETase-like enzymes, all of which were derived from 
      marine-sponge associated Streptomyces isolates. A candidate PETase-like gene 
      (SM14est) was identified in Streptomyces sp. SM14. Further in silico 
      characterization of the SM14est protein sequence and its predicted three-dimensional 
      structure were performed and compared to the well-characterized IsPETase. Both the 
      serine hydrolase motif Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly and the catalytic triad Ser, Asp, His are 
      conserved in both sequences. Molecular docking experiments indicated that the 
      SM14est enzyme possessed the capacity to bind plastics as substrates. Finally, 
      polyesterase activity was confirmed using a polycaprolactone (PCL) plate clearing 
      assay which is a model substrate for the degradation of plastics; following 
      heterologous expression of SM14est in Escherichia coli, with secretion being 
      facilitated by the native Streptomyces signal peptide. These findings provide 
      further insights into this important class of PETase-like enzymes.

AB  - Over the past five or six decades, contamination and pollution of the world's 
      enclosed seas, coastal waters and the wider open oceans by plastics and other 
      synthetic, non-biodegradable materials (generally known as 'marine debris') has been 
      an ever-increasing phenomenon. The sources of these polluting materials are both 
      land- and marine-based, their origins may be local or distant, and the environmental 
      consequences are many and varied. The more widely recognized problems are typically 
      associated with entanglement, ingestion, suffocation and general debilitation, and 
      are often related to stranding events and public perception. Among the less 
      frequently recognized and recorded problems are global hazards to shipping, 
      fisheries and other maritime activities. Today, there are rapidly developing 
      research interests in the biota attracted to freely floating (i.e. pelagic) marine 
      debris, commonly known as 'hangers-on and hitch-hikers' as well as material sinking 
      to the sea floor despite being buoyant. Dispersal of aggressive alien and invasive 
      species by these mechanisms leads one to reflect on the possibilities that ensuing 
      invasions could endanger sensitive, or at-risk coastal environments (both marine and 
      terrestrial) far from their native habitats.

AB  - Microplastics are considered to be ubiquitous and widespread emerging contaminants. 
      They are persistent in the nature and pose considerable harm to the environment. 
      Their omnipresence is documented in almost all aquatic habitats, several atmospheric 
      and terrestrial environments, and also in human consumables. The objective of this 
      review is to provide an overview of the environmental prevalence of the 
      microplastics in all environmental compartments, and their possible adverse impacts. 
      It also presents review of the studies conducted in India and the epitome of 
      potential mitigation measures. The need and direction of future research are 
      highlighted. The review will help in determining the exposure levels, environmental 
      consequences, and risk estimations, and will guide the researchers and policymakers.

TI  - Sampling and Quality Assurance and Quality Control: A Guide for Scientists 
      Investigating the Occurrence of Microplastics Across Matrices.
PG  - 1099-1125
LID - 10.1177/0003702820945713 [doi]
AB  - Plastic pollution is a defining environmental contaminant and is considered to be 
      one of the greatest environmental threats of the Anthropocene, with its presence 
      documented across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The majority of this plastic 
      debris falls into the micro (1 μm-5 mm) or nano (1-1000 nm) size range and comes 
      from primary and secondary sources. Its small size makes it cumbersome to isolate 
      and analyze reproducibly, and its ubiquitous distribution creates numerous 
      challenges when controlling for background contamination across matrices (e.g., 
      sediment, tissue, water, air). Although research on microplastics represents a 
      relatively nascent subfield, burgeoning interest in questions surrounding the fate 
      and effects of these debris items creates a pressing need for harmonized sampling 
      protocols and quality control approaches. For results across laboratories to be 
      reproducible and comparable, it is imperative that guidelines based on vetted 
      protocols be readily available to research groups, many of which are either new to 
      plastics research or, as with any new subfield, have arrived at current approaches 
      through a process of trial-and-error rather than in consultation with the greater 
      scientific community. The goals of this manuscript are to (i) outline the steps 
      necessary to conduct general as well as matrix-specific quality assurance and 
      quality control based on sample type and associated constraints, (ii) briefly review 
      current findings across matrices, and (iii) provide guidance for the design of 
      sampling regimes. Specific attention is paid to the source of microplastic pollution 
      as well as the pathway by which contamination occurs, with details provided 
      regarding each step in the process from generating appropriate questions to sampling 
      design and collection.

AB  - Concerns regarding microplastic contamination have spread from aquatic environments 
      to terrestrial systems with a growing number of studies have been reported. 
      Notwithstanding, the potential effects on soil ecosystems remain largely unexplored. 
      In this study, the effects of polyethylene microplastics on soil enzymatic 
      activities and the bacterial community were evaluated, and the microbiota colonizing 
      on microplastics were also investigated. Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per 
      kg soil) significantly increased the urease and catalase activities in soil after 15 
      days, and no discernible alteration of invertase activities was detected. Results 
      from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversities 
      (richness, evenness, and diversity) of the microbiota in soil were not obviously 
      changed by the PE amendment, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on plastic 
      fragments were significantly lower than those in the control and amended soils. 
      Different taxonomic composition was observed in between the control and amended 
      soils after 90 days of incubation. Bacterial assemblages with distinct community 
      structure colonized the PE microplastics. Additionally, several taxa including 
      plastic-degrading bacteria and pathogens were more abundant on microplastics. 
      Simultaneously, the predicted functional profiles showed that the pathways of amino 
      acid metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were higher on the 
      microplastics. These results indicated that microplastics in soil, compared with 
      those in aquatic environments, can also act as a distinct microbial habitat, 
      potentially altering the ecological functions of soil ecosystems.

AB  - Plasticizers are widespread environmental contaminants that have been described as 
      obesogens in terrestrial vertebrates. However, its effects on fish lipids 
      homeostasis are almost unknown. This work explores the use of PLHC-1 cells as an 
      alternative model to assess the disruption of hepatic lipids by plastic additives 
      and to gather information on the mode of action of these chemicals in fish. PLHC-1 
      lipid extracts were analyzed by flow injection coupled to high resolution mass 
      spectrometry (FIA-ESI(+/-)-Orbitrap-Exactive) after 24 h exposure of the cells to 
      the selected plasticizers: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
      (DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), and chlorinated bisphenol A diglycidyl 
      ether (BADGE·2HCl). The analysis of the culture medium and the intracellular 
      concentration of the chemicals revealed the highest bioconcentration of BADGE·2HCl, 
      DBP and DEHP, which was in agreement with the strongest alteration of the cells 
      lipidome. BADGE·2HCl induced a significant depletion of triacylglycerides (TGs), 
      while DEHP and DBP stimulated the accumulation of TGs. Exposure to BPF induced the 
      generation of reactive oxygen species in PLHC-1 cells and a significant depletion of 
      phosphatidylcholine (PC)- and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-plasmalogens, and TGs 
      (cell depots of polyunsaturated fatty acids). Overall, this study evidences 
      different modes of action of plastic additives in topminnow liver cells, describes 
      differential lipidomic signatures, and highlights the higher lipotoxicity of 
      BADGE·2HCl and BPF compared to BPA.

TI  - Electric clothes dryers: An underestimated source of microfiber pollution.
PG  - e0239165

LID - e0239165
AB  - Microplastics, particularly microfibers, are ubiquitous, found in aquatic 
      (freshwater and marine) and terrestrial environments and within the food web 
      worldwide. It is well-established that microplastics in the form of textile fibers 
      enter the environment via washing machines and wastewater treatment effluent. Less 
      is known about the release of microfibers from electric clothes dryers. In this 
      study we measure microfiber emissions from home installed dryers at two different 
      sites. At each site the distribution of fibers landing on the snow's surface outside 
      dryer vents and the weight of lint in dryer exhaust exiting dryer vents were 
      measured. Fibers from the pink polyester fleece blankets used in this study were 
      found in plots throughout a 30ft (9.14m) radius from the dryer vents, with an 
      average number across all plots of 404 ± 192 (SD) (Site 1) and 1,169 ± 606 (SD) 
      (Site 2). The majority of the fibers collected were located within 5 ft (1.52m) of 
      the vents. Averages of 35 ± 16(SD)mg (Site 1) and 70 ± 77 (SD)mg (Site 2) of lint 
      from three consecutive dry cycles were collected from dryer vent exhaust. This study 
      establishes that electric clothes dryers emit masses of microfiber directly into the 
      environment. Microfiber emissions vary based on dryer type, age, vent installation 
      and lint trap characteristics. Therefore, dryers should be included in discussions 
      when considering strategies, policies and innovations to prevent and mitigate 
      microfiber pollution.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution is an increasing global problem due to the ubiquity of 
      these particles in the environment and the uncertainty surrounding their fate. Most 
      MPs undergo extensive weathering in the environment, which may result in the release 
      of dissolved organic matter (DOM) into the aqueous phase. In this study, for the 
      first time, we examined the adsorptive behavior of MP-derived DOM (MP-DOM) on 
      minerals (kaolinite and goethite) using DOM samples leached from commercial plastics 
      including polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS) under dark and ultraviolet 
      (UV) irradiation conditions. MP-DOM was characterized by a higher distribution of 
      relatively smaller-sized molecules than natural organic matter (NOM). The PS-derived 
      DOM (PS-DOM) leached under UV treatment exhibited more oxygen-containing groups than 
      their counterparts in the dark. MP-DOM also exhibited net negative charges at 
      neutral pH ranges. Adsorption isotherm experiments revealed that the mineral 
      surfaces had high adsorption affinities for both types of MP-DOM, which is likely 
      associated with both electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange. The extent of 
      adsorption was greater for the UV-irradiated than the dark-treated DOM, and on 
      goethite compared to kaolinite. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the 
      residual PS-DOM after adsorption revealed differences in the adsorption affinities 
      between its functional groups. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy for the 
      irradiated PS-DOM showed that preferential adsorption occurred on minerals in the 
      sequential order of oxidized structures → (PS monomers) → carboxylates in 
      additives → carbonyl groups. The adsorption isotherm model parameters for MP-DOM 
      were comparable to those obtained from aquatic/terrestrial NOM, which suggests that 
      plastic-derived DOM can interact with minerals as strongly as NOM. This study 
      highlights the overlooked role played by plastic-derived DOM in mineral-enriched 
      environments, opening new opportunities for improving our understanding of the fate 
      and environmental impacts of MPs.

AB  - Plastics in the ocean are of great concern nowadays, and are often referred to as 
      the apocalyptic twin of climate change in terms of public fear and the problems they 
      pose to the aquatic and terrestrial environment. The number of studies focusing on 
      the ecological effects and toxicity of plastics has substantially increased in the 
      last few years. Considering the current trends in the anthropogenic activities, the 
      amount of plastics entering the world oceans is increasing exponentially, but the 
      oceans have a low assimilative capacity for plastics and the near-surface layer of 
      it is a finite space. If loading of the oceans with plastics continues at the 
      current rate, the thin sea surface microlayer can have a substantial amount of 
      plastics comparable to the distribution of phytoplankton, at least in the major 
      oceanic gyres and coastal waters in the future. Also, processes like biofouling can 
      cluster microplastics in dense fields in the near-surface layer. Plastics can 
      contribute to the warming or cooling of the water column by scattering and 
      attenuating incoming solar radiation, leading to a potential change in the optical 
      and other physico-chemical properties of the water column. We propose a new notion 
      that changes in solar radiation in the water column due to the plastics have the 
      potential to affect the physical processes in the ocean surface and near-surface 
      layers, and can induce climate feedback cycles. The future can be very different, if 
      plastics evolve as one of the key players affecting the ocean physical processes and 
      hence this is the time to tackle this puzzle with appropriate strategies or let the 
      genie out of the bottle.

AB  - The emerging threat that microplastic pollution poses to soil and its biota 
      necessitates the development of methods to detect microplastic ingestion by soil 
      animals. Fluorescent staining with Nile red dye has proven to be effective at 
      distinguishing microplastics from inorganic and some biological material but is not 
      suitable for separating them from invertebrate remains. Here, we report on the 
      development and validation of a novel fluorescent counterstaining technique for 
      detection of microplastics within terrestrial invertebrate biomass and fecal 
      material. After being stained with a blend of Calcofluor white and Evans blue dyes 
      in addition to Nile red, ground arthropod biomass appeared blueish-purple, whereas 
      different plastic polymers appeared red, green, and yellow when viewed under laser 
      scanning confocal microscopy. Nonarthropod invertebrate biomass and fecal material 
      were also distinguishable from plastic, though to a lesser extent. Our results 
      highlight the value of this method for detecting microplastic ingestion by 
      terrestrial invertebrates.

      To internalise the externalities associated with single-use containers, different 
      instruments, including a deposit refund scheme (DRS), have been operationalised in 
      many countries. Therefore, DRS is introduced in Scotland to reduce plastic litters 
      by increasing recycling rates and incentivising pro-environmental behavioural 
      change. This study addresses the complexity of single-use plastic containers by 
      analysing consumers' perceptions regarding the introduction of DRS in Scotland. 
      Using 940 comments from the BBC "Have Your Say" messageboard, this study adopts 
      sentiment analysis to understand consumers' opinions about the introduction and 
      implementation of DRS in Scotland. Findings suggest that a UK-wide scheme that is 
      similar in terms of operations and structure is required for DRS to be successful. 
      While consumers' knowledge and opinions about DRS are mixed, the efficacy of DRS 
      including its relevance is questioned and raises doubts about its contribution to 
      sustainability. The findings imply the need for UK countries to negotiate and 
      collaborate on appropriate and attractive interventions in addressing post-consumer 
      single-use plastic containers. The implications of the findings for policy and 
      practice, especially in improving the operations of DRS are further discussed.

AB  - The pollution of the aquatic and terrestrial environment with plastics is a fast 
      growing phenomenon with potential threats to the functioning of ecosystems and 
      organisms therein as well as for human well-being. So far, research activities have 
      mainly focused on the occurrence of microplastics (MP) in marine habitats, while 
      little is known about their distribution and composition in the terrestrial 
      environment. Agricultural practices such as fertilization, mulching or ensilage make 
      agriculture a likely path for MP into the environment. Here, we collected soil 
      samples at 15 farmland locations in Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany, to study 
      the amount, distribution and composition of MP in the size range between 1 and 5 mm. 
      In total, 379 MP were identified in a total of ~84 kg of dry weight (DW). Particle 
      abundances in the sampling units ranged from 0 to 217.8 MP per kg DW with a mean 
      abundance of 3.7 ± 11.9 MP per kg DW (median: 0.0, interquartile range: 0.0-4.9) per 
      site. Although MP were found at all study sites, only 34% of the sampling units 
      contained synthetic particles. Our data contribute to the establishment of a 
      baseline on the amount, type and size of MP in farmland soils. Such a baseline is 
      important for future monitoring schemes and for the development of more 
      environmentally friendly management systems that reduce the input of MP into the 
      agricultural system.

AB  - Marine debris and plastic pollution affect all coastal habitats, however coastal 
      debris studies are predominantly performed on sandy beaches. Other coastal habitats, 
      such as mangroves, remain understudied. Eighteen of the top twenty rivers that 
      contribute the most plastic to the ocean are associated with mangroves, but very few 
      of those forests were investigated in terms of plastic debris pollution. Here we 
      discuss the results of the few available studies on macrodebris conducted in 
      mangroves, which show that mangrove debris research is still in its early stages, 
      with many areas of study to be further investigated. Indeed, the distinct structural 
      complexity of mangroves increases their ability to trap debris from both 
      terrestrial, freshwater and marine sources, resulting in impacts unique to the 
      mangrove ecosystem. Our review highlights a significant lack in standardisation 
      across the performed surveys. Here we suggest standardised guidelines for future 
      integrated macrodebris and microplastic studies in mangroves to facilitate 
      comparisons between studies. Such standardisation should prioritize the use of 
      stratified random sampling, the measurement of the area covered by the debris and 
      the abundance and type of macrodebris and microplastics found, in order to assess 
      the ecological impact of macrodebris and its role as source of microplastics for 
      adjacent ecosystems. We also advocate the use of standard categories across studies, 
      based on those identified for surveying other coastal habitats. This review 
      highlights an alarming knowledge gap in extent, sources and overall impacts of 
      marine macrodebris, mainly constituted by plastic, on mangrove forests, which 
      hinders policy making to address this issue. Standardised, reliable and extended 
      research on this aspect of mangrove pollution is needed to manage and protect these 
      endangered vegetated coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) has been detected in marine, limnic, terrestrial, and atmospheric 
      environments. However, rivers are often only seen as transport paths for MPs from 
      inland sources to the oceans, although transport rates in rivers can hardly be 
      determined yet. MP in rivers can either be transported, or it settles to the bottom 
      of the river and either remains there or is remobilized again at higher flow 
      velocities. This remobilization, also known as erosion, depends on the critical 
      shear stress of a particle and is influenced by the particle properties and the 
      sediment bed. In this study, the critical shear stresses of 14 MP particles with 
      different shapes, densities, and particle sizes on different sediment beds were 
      experimentally determined and subsequently compared with the basic principles of 
      erosion from sediment transport. Critical shear stresses of the MP particles were 
      between 0.002 and 0.233 N/m(2), depending on particle and sediment properties. 
      Furthermore, the hiding-exposure effect was transferred to MPs and an equation was 
      developed to determine the critical shear stress of different MP particles on 
      natural sediment beds.

AB  - Despite Africa ranking top in mismanaged plastic waste, there is insufficient data 
      on the extent of microplastics and its interaction with other contaminants in its 
      ecosystems. Microplastics pollution has been documented globally, however, specific 
      data from the continent is crucial for accurate risk assessment and to drive 
      policies. We critically reviewed 56 articles from 1987 to 2020 and provide an 
      overview of the current knowledge of the abundance and distribution of microplastics 
      and associated contaminants in African aquatic systems and organisms. Most of the 
      studies were carried out in the marine environment and there is currently no 
      available data on the abundance of microplastic pollution in the African terrestrial 
      environment. We show that across all studies, 5-100% of all sampled aquatic 
      organisms contained microplastics. Concerning high levels of microplastics were 
      reported in fish from Egypt compared to other parts of Africa and the world. Across 
      all persistent organic pollutants sampled in microplastics, hopanes and phthalates 
      were present at high concentrations while sodium and zinc were high relative to 
      other trace metals reported. The most frequently occurring plastics were 
      polyethylene followed by polypropylene and polystyrene. We found that most of the 
      studies relied on visual inspection (52%) > FTIR (38%) > Raman spectroscopy 
      (5%) > Scanning electron microscopy (3%) > Differential scanning calorimetry (2%) 
      for identifying microplastics. Major gaps in sampling and identification techniques 
      which may have overestimated or underestimated the current levels were identified. 
      We discuss other research priorities and recommend solutions to address these issues 
      associated with microplastic pollution in Africa.

AB  - Plastic pollution represents a global concern for the biodiversity conservation, 
      ecosystem and public health. The polystyrene is one of the dominant pollutants in 
      both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. This work measured the hazardous nature of 
      100 nm micropolystyrene (MPS) using 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/L concentrations in 
      terms of oxidative stress, morphotoxicity and cytogenotoxicity in Allium cepa. The 
      results were compared with the positive control (PC) (400 mg/L chlorpyrifos). MPS 
      significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the root length while induced the production of 
      hydroxyl, superoxide radicals with a concomitant increase in DPPH scavenging 
      activity and lipid peroxidation as compared to the negative control. The significant 
      decrease in mitotic index with respect to the negative control (MI: 23.855 ± 5.336 
      %; lowest MI: 3.88 ± 1.042 %) showed the cytotoxic nature of MPS. Genotoxicity was 
      assessed by various chromosomal and nuclear aberrations. The highest 3.029 ± 0.403 % 
      (PC: 3.09 ± 0.535 %) chromosomal abnormality index and 2.31 ± 0.338 % (PC: 
      1.178 ± 0.095 %) nuclear abnormality index were observed. MPS down-regulated the 
      expression of plant CDKA encoding gene: cdc2, an important cell cycle regulator. The 
      overall results indicated that MPS could induce cytogenotoxicity through the 
      exacerbation of ROS production and inhibition of cdc2.

AB  - Soils are essential components of terrestrial ecosystems that experience strong 
      pollution pressure. Microplastic contamination of soils is being increasingly 
      documented, with potential consequences for soil biodiversity and function. 
      Notwithstanding, data on effects of such contaminants on fundamental properties 
      potentially impacting soil biota are lacking. The present study explores the 
      potential of microplastics to disturb vital relationships between soil and water, as 
      well as its consequences for soil structure and microbial function. During a 5-weeks 
      garden experiment we exposed a loamy sand soil to environmentally relevant nominal 
      concentrations (up to 2%) of four common microplastic types (polyacrylic fibers, 
      polyamide beads, polyester fibers, and polyethylene fragments). Then, we measured 
      bulk density, water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, soil aggregation, and 
      microbial activity. Microplastics affected the bulk density, water holding capacity, 
      and the functional relationship between the microbial activity and water stable 
      aggregates. The effects are underestimated if idiosyncrasies of particle type and 
      concentrations are neglected, suggesting that purely qualitative environmental 
      microplastic data might be of limited value for the assessment of effects in soil. 
      If extended to other soils and plastic types, the processes unravelled here suggest 
      that microplastics are relevant long-term anthropogenic stressors and drivers of 
      global change in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Tiny plastic particles considered as emerging contaminants have attracted 
      considerable interest in the last few years. Mechanical abrasion, photochemical 
      oxidation and biological degradation of larger plastic debris result in the 
      formation of microplastics (MPs, 1 μm to 5 mm) and nanoplastics (NPs, 1 nm to 1000 
      nm). Compared with MPs, the environmental fate, ecosystem toxicity and potential 
      risks associated with NPs have so far been less explored. This review provides a 
      state-of-the-art overview of current research on NPs with focus on currently 
      less-investigated fields, such as the environmental fate in agroecosystems, 
      migration in porous media, weathering, and toxic effects on plants. The co-transport 
      of NPs with organic contaminants and heavy metals threaten human health and 
      ecosystems. Furthermore, NPs may serve as a novel habitat for microbial 
      colonization, and may act as carriers for pathogens (i.e., bacteria and viruses). An 
      integrated framework is proposed to better understand the interrelationships between 
      NPs, ecosystems and the human society. In order to fully understand the sources and 
      sinks of NPs, more studies should focus on the total environment, including 
      freshwater, ocean, groundwater, soil and air, and more attempts should be made to 
      explore the aging and aggregation of NPs in environmentally relevant conditions. 
      Considering the fact that naturally-weathered plastic debris may have distinct 
      physicochemical characteristics, future studies should explore the environmental 
      behavior of naturally-aged NPs rather than synthetic polystyrene nanobeads.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are a class of emerging contaminants with diverse sizes. They 
      influence the behavior of pollutants in the environment and cause harmful effects on 
      organisms. To date, the size effects of MPs on the accumulation of organic 
      pollutants by terrestrial invertebrates remain unclear. Here, we study the impacts 
      and mechanisms of polystyrene MPs on the accumulation and elimination of 
      phenanthrene in earthworms. Results showed that larger-size MPs (10 and 100 µm) 
      facilitated the accumulation of phenanthrene by earthworms in the first week, 
      whereas 100 nm MPs inhibited the elimination of phenanthrene in earthworms 
      afterwards. Higher genotoxicity to earthworms was observed for co-exposure of 
      micron-size MPs and phenanthrene, and 10 µm MPs were detected at the highest 
      concentration and caused the most serious DNA damage to earthworm coelomocytes. 
      Biomarkers and their mRNA gene expression levels suggested that larger-size MPs 
      caused severer damage to earthworms, thus leading to increased accumulation of 
      phenanthrene by earthworms at the beginning. Moreover, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene 
      sequencing indicated that nano-size MPs significantly inhibited 
      phenanthrene-degrading bacteria in earthworms, resulting in the highest residual 
      concentration of phenanthrene. This study highlights the size effects of MPs and 
      their impacts on the accumulation of organic pollutants by terrestrial organisms.

AB  - Microplastics are a complex group of ubiquitous environmental contaminants of 
      emerging concern. These particles degrade slowly, release plasticizers, and can be 
      transferred between trophic levels. In aquatic systems, they have been identified 
      suspended in the water column, along shorelines, and within sediment. However, the 
      abundance and distribution of microplastics in vegetated wetlands, which are 
      transitional ecosystems between terrestrial and aquatic environments, are poorly 
      understood. Here we describe the spatial distribution of soil microplastics in 
      habitats of varying vegetation density in an urban tidal wetland. Samples were 
      wet-sieved, organic matter was oxidized using hydrogen peroxide, and microplastics 
      separated under a dissecting microscope, counted, and weighed. A fraction (n = 175) 
      were analyzed via FTIR for validation. Positive microplastics identification was 
      81%-93%. Dominant polymers were polystyrene (29%) and polyethylene and synthetic 
      rubber (both 8%). Average microplastic number to a 5-cm depth (23,200 ± 2,500 m(-2) 
      or 1,270 ± 150 kg(-1)) varied between habitat types, where mudflat, channel edge, 
      and drift line habitats all had significantly more total microplastics than the 
      interior of dense stands of vegetation, suggesting that emergent wetland plants are 
      a highly effective filter of microplastics. Microfibers were about eight times as 
      abundant as microfragments, and fibers and fragments differed in their distribution 
      patterns, with microfibers most abundant in vegetation-free mudflats and 
      microfragments in vegetated channel edges. Our results demonstrate that vegetated 
      wetlands are important locations for microplastic accumulation and that wetland 
      vegetation and hydrodynamics affect spatial distribution of microplastics between 
      habitats.

AB  - Plastic has been identified as an emerging contaminant in aquatic and terrestrial 
      ecosystems. Uncertainties remain concerning the amounts present in the environment 
      and the main responsible sources. In this study, the emissions of macro- and 
      microplastics have been mapped for seven polymers in Switzerland. The modeling is 
      based on a complete analysis of the flows from production and use to end-of-life 
      using probabilistic material flow analysis. We estimate that 94 ± 34 g/capita/year 
      of low-density polyethylene, 98 ± 50 g/cap/a of high-density polyethylene, 126 ± 43 
      g/cap/a of polypropylene, 24 ± 13 g/cap/a of polystyrene, 16 ± 12 g/cap/a of 
      expanded polystyrene, 65 ± 36 g/cap/a of polyvinyl chloride, and 200 ± 120 g/cap/a 
      of polyethylene terephthalate enter the Swiss environment. All polymers combined, 
      540 ± 140 and 73 ± 14 g/cap/a are emitted into soil as macroplastics and 
      microplastics, respectively, and 13.3 ± 4.9 and 1.8 ± 1.1 g/cap/a are emitted into 
      freshwater as macroplastics and microplastics, respectively. The leading emission 
      pathway is littering for both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Construction, 
      agriculture, and pre- and postconsumer processes cause important emissions of 
      microplastics into soils, and postconsumer processes, textiles, and personal care 
      products release most of the microplastics into waters. Because mass flows into 
      soils are predicted to be 40 times larger than those into waters, more attention 
      should be placed on this compartment. Our work also highlights the importance of 
      referring to specific polymers instead of just "plastics".

AB  - Diversification of reproductive mode is a major theme in animal evolution. 
      Vertebrate reproduction began in water, and terrestrial eggs evolved multiple times 
      in fishes and amphibians and in the amniote ancestor. Because oxygen uptake from 
      water conflicts with water retention in air, egg adaptations to one environment 
      typically preclude development in the other. Few animals have variable reproductive 
      modes, and no vertebrates are known to lay eggs both in water and on land. We report 
      phenotypic plasticity of reproduction with aquatic and terrestrial egg deposition by 
      a frog. The treefrog Dendropsophus ebraccatus, known to lay eggs terrestrially, also 
      lays eggs in water, both at the surface and fully submerged, and chooses its 
      reproductive mode based on the shade above a pond. Under unshaded conditions, in a 
      disturbed habitat and in experimental mesocosms, these frogs lay most of their egg 
      masses aquatically. The same pairs also can lay eggs terrestrially, on vegetation 
      over water, even during a single night. Eggs can survive in both aquatic and 
      terrestrial environments, and variable mortality risks in each may make oviposition 
      plasticity adaptive. Phylogenetically, D. ebraccatus branches from the basal node in 
      a clade of terrestrially breeding species, nested within a larger lineage of 
      aquatic-breeding frogs. Reproductive plasticity in D. ebraccatus may represent a 
      retained ancestral state intermediate in the evolution of terrestrial reproduction.

AB  - Distribution and ecological risks of Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are poorly studied 
      in estuarine environments in India. An attempt is made to chart the sources and 
      assess the ecological risk of six PAE congeners (∑(6)PAEs), present in dissolved and 
      particulate forms in a tropical ecosystem (Cochin Estuary, India). Terrestrial 
      input, as attested by a clear seasonality with substantial enrichment during monsoon 
      (2-28 μg/L and 31-1203 μg/g; dissolved and particulate PAEs respectively) and 
      post-monsoon (1-7 μg/L and 7-321 μg/g; dissolved and particulate PAEs respectively), 
      was identified as the primary source. DnBP (di-n-butyl phthalate) and DEHP 
      (diethylhexyl phthalate) were found to be the dominant species except for dissolved 
      PAEs at pre-monsoon season. Statistical analysis identified two major clusters, in 
      the ∑(6)PAEs, composed of medium to high molecular weight PAEs (derived from plastic 
      products) and low molecular weight PAEs (derived from cosmetic products). Calculated 
      Risk Quotient (RQ) indicated values indicated moderate to high ecological risk for 
      DnBP and DEHP congeners is a grim pointer to their detrimental effects on human 
      health through consumption of contaminated organisms. Although substantial 
      enrichment of suspended matter gets flushed out of the estuary during monsoon, there 
      is a net PAE accumulation in the estuary during post-monsoon following an increased 
      sedimentary restitution. Data of PAEs generated herein raises a challenge for 
      immediate enactment of statutory legislation to curb and regulate hazardous 
      contamination of estuaries by phthalic acid esters.

AB  - Microplastic contamination of aquatic ecosystems is a high priority research topic, 
      whereas the issue on terrestrial ecosystems has been widely neglected. At the same 
      time, terrestrial ecosystems under human influence, such as agroecosystems, are 
      likely to be contaminated by plastic debris. However, the extent of this 
      contamination has not been determined at present. Via Fourier transform infrared 
      (FTIR) analysis, we quantified for the first time the macro- and microplastic 
      contamination on an agricultural farmland in southeast Germany. We found 206 
      macroplastic pieces per hectare and 0.34 ± 0.36 microplastic particles per kilogram 
      dry weight of soil. In general, polyethylene was the most common polymer type, 
      followed by polystyrene and polypropylene. Films and fragments were the dominating 
      categories found for microplastics, whereas predominantly films were found for 
      macroplastics. Since we intentionally chose a study site where 
      microplastic-containing fertilizers and agricultural plastic applications were never 
      used, our findings report on plastic contamination on a site which only receives 
      conventional agricultural treatment. However, the contamination is probably higher 
      in areas where agricultural plastic applications, like greenhouses, mulch, or silage 
      films, or plastic-containing fertilizers (sewage sludge, biowaste composts) are 
      applied. Hence, further research on the extent of this contamination is needed with 
      special regard to different cultivation practices.

AB  - Identifying terrestrial sources of debris is essential to suppress the flow of 
      plastic to the ocean. Here, we report a novel source of debris to the marine 
      environment. From May 2016 to June 2018, we collected golf balls from coastal 
      environments associated with five courses in Carmel, California. Our 75 collections 
      recovered 39,602 balls from intertidal and nearshore environments adjacent to, or 
      downriver from, the golf courses. Combining our collections with concurrent efforts 
      of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the Pebble Beach Corporation, we 
      report the retrieval of 50,681 balls, totaling approximately 2.5 tons of debris. We 
      also examined decomposition patterns in the collected balls, which illustrate that 
      degradation and loss of microplastic from golf balls to the marine environment may 
      be of concern. Our findings will help to develop and direct mitigation procedures 
      for this region and others with coastal golf courses.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a global problem with great local and regional variability. 
      Plastic litter reaches beaches directly and indirectly through different pathways, 
      due to both terrestrial and marine pressures. In this study, we assess and 
      characterize meso and microplastic pollution on four Uruguayan oceanic beaches along 
      a gradient of tourist use within a complex regional coastal marine system. In Punta 
      del Diablo we found a total mean density of 106 items m(-2) of different debris 
      (pellets, fragments, and foams) with different polymeric compositions, and diverse 
      persistent bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (PAHs, PCBs, OCs, heavy metals). 
      However, the trend of plastic debris densities along this gradient was not what was 
      expected. Fabeiro, one of the sites furthest from the urban center, had the highest 
      total mean density of plastics (292 items m(-2)) suggesting that marine influences 
      (winds, currents, and beach orientation) have a preponderant role in the 
      distribution of micro and mesoplastics. Meanwhile, the density in the urban site 
      (Pueblo) was highest during summer (March, 201 items m(-2)), 200 times higher than 
      the density observed in winter (July, 1 item m(-2)). Although this difference could 
      be associated to the peak season (southern summer), the analysis of types of 
      plastics (171 pellets m(-2) vs. 8 cigarette butts m(-2)) suggested a predominance of 
      marine inputs. Seasonal changes in the configuration of the beaches due to natural 
      geomorphological dynamics imply alternating states (Source or Sink of debris) that 
      also affect the final density of plastics in the system. The relative importance of 
      both sources is highly variable throughout the year and understanding them may 
      directly improve beach management and stranded coastal plastic litter cleaning.

AB  - Synthetic polymers, commonly named plastics, are among the most widespread 
      anthropogenic pollutants of marine, limnic and terrestrial ecosystems. Disruptive 
      effects of plastics are known to threaten wildlife and exert effects on natural food 
      webs, but signs for and knowledge on plastic biodegradation are limited. 
      Microorganisms are the most promising candidates for an eventual bioremediation of 
      environmental plastics. Laboratory studies have reported various effects of 
      microorganisms on many types of polymers, usually by enzymatic hydrolysis or 
      oxidation. However, most common plastics have proved to be highly recalcitrant even 
      under conditions known to favour microbial degradation. Knowledge on environmental 
      degradation is yet scarcer. With this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of 
      the current knowledge on microbiological degradation of several of the most common 
      plastic types. Furthermore, we illustrate the analytical challenges concerning the 
      evaluation of plastic biodegradation as well as constraints likely standing against 
      the evolution of effective biodegradation pathways.

AB  - While the distribution and effects of microplastics (MPs) have been extensively 
      studied in aquatic systems, there exits little information on their occurrence in 
      the terrestrial environment and their potential impacts on human health. In the 
      present study, street dust and suspended dust were collected from the city and 
      county of Asaluyeh, Iran. Samples were characterized by various microscopic 
      techniques (fluorescence, polarized light, SEM) in order to quantify and classify 
      MPs and microrubbers (MRs) in the urban and industrial environments that are 
      potentially ingestible or inhalable by humans. In < 5-mm street dust retrieved from 
      15 sites, there were an average of 900 MPs and 250 MRs per 15 g of sample, with MPs 
      exhibiting a range of colours and sizes (<100 to >1000 μm). Most street dust samples 
      were dominated by spherical and film-like particles and MRs largely made up of 
      different sizes of black fragments and fibrous particulates. Airborne dust collected 
      daily over an eight-day period at two locations revealed the ubiquity of fibrous MPs 
      of sizes ranging from about 2 μm to 100 μm and an abundance of about 1 per m(-3). 
      These samples contained small MR fragments whose precise characteristics were more 
      difficult to define. Based on the median concentrations in street dust, estimates of 
      acute exposure through ingestion are about 5 and 15 MP d(-1) and 2 and 7 MR d(-1) 
      for construction workers and young children, respectively. Quantities of inhalable 
      particulates were more difficult to define but the potential toxicity of MPs and MRs 
      taken in by this route was evaluated from assays performed using particulates 
      isolated from street dusts in the presence of an artificial lung fluid. Both types 
      of particle exhibited oxidative potential, with MPs displaying consumptions of 
      different antioxidants that were comparable with corresponding values for a 
      reference urban particulate dust but lower than those for London ambient particulate 
      matter. Thus, MPs and MRs contribute towards the health impacts of urban and 
      industrial dusts but their precise roles remain unclear and warrant further study.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are contaminants of increasing concern; they are abundant, 
      ubiquitous and persistent over time, representing potential risks for organisms and 
      ecosystems. However, such risks are still virtually unknown for amphibians, despite 
      the particular attention that these organisms often receive because of their global 
      decline. We examined the effects of MPs (fluorescent, 10-μm polystyrene 
      microspheres) at different concentrations (from 0 to 10(3) particles mL(-1)) on 
      tadpoles of the common midwife toad, Alytes obstetricans, using a microcosm 
      experiment. We assessed MP effects on tadpole feeding, growth and body condition, as 
      well as their ingestion and egestion of MPs (estimated through fluorescence). 
      Additionally, we explored whether MPs became attached to periphyton (the main food 
      source for these tadpoles, thus potentially representing a major way of MP 
      ingestion), and the effect of MPs on periphyton growth (which may translate into 
      altered freshwater ecosystem functioning). Our results showed significant effects on 
      all the examined variables, and caused tadpole mortality at the highest 
      concentration; also, fluorescence indicated the presence of MPs in tadpoles, tadpole 
      faeces and periphyton. This suggests that MPs can be an important source of stress 
      for amphibians in addition to other pollutants, climate change, habitat loss or 
      chytrid infections, and that amphibians can be a major transfer path for MPs from 
      freshwater to terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) continue to proliferate and pollute aquatic and terrestrial 
      environments globally. The impacts of MP pollution on ecosystems and their 
      functioning remain poorly quantified, with most research hitherto focusing on marine 
      ecosystems. There is a paucity of information on the impacts of MPs in freshwater 
      ecosystems, despite the broad range of pathways through which MPs can proliferate 
      and the extensive range of species which actively ingest MPs in these systems. Of 
      particular interest are organisms that bridge aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The 
      present study thus examines the uptake, ontogenic transference and effect of 
      different concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 200 MPs mL(-1)) and sizes (2 and 15 μm) of 
      polystyrene MPs between aquatic and terrestrial life stages of Culex pipiens complex 
      mosquitoes. Both 2 and 15 μm MPs transferred from the aquatic larval to terrestrial 
      adult stage of Culex mosquitoes, and uptake correlated tightly with initial exposure 
      concentration. However, neither concentration nor size of MPs significantly 
      influenced mortality rates between the aquatic larval and terrestrial adult stage. 
      There was also no impact of MPs on the weight of emerging mosquito adults. We thus 
      demonstrate that MPs can be transferred ontogenically through organisms with complex 
      life histories, presenting a potential pathway for dispersal of MPs into terrestrial 
      environments. We also show that MPs exposure does not affect mortality rates between 
      life stages of freshwater Culex populations. This suggests that MPs do not impact 
      nutritional uptakes, with unhampered development to adulthood facilitating 
      subsequent dispersal of MPs aerially and between freshwater and terrestrial 
      habitats.

      training on land.

LID - 10.1242/jeb.213348 [doi]
AB  - Many amphibious fishes rely on terrestrial locomotion to accomplish essential daily 
      tasks, but it is unknown whether terrestrial exercise improves the locomotor 
      performance of fishes on land. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that terrestrial 
      exercise improves locomotion in amphibious fishes out of water as a result of 
      skeletal muscle remodeling. We compared the jumping performance of Kryptolebias 
      marmoratus before and after an exercise training regimen, and assessed the muscle 
      phenotype of control and exercise-trained fish. We found that exercise-trained fish 
      jumped 41% farther and 48% more times before reaching exhaustion. Furthermore, 
      exercise training resulted in the hypertrophy of red muscle fibers, and an increase 
      in red muscle capillarity and aerobic capacity. Lactate accumulation after jumping 
      indicates that white muscle is also important in powering terrestrial jumps. 
      Overall, skeletal muscle in K. marmoratus is highly responsive to terrestrial 
      exercise, and muscle plasticity may assist in the effective exploitation of 
      terrestrial habitats by amphibious fishes.

AB  - Synthetic microfibers are found virtually everywhere in the environment, but 
      emission pathways and quantities are poorly understood. By connecting regionalized 
      global datasets on apparel production, use, and washing with emission and retention 
      rates during washing, wastewater treatment, and sludge management, we estimate that 
      5.6 Mt of synthetic microfibers were emitted from apparel washing between 1950 and 
      2016. Half of this amount was emitted during the last decade, with a compound annual 
      growth rate of 12.9%. Waterbodies received 2.9 Mt, while combined emissions to 
      terrestrial environments (1.9 Mt) and landfill (0.6 Mt) were almost as large and are 
      growing. Annual emissions to terrestrial environments (141.9 kt yr-1) and landfill 
      (34.6 kt yr-1) combined are now exceeding those to waterbodies (167.2 kt yr-1). 
      Improving access to wastewater treatment is expected to further shift synthetic 
      microfiber emissions from waterbodies to terrestrial environments. Preventing 
      emissions at the source would therefore be a more effective mitigation measure.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the bioavailability and toxicity of metals (Cu and 
      Ni) in the soil containing polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs). The bioavailability 
      of the metals determined by the five-step chemical sequential extraction method 
      increased with the addition of MPs (0.1%, 1%, 10%) in the soil, which was confirmed 
      by the adsorption-desorption characteristics. To further examine the bioavailability 
      and toxicity of metals, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed to soil containing 
      Cu(2+) (100 mg/kg) or Ni(2+) (40 mg/kg) with different amounts (0.01%, 0.05%, and 
      0.1%) of PE-MPs for 21 days. The highest concentrations of Cu(2+) and Ni(2+) in 
      earthworms reached to 73.3 and 36.3 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, metal 
      concentrations in earthworms increased with MP contents in the soil, which was 
      consistent with the bioavailability measured by the sequential extraction method. 
      Furthermore, changes in biomarkers including peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and related 
      gene expression levels in earthworms suggested that the pollutants caused toxicity 
      to earthworms. Overall, MPs increased the bioavailability of metals in the soil and 
      the toxic effects to earthworms. These findings provide insights regarding the 
      impacts of MPs on the bioavailability of metals and the combined toxic effects of 
      these two kinds of pollutants on terrestrial animals.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) attract ever-increasing attention due to environmental concerns. 
      Nowadays, they are ubiquitous across ecosystems, and research demonstrates that the 
      origin is mainly terrestrial. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are a major source 
      of MPs, especially fibres, in water masses. This review is focused on understanding 
      the evolution and fate of microplastics during wastewater treatment processes with 
      the aim of identifying advanced technologies to eliminate microplastics from the 
      water stream. Among them, bioremediation has been highlighted as a promising tool, 
      but confinement of microorganisms inside the WWTP is still a challenge. The 
      potential for MPs bioremediation in WWTPs of higher aquatic eukaryotes, which offer 
      the advantages of low dispersion rates and being easy to contain, is reviewed. 
      Animals, seagrasses and macrophytes are considered, taking into account ecoethical 
      and biological issues. Necessary research and its challenges have been identified.

AB  - Plastic debris of all sizes has been detected in marine, terrestrial and freshwater 
      habitats. Effects of plastic debris on macrophytes have hardly been studied, despite 
      their importance in aquatic ecosystems. We provide the first experimental study 
      exploring nano- and microplastic effects on the growth of sediment-rooted 
      macrophytes. Myriophyllum spicatum and Elodea sp. were exposed to sediments amended 
      with six doses of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastic (50-190 nm, up to 3% sediment dry 
      weight) and PS microplastic (20-500 μm, up to 10% dry weight) under laboratory 
      conditions. Both macrophyte species were tested for changes in root and shoot dry 
      weight (DW), relative growth rate (RGR), shoot to root ratio (S:R), main shoot 
      length and side shoot length. Microplastics did not produce consistent dose-effect 
      relationships on the endpoints tested, except that main shoot length was reduced for 
      M. spicatum with increasing microplastic concentration. Nanoplastic significantly 
      reduced S:R for both macrophytes as a result of increased root biomass compared to 
      shoot biomass. Nanoplastic also caused a decrease in M. spicatum main shoot length; 
      however, shoot biomass was not affected. Elodea sp. side shoot length, root and 
      shoot biomass and RGR were positively correlated to the nanoplastic concentration. 
      All effects occurred at higher than environmentally realistic concentrations, 
      suggesting no immediate implications for ecological risks. Our study did not aim for 
      the elucidation of the exact mechanistic processes that cause the effects, however, 
      particle size seems to play an important factor. CAPSULE: Nano- and microplastics 
      affect growth of sediment-rooted macrophytes.

AB  - Although atmospheric microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous even on 
      untraversed mountains and have potential impacts on human health, little information 
      concerning their sampling methodology and transport is currently available. Until a 
      realistic quantification of suspended atmospheric microplastics (SAMPs) is obtained, 
      however, any potential health risk assessment for this pollutant will be open to 
      criticism for using an ambiguous dataset. To address this knowledge gap, in May 2019 
      a trial experiment was performed to explore the potential relationship between 
      sampling volume and SAMP abundance. A significant logarithmic regression between 
      SAMP abundance and the sampling volume of filtrated air was found and the sufficient 
      volume of filtrated air for accurate SAMP quantification was recommended. 
      Investigation results indicated that fibrous and fragment-shaped SAMPs comprised 91% 
      of all of the identified synthetic particles. Interestingly, for the first time, 
      plastic microbeads were also observed in the collected air, constituting 9% of the 
      all of the SAMPs by quantity. Spectral analysis revealed that these SAMPs consisted 
      of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), epoxy resin (EP), polyethylene (PE), alkyd 
      resin (ALK), rayon (RY), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polystyrene (PS). 
      PET, EP, PE, and ALK constituted the majority (90%) of all of the polymer types, 
      with quantitative percentages of 51%, 19%, 12%, and 8%, respectively. Based on our 
      numerical modeling simulation, the approximate transport flux of SAMPs during June 
      in Shanghai was estimated, ranging from 9.94 × 10(4) n/(m·d) to 
      6.52 × 10(5) n/(m·d), with a mean of 3.00 ± 1.58 × 10(5) n/(m·d). The goal of our 
      study was to provide an essential methodological aid for the accurate determination 
      of SAMPs in the environment and a better understanding of terrestrial microplastic 
      transport in megacities.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) contaminates terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric environments. 
      Although the number of river sampling studies with regard to MP concentrations is 
      increasing, comprehension of the predominant transport processes of MP in the 
      watercourse is still very limited. In order to gain a better process understanding, 
      around 500 physical experiments were conducted to shed more light on the effects of 
      particle shape, size and density on the rise and settling velocities of MP. The 
      determined velocities ranged between 0.39 cm/s for polyamide fibers (settling) and 
      31.4 cm/s for expanded polystyrene pellets (rise). Subsequently, the determined 
      velocities were compared with formulas from sediment transport and, as there were 
      large differences between theoretically and experimentally determined velocities, 
      own formulas were developed to describe settling and rise velocities of MP particles 
      with a large variety of shapes, sizes and densities. This study shows that MP 
      differs significantly from sediment in its behavior and that a transfer of common 
      sediment transport formulas should be treated with caution. Furthermore, the 
      established formulas can now be used in numerical simulations to describe the 
      settling and rising of MP more precisely.

TI  - Ecophysiological Response on Dehydration and Temperature in Terrestrial 
      Klebsormidium (Streptophyta) Isolated from Biological Soil Crusts in Central 
      European Grasslands and Forests.
PG  - 850-864
LID - 10.1007/s00248-016-0917-3 [doi]
AB  - The green algal genus Klebsormidium (Klebsormidiophyceae, Streptophyta) is a typical 
      member of biological soil crusts (BSCs) worldwide. Ecophysiological studies focused 
      so far on individual strains and thus gave only limited insight on the plasticity of 
      this genus. In the present study, 21 Klebsormidium strains (K. dissectum, K. 
      flaccidum, K. nitens, K. subtile) from temperate BSCs in Central European grassland 
      and forest sites were investigated. Photosynthetic performance under desiccation and 
      temperature stress was measured under identical controlled conditions. 
      Photosynthesis decreased during desiccation within 335-505 min. After controlled 
      rehydration, most isolates recovered, but with large variances between single 
      strains and species. However, all K. dissectum strains had high recovery rates 
      (>69%). All 21 Klebsormidium isolates exhibited the capability to grow under a wide 
      temperature range. Except one strain, all others grew at 8.5 °C and four strains 
      were even able to grow at 6.2 °C. Twenty out of 21 Klebsormidium isolates revealed 
      an optimum growth temperature >17 °C, indicating psychrotrophic features. Growth 
      rates at optimal temperatures varied between strains from 0.26 to 0.77 μ day(-1). 
      Integrating phylogeny and ecophysiological traits, we found no phylogenetic signal 
      in the traits investigated. However, multivariate statistical analysis indicated an 
      influence of the recovery rate and growth rate. The results demonstrate a high 
      infraspecific and interspecific physiological plasticity, and thus wide 
      ecophysiological ability to cope with strong environmental gradients. This might be 
      the reason why members of the genus Klebsormidium successfully colonize terrestrial 
      habitats worldwide.

AB  - Microplastic pollution is a growing problem for Turkey and other countries, but most 
      studies focus on the pollution in oceans and seas. To understand the relationship 
      between microplastics, fresh water, and terrestrial environment, we examined 
      Pelophylax ridibundus and Rana macrocnemis tadpoles that can inhabit a wide range of 
      both terrestrial and aquatic habitats, ecoregions and elevations, and that are 
      members of Ranidae family. We characterized microplastics (MPs) in sediments, 
      surface water, and tadpoles from the Rize province in northeastern of Turkey. The 
      content of MPs in sediments, surface water, and tadpoles, ranged 64.17-472.1 
      items/kg, 1-13 items/L and 302.62-306.69 items/g, respectively. In sediment samples, 
      polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the dominant pollutants; whereas, 
      nylon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were found in surface water. In tadpoles, 
      PET, nylon, and polyacrylic were the dominant MPs.

TI  - Accumulation of HOCs via Precontaminated Microplastics by Earthworm Eisenia fetida 
      in Soil.
PG  - 11220-11229
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.0c02922 [doi]
AB  - Soil is a primary sink for plastics, but the influence of microplastics as carriers 
      on terrestrial cycling of persistent contaminants is poorly understood as compared 
      to aquatic systems. Studies to date have disregarded the potential fact that 
      microplastics are generally contaminated before their entry into soil. In this 
      study, earthworm Eisenia fetida was incubated for 28 d in a soil amended with five 
      common types of microplastics precontaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
      and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to elucidate contaminant transfer. 
      Accumulation of HOCs in E. fetida varied greatly among different plastic types and 
      HOCs. The freely dissolved concentration (C(free)) of HOCs showed that desorption of 
      HOCs from microplastics into soil was closely related to plastic types and HOC 
      hydrophobicity and was much slower for polystyrene or polypropylene than 
      polyethylene. Biodynamic model analysis suggested that ingestion of microplastics 
      could act as a significant pathway for some microplastics, likely due to HOCs on the 
      plastics being in an "over-equilibrium" state. This was in contrast with mixing 
      clean microplastics into HOC-contaminated soil, where the microplastics decreased 
      bioaccumulation. Therefore, whether microplastics serve as facilitators or 
      inhibitors of HOC bioaccumulation depends on the fugacity gradient of HOCs between 
      microplastics and soil, which highlights the importance of considering the sequence 
      of contamination between the plastics and soil. These findings also question the 
      validity of short-term experiments because of the generally very slow partition 
      kinetics of HOCs on plastics.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) in natural environments have attracted lots of attention. 
      Although the quantity of MPs present in terrene is much higher than that in aquatic 
      environment, few studies have investigated the chemical behavior of MPs in 
      terrestrial environment. This study investigate the Cu(2+) (as a model heavy metal) 
      adsorption capacity of six kinds of MPs (polyamide-6 (PA), polyethylene (PE), 
      polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
      polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)) in batch adsorption experiments and the effects of 
      different soil environmental factors, including pH and the presence of cations and 
      low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs), as well as ultraviolet (UV) aging. The 
      Cu(2+) adsorption capacities of PA and PMMA were higher than those of other MPs and 
      their maximum equilibrium adsorption capacities (estimated by the Langmuir 
      adsorption equation) were 323.6 μg/g ± 38.2 and 41.03 ± 1.78 μg/g, respectively. The 
      Cu(2+) adsorption on MPs was affected by pH, and the greatest amount of Cu(2+) 
      adsorbed on PA and PMMA was observed at pH = 6 and pH = 7, respectively. The 
      presence of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) inhibited Cu(2+) adsorption by MPs, due to competition 
      for the adsorption sites. Moreover, Cu(2+) adsorption by MPs was affected by various 
      types of LMWOAs. The Cu(2+) adsorption on PA was significantly reduced by citric 
      acid, followed by oxalic acid, and oxalic acid was particularly evident for Cu(2+) 
      adsorption on PMMA. UV aging (200 h) had different effect on Cu(2+) adsorption on 
      MPs and it depends on the change of carbonyl index. Results demonstrate that soil 
      environmental factors can change the ability of different MPs to adsorb Cu(2+) and 
      affect the transport of pollutants as carriers.

AB  - This literature review was conducted to collect present data on microplastics 
      pollution in Iran's ecosystems. Most of the studies performed in aquatic environment 
      were conducted in Persian Gulf & Oman Sea (70%). The Persian Gulf, along with the 
      beaches of Bushehr and Hormozgan Provinces, are the most studied areas. Moreover, 
      most of the studies were conducted in aquatic environments and only four studies 
      were conducted in terrestrial environment (4/42). One study has assessed 
      microplastics in commercial salt and another study has reported the microplastics 
      presence in Iranian bottled mineral water brands. The investigation of microplastics 
      associated with biota was highlighted, customarily for fish species. Microplastics 
      were also present in urban wastewater samples in Sari and Bandar Abbas cities. Three 
      studies were performed in freshwater ecosystems until now (Haraz River, Anzali 
      wetland, and Taleqan dam). The need for further studies in this field still exists, 
      especially in terrestrial and freshwater compartments.

TI  - Responses of terrestrial polar arthropods to high and increasing temperatures.

LID - 10.1242/jeb.230797 [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial arthropods in the Arctic and Antarctic are exposed to extreme and 
      variable temperatures, and climate change is predicted to be especially pronounced 
      in these regions. Available ecophysiological studies on terrestrial ectotherms from 
      the Arctic and Antarctic typically focus on the ability of species to tolerate the 
      extreme low temperatures that can occur in these regions, whereas studies 
      investigating species plasticity and the importance of evolutionary adaptation to 
      periodically high and increasing temperatures are limited. Here, we provide an 
      overview of current knowledge on thermal adaptation to high temperatures of 
      terrestrial arthropods in Arctic and Antarctic regions. Firstly, we summarize the 
      literature on heat tolerance for terrestrial arthropods in these regions, and 
      discuss variation in heat tolerance across species, habitats and polar regions. 
      Secondly, we discuss the potential for species to cope with increasing and more 
      variable temperatures through thermal plasticity and evolutionary adaptation. 
      Thirdly, we summarize our current knowledge of the underlying physiological 
      adjustments to heat stress in arthropods from polar regions. It is clear that very 
      little data are available on the heat tolerance of arthropods in polar regions, but 
      that large variation in arthropod thermal tolerance exists across polar regions, 
      habitats and species. Further, the species investigated show unique physiological 
      adjustments to heat stress, such as their ability to respond quickly to increasing 
      or extreme temperatures. To understand the consequences of climate change on 
      terrestrial arthropods in polar regions, we suggest that more studies on the ability 
      of species to cope with stressful high and variable temperatures are needed.

AB  - Introduction: Gene-expression patterns and their upstream regulatory mechanisms 
      (e.g. epigenetic) are known to modulate plant acclimatability and thus tolerance to 
      heat stress. Within species, thermal plasticity (i.e. temperature-sensitive 
      phenotypic plasticity) and differential thermo-tolerance are recognized among 
      different genotypes, development stages, organs or tissues. Leaf age and lifespan 
      have been demonstrated to strongly affect photosynthetic thermo-tolerance in 
      terrestrial species, whereas there is no information available for marine plants. 
      Materials and Methods: Here, we investigated how an intense warming event affects 
      molecular and photo-physiological functions in the large-sized seagrass Posidonia 
      oceanica, at fine spatial resolution. Plants were exposed for one week at 34°C in a 
      controlled-mesocosm system. Subsequent variations in the expression of 12 target 
      genes and global DNA methylation level were evaluated in three leaf-age sections 
      (i.e. basal, medium and high) established along the longitudinal axis of youngest, 
      young and fully mature leaves of the shoot. Targeted genes were involved in 
      photosynthesis, chlorophyll biosynthesis, energy dissipation mechanisms, stress 
      response and programmed cell death. Molecular analyses paralleled the assessment of 
      pigment content and photosynthetic performance of the same leaf segments, as well as 
      of plant growth inhibition under acute warming. Results: Our data revealed, for the 
      first time, the presence of variable leaf age-dependent stress-induced epigenetic 
      and gene-expression changes in seagrasses, underlying photo-physiological and growth 
      responses to heat stress. An investment in protective responses and growth arrest 
      was observed in immature tissues; while mature leaf sections displayed a higher 
      ability to offset gene down-regulation, possibly through the involvement of DNA 
      methylation changes, although heat-induced damages were visible at 
      photo-physiological level. Discussion: Overall, mature and young leaf tissues 
      exhibited different strategies to withstand heat stress and thus a variable thermal 
      plasticity. This should be taken in consideration when addressing seagrass response 
      to warming and other stressors, especially in large-sized species, where sharp age 
      differences are present within and among leaves, and other gradients of 
      environmental factors (e.g. light) could be at play. Molecular and physiological 
      evaluations conducted only on adult leaf tissues, as common practice in seagrass 
      research, could give inadequate estimates of the overall plant state, and should not 
      be considered as a proxy for the whole shoot.

AB  - Microplastic (μPs) contamination represents a dramatic environmental problem 
      threatening both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Although several studies have 
      highlighted the presence of μPs in aquatic environments, the information regarding 
      their toxicity towards organisms is still scant. Moreover, most of the 
      ecotoxicological studies of μPs have focused on marine organisms, largely neglecting 
      the effects on freshwater species. The present study aimed at exploring the effects 
      caused by 21-days exposure to three concentrations (0.125, 1.25 and 12.5 μg/mL) of 
      two differently sized polystyrene microplastics (PμPs; 1 and 10 μm) to the 
      Cladoceran Daphnia magna. The ingestion/egestion capability of daphnids (<24 h) and 
      adults, the changes in individual growth and behavior, in terms of changes in 
      swimming activity, phototactic behavior and reproduction, were investigated. Both 
      particles filled the digestive tract of daphnids and adults within 24 h of exposure 
      at all the tested concentrations. Ingested PμPs remained in the digestive tract even 
      after 96 h in a clean medium. For both particles, an overall increase in body size 
      of adults was noted at the end of the exposure to the highest tested concentrations, 
      accompanied by a significant increase in swimming activity, in terms of distance 
      moved and swimming velocity, and by an alteration of the phototactic behavior. A 
      significant increase in the mean number of offspring after the exposure to the 
      highest PμPs concentrations of different size was recorded. Polystyrene μPs can 
      affect behavioral traits of D. magna leading to potentially harmful consequences on 
      population dynamics of this zooplanktonic species.

TI  - RemeDB: Tool for Rapid Prediction of Enzymes Involved in Bioremediation from 
      High-Throughput Metagenome Data Sets.
PG  - 1020-1029
LID - 10.1089/cmb.2019.0345 [doi]
AB  - Environmental pollution has emerged to be a major hazard in today's world. 
      Pollutants from varied sources cause harmful effects to the ecosystem. The major 
      pollutants across marine and terrestrial regions are hydrocarbons, plastics, and 
      dyes. Conventional methods for remediation have their own limitations and 
      shortcomings to deal with these environmental pollutants. Bio-based remediation 
      techniques using microbes have gained momentum in the recent past, primarily 
      ascribed to their eco-friendly approach. The role of microbial enzymes in 
      remediating the pollutants are well reported, and further exploration of microbial 
      resources could lead to discovery of novel pollutant degrading enzymes (PDEs). 
      Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies and metagenomics have 
      provided the impetus to explore environmental microbes for potentially novel 
      bioremediation enzymes. In this study, a tool, RemeDB, was developed for identifying 
      bioremediation enzymes sequences from metagenomes. RemeDB aims at identifying 
      hydrocarbon, dye, and plastic degrading enzymes from various metagenomic libraries. 
      A sequence database consisting of >30,000 sequences proven to degrade the major 
      pollutants was curated from various literature sources and this constituted the 
      PDEs' database. Programs such as HMMER and RAPSearch were incorporated to scan 
      across large metagenomic sequences libraries to identify PDEs. The tool was tested 
      with metagenome data sets from varied sources and the outputs were validated. RemeDB 
      was efficient to classify and identify the signature patterns of PDEs in the input 
      data sets.

AB  - There is evidence and serious concern that microplastics have reached the most 
      remote regions of the planet, but how far have they travelled in terrestrial 
      ecosystems? This study presents the first field-based evidence of plastic ingestion 
      by a common and central component of Antarctic terrestrial food webs, the 
      collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus. A large piece of polystyrene (PS) foam (34 × 31 
      × 5 cm) covered by microalgae, moss, lichens and microfauna was found in a fellfield 
      along the shores of the Fildes Peninsula (King George Island). The application of an 
      improved enzymatic digestion coupled with Fourier transform infrared microscopy 
      (µ-FTIR), unequivocally detected traces of PS (less than 100 µm) in the gut of the 
      collembolans associated with the PS foam and documented their ability to ingest 
      plastic. Plastics are thus entering the short Antarctic terrestrial food webs and 
      represent a new potential stressor to polar ecosystems already facing climate change 
      and increasing human activities. Future research should explore the effects of 
      plastics on the composition, structure and functions of polar terrestrial biota.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are now one of the major environmental problems due to the large 
      amount released in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as their diffuse 
      sources and potential impacts on organisms and human health. Still the molecular and 
      cellular targets of microplastics' toxicity have not yet been identified and their 
      mechanism of actions in aquatic organisms are largely unknown. In order to partially 
      fill this gap, we used a mass spectrometry based functional proteomics to evaluate 
      the modulation of protein profiling in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), one of 
      the most useful freshwater biological model. Mussels were exposed for 6 days in 
      static conditions to two different microplastic mixtures, composed by two types of 
      virgin polystyrene microbeads (size = 1 and 10 μm) each one. The mixture at the 
      lowest concentration contained 5 × 105 MP/L of 1 μm and 5 × 105 MP/L of 10 μm, while 
      the higher one was arranged with 2 × 106 MP/L of 1 μm and 2 × 106 MP/L of 10 μm. 
      Proteomics' analyses of gills showed the complete lack of proteins' modulation after 
      the exposure to the low-concentrated mixture, while even 78 proteins were 
      differentially modulated after the exposure to the high-concentrated one, suggesting 
      the presence of an effect-threshold. The modulated proteins belong to 5 different 
      classes mainly involved in the structure and function of ribosomes, energy 
      metabolism, cellular trafficking, RNA-binding and cytoskeleton, all related to the 
      response against the oxidative stress.

AB  - Around the coastline of the UK, macro-debris has been observed in average densities 
      of over 700 items per metre. Systematic beach-cleans were conducted at 35 sites 
      around the Scottish Orkney Islands, in order to quantify and categorise the level of 
      marine debris found there. Litter was collected from 100 m transects and categorised 
      by its material, broad source (terrestrial or marine) and potential sector source. 
      Variation between sites, and the relative contribution of pre-determined 
      environmental variables in influencing said variation, were analysed using the 
      "capscale" function for a canonical analysis of principle coordinates (CAP). 513 
      items/m were observed, (77% plastic), with "String/cord (<1cm diameter)" being the 
      most abundant and widely distributed litter type. 47% of macro-debris was attributed 
      to the fishing sector and < 10% to leisure, living and tourism-associated 
      activities. Conversely, the unique regional hydrodynamics must be examined further, 
      before the source of any given item can be categorically assigned.

AB  - The human foot is highly derived relative to that of other hominoids and therefore a 
      topic of intense research in paleoanthropology. While trabecular bone is thought to 
      be highly plastic in response to habitual behavior, knowledge of how trabecular 
      structure scale with body size is essential for making functional inferences from 
      trabecular bone morphology. Trabecular bone properties scale with negative allometry 
      in interspecific studies that includes a wide range of body size; however, 
      intraspecific scaling patterns often differ from interspecific trends. In this paper 
      we examine patterns of trabecular bone scaling in the calcaneus, talus, and first 
      metatarsal of four human populations with different subsistence strategies and 
      associated levels of terrestrial mobility. We report Bayesian linear regressions 
      between the natural logarithms of femoral head diameter and five standard trabecular 
      variables calculated in five spherical volumes of interest. We additionally report 
      regressions on population-specific z-scores of femoral head diameter and trabecular 
      variables as a way of placing the four populations on a common scale. Results show 
      that with increasing body size there is no change in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) 
      and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), a slight increase in trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp), 
      and a sharp decrease in connectivity density (Conn.D). Degree of anisotropy was 
      found to scale with positive allometry in the calcaneus, negative allometry in the 
      talar trochlea, and shows no relationship with femoral head diameter in the talar 
      and first metatarsal heads. These results show that scaling of the degree of 
      anisotropy can vary substantially within and between bones. Degree of anisotropy is 
      often used as a proxy for directionality in joint loading when interpreting 
      variation in trabecular structures of fossils and extant primates. Body size should 
      therefore be an important consideration when trabecular bone structure is used to 
      interpret function from fossil morphology.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution is everywhere. In terrestrial environments, microfibres 
      (MFs) generated from textile laundering are believed to form a significant component 
      of MPs entering soils, mainly through sewage sludge and compost applications. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the effect of MFs on a keystone soil organism. We 
      exposed the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris to soil with polyester MFs incorporated 
      at rates of 0, 0.1 and 1.0 %w/w MF for a period of 35 days (in the dark at 15 °C; 
      n = 4 for each treatment). Dried plant litter was applied at the soil surface as a 
      food source for the earthworms. We assessed earthworm vitality through mortality, 
      weight change, depurate production and MF avoidance testing. In addition, we 
      measured stress biomarker responses via the expression of metallothionein-2 (mt-2), 
      heat shock protein (hsp70) and superoxide dismutase (sod-1). Our results showed that 
      exposure and ingestion of MFs (as evidenced by subsequent retrieval of MFs within 
      earthworm depurates) were not lethal to earthworms, nor did earthworms actively 
      avoid MFs. However, earthworms in the MF1.0% treatment showed a 1.5-fold lower cast 
      production, a 24.3-fold increase in expression of mt-2 (p < 0.001) and a 9.9-fold 
      decline in hsp70 expression (p < 0.001). Further analysis of soil and MF samples 
      indicated that metal content was not a contributor to the biomarker results. Given 
      that burrowing and feeding behaviour, as well as molecular genetic biomarkers, were 
      modulated in earthworms exposed to MFs, our study highlights potential implications 
      for soil ecosystem processes due to MF contamination.

AB  - The presence of microplastics (MPs) and their effects have been widely investigated 
      in the aquatic environment, whereas the research done in the terrestrial environment 
      is incomparably lacking. MPs are considered a pollutant in soil on agricultural 
      land, where they can act as a vector for other pollutants, namely organic chemical 
      compounds, such as pesticides. In soil, presence of MPs is affecting the growth and 
      life of microorganisms in it. The interactions between two types of MPs and three 
      pesticides in the mixture with alluvial soil were studied. Adsorption of 
      acetamiprid, chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide in concentrations of 1, 5 and 
      10 mg L(-1) onto polyester fibres and polypropylene particles of 0.5-1 mm size was 
      studied at 1% and 5% (w/w) of their content in soil. Results showed that the 
      adsorption of pesticides was dependent on their octanol/water partition coefficient, 
      with the most highly adsorbed pesticide also being the most hydrophobic, regardless 
      of the type and form of MPs. Adsorption of pesticides onto MP particles was 
      confirmed in soil-MPs mixtures with 5% polypropylene and 5% polyester at all tested 
      pesticides' concentrations, proving that MPs in soil systems act as carriers to 
      pollutants. MPs in soil decreased the soil's intrinsic capacity to retain 
      pesticides, indicating the possibility of a greater mobility of pesticides on MPs 
      through the soil system.

      Actinobacterial species.

AB  - Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) polymer is mainly used in the production of plastic 
      bags and food packaging making up the largest volume of plastic pollutions. These 
      polymers are potential substrates for bacteria in the bioremediation process. In 
      this study, soil samples were collected from different plastic landfills in Iran and 
      subsequently enriched in specific media (polyethylene as carbon source) to increase 
      the population of LDPE-degrading bacteria. Seventeen PE-degrading bacteria, some 
      novel, were isolated from Iranian soil samples and identified using 16S rDNA gene 
      sequencing. These isolates were capable of degrading PE in a limited incubation 
      period without the need for physicochemical pretreatments and comprise mostly of 
      Actinobacteria which include the three genera of Streptomyces, Nocardia, and 
      Rhodococcus. The isolates belonged to 17 different species of gram-positive 
      Actinobacteria. In all, 11 species of the genus Streptomyces, 3 species of the genus 
      Rhodococcus, and 3 species of the genus Nocardia were identified. The isolates with 
      less than 99% 16S rRNA gene similarity to previously known species were suspected to 
      be new species. Various analyses (weight loss, SEM, FTIR, and tensile strength test) 
      to determine polyethylene biodegradation rate were carried out after a 60-day 
      incubation period. Analysis of polyethylene biodegradation elucidates that 
      Actinobacteria have a high ability for biodegradation of polyethylene-based 
      plastics. Streptomyces sp. IR-SGS-T10 showed the highest reduction in weight of the 
      LDPE film (1.58 mg/g/day) after 60 days of incubation without any pretreatments. 
      Rhodococcus sp. IR-SGS-T11 shows the best reduction in the tensile property of LDPE 
      film, while results from FTIR study for Streptomyces sp. IR-SGS-Y1 indicated a 
      significant change in structural analysis.

TI  - Plants and climate change: complexities and surprises.
PG  - 849-64

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) will influence all aspects of plant 
      biology over coming decades. Many changes in wild species have already been 
      well-documented as a result of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warming 
      climate and changing precipitation regimes. A wealth of available data has allowed 
      the use of meta-analyses to examine plant-climate interactions on more sophisticated 
      levels than before. These analyses have revealed major differences in plant response 
      among groups, e.g. with respect to functional traits, taxonomy, life-history and 
      provenance. Interestingly, these meta-analyses have also exposed unexpected 
      mismatches between theory, experimental, and observational studies. SCOPE: We 
      reviewed the literature on species' responses to ACC, finding ∼42 % of 4000 species 
      studied globally are plants (primarily terrestrial). We review impacts on phenology, 
      distributions, ecophysiology, regeneration biology, plant-plant and plant-herbivore 
      interactions, and the roles of plasticity and evolution. We focused on apparent 
      deviations from expectation, and highlighted cases where more sophisticated analyses 
      revealed that unexpected changes were, in fact, responses to ACC. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found that conventionally expected responses are generally well-understood, and that 
      it is the aberrant responses that are now yielding greater insight into current and 
      possible future impacts of ACC. We argue that inconclusive, unexpected, or 
      counter-intuitive results should be embraced in order to understand apparent 
      disconnects between theory, prediction, and observation. We highlight prime examples 
      from the collection of papers in this Special Issue, as well as general literature. 
      We found use of plant functional groupings/traits had mixed success, but that some 
      underutilized approaches, such as Grime's C/S/R strategies, when incorporated, have 
      improved understanding of observed responses. Despite inherent difficulties, we 
      highlight the need for ecologists to conduct community-level experiments in systems 
      that replicate multiple aspects of ACC. Specifically, we call for development of 
      coordinating experiments across networks of field sites, both natural and man-made.

AB  - One of the main sources of plastic pollution in agricultural fields is the plastic 
      mulch used by farmers to improve crop production. The plastic mulch is often not 
      removed completely from the fields after harvest. Over time, the plastic mulch that 
      is left of the fields is broken down into smaller particles which are dispersed by 
      the wind or runoff. In the Region of Murcia in Spain, plastic mulch is heavily used 
      for intensive vegetable farming. After harvest, sheep are released into the fields 
      to graze on the vegetable residues. The objective of the study was to assess the 
      plastic contamination in agricultural soil in Spain and the ingestion of plastic by 
      sheep. Therefore, three research questions were established: i) What is the plastic 
      content in agricultural soils where plastic mulch is commonly used? ii) Do livestock 
      ingest the microplastics found in the soil? iii) How much plastic could be 
      transported by the livestock? To answer these questions, we sampled top soils 
      (0-10 cm) from 6 vegetable fields and collected sheep faeces from 5 different herds. 
      The microplastic content was measured using density separation and visual 
      identification. We found ~2 × 10(3) particles∙kg(-1) in the soil and ~10(3) 
      particles∙kg(-1) in the faeces. The data show that plastic particles were present in 
      the soil and that livestock ingested them. After ingesting plastic from one field, 
      the sheep can become a source of microplastic contamination as they graze on other 
      farms or grasslands. The potential transport of microplastics due to a herd of 1000 
      sheep was estimated to be ~10(6) particles∙ha(-1)∙y(-1). Further studies should 
      focus on: assessing how much of the plastic found in faeces comes directly from 
      plastic mulching, estimating the plastic degradation in the guts of sheep and 
      understanding the potential effects of these plastic residues on the health of 
      livestock.

AB  - Microplastics occur widely in the terrestrial environment and they currently occur 
      in organic fertilizers applied to agricultural land. However, there is little 
      information available on the accumulation of microplastics in soils fertilized over 
      the long term. Here, we investigate the characteristics of microplastics in both pig 
      manure and soil following long-term manure application in an attempt to assess their 
      accumulation and the potential risk to agricultural soils of repeated application of 
      pig manure. Microplastics were separated from soil and pig manure samples using a 
      sequential flow separation and flotation method. The abundances of microplastics 
      were 16.4 ± 2.7 and 43.8 ± 16.2 particles kg(-1) in control plots (CK, no manure 
      applied) and plots amended annually with pig manure for 22 years (PM), respectively. 
      The microplastics (especially fragments) were significantly enriched in PM-amended 
      soil compared with the control plots. The average annual abundance of microplastics 
      was 1250 ± 640 particles kg(-1) in manure. Interestingly, the type and polymer 
      composition of microplastics were very similar in the soil and manure. Differences 
      in color and particle size indicate that microplastics sourced from pig manure may 
      be gradually weathered and degraded after incorporation into the soil. The average 
      accumulation rate of microplastics in the agricultural soil with long-term 
      application of pig manure was estimated to be 3.50 ± 1.71 million particles ha(-1) 
      a(-1). The microplastics in the manured soil displayed complicated weathered 
      surfaces. The presence of carbonyl groups suggests that the weathered microplastics 
      in soil may have the potential to adsorb contaminants.

AB  - Microplastic (MPs) pollution in the aquatic and terrestrial environments has caught 
      many attentions in the scientific literatures. Currently, no information is 
      available about MPs pollution in Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world. This 
      study indicates the first report on the MPs pollution in the sediments of the 
      southern Caspian coastal zones, northern Iran. Density separation method was 
      conducted on 17 surficial sediments. The combination of observation techniques 
      including SEM-EDS analysis, polarized light microscopy and Raman micro-spectroscopy 
      were used to identify MPs. The abundance and size of microplastics in the samples 
      ranged between 25 and 330 items/kg and 250-500 μm, respectively. Fibers constituted 
      the most common MPs shape and polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) were major 
      polymer types in the samples. The distribution of MPs in the study area reflected a 
      patchy and irregular spatial pattern implying that the higher MPs concentration are 
      near mouth of permanent rivers and in the regions with higher level of the fishing 
      and tourism activities. The results showed the wide occurrence of MPs in the 
      sediments of the world's largest lake which extend the knowledge on MPs pollution in 
      the marine system. We also recommend further research on microplastics in different 
      compartments of Caspian Sea to inform policy discussions and the development of 
      appropriate management responses.

AB  - Differences among individuals within species affect community and ecosystem 
      processes in many systems, and may rival the importance of differences between 
      species. Intraspecific variation consists of both plastic and genetic components 
      that are regulated by different processes and operate on different time scales. 
      Therefore, probing which mechanisms can affect traits sufficiently strongly to 
      affect ecosystem processes is fundamental to understanding the consequences of 
      individual variation. We find that a dominant deciduous tree of Pacific Northwest 
      riparian ecosystems, red alder, exhibits strong and synergistic responses to 
      nutrient resources and herbivory stress. These induced responses, which include 
      shifting nutrient and plant secondary metabolite composition, have cascading effects 
      on aquatic ecosystem function. Defense responses suppress leaf litter decomposition 
      in small streams, thus altering the rate of energy capture for one of the most 
      abundant terrestrial carbon sources entering aquatic systems. We find that alder 
      responses to herbivory stress largely depend on availability of soil nutrients, with 
      modification of the highly cytotoxic diarylheptanoid group of secondary metabolites 
      being favored in nutrient-poor environments and modification of the typically 
      dose-dependent ellagitannins being favored in nutrient-rich environments. 
      Importantly, these findings identify traits for herbivore resistance in alder trees 
      and demonstrate that plastic responses occurring within a species and over short 
      time scales substantially alter a key function of an adjacent ecosystem. 
      Furthermore, demonstrating plasticity among alder secondary metabolites lends 
      insight into this system, in which decomposer communities are known to adjust to the 
      secondary chemistry of local alder trees to facilitate rapid decomposition of 
      locally derived leaf litter.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are characterized by small particle sizes (<5 mm) and are widely 
      distributed in the soil environment. To date, little research has been conducted on 
      investigating the effects of MPs on the soil microbial community, which plays a 
      vital role in biogeochemical cycling. In the present study, we investigate the 
      influence of two particle sizes of MPs on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its 
      relative functional groups, fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and the bacterial and 
      fungal communities in fertilized soil. The results showed that a 5% concentration of 
      MPs had no significant effect on soil DOC, whereas the formation of aromatic 
      functional groups was accelerated. In fertilized soil, the existence of MPs 
      decreased the global warming potential (GWP) as a result of a reduction in N(2)O 
      emissions during the first three days. A potential mechanism for this reduction in 
      N(2)O emissions might be that MPs inhibited the phylum Chloroflexi, Rhodoplanes 
      genera, and increased the abundance of Thermoleophilia on day 3. An increase in 
      N(2)O emissions was observed on day 30, mainly due to the acceleration of the 
      NO(3)(-) reduction and a decrease in the abundance of Gemmatimonadacea. The CH(4) 
      uptake was significantly correlated with Hyphomicrobiaceae on day 3 and 
      Rhodomicrobium on day 30. In soil with MPs, Actinobacteria replaced Proteobacteria 
      as the dominant phylum. Larger MPs increased the richness (Chao1) and 
      abundance-based coverage estimators (ACE) and diversity (Shannon) of the bacterial 
      community on day 3, whereas these decreased on day 30. The richness and diversity of 
      the fungal community were also reduced on days 3 and 30. Smaller MPs increased the 
      community richness and diversity of both bacterial and fungal communities in 
      fertilized soil. Our findings suggest that MPs have selective effects on microbes 
      and can potentially have a serious impact on terrestrial biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - The presence and persistence of microplastics in the environment is increasingly 
      recognized, however, how they are distributed throughout environmental systems 
      requires further understanding. Seabirds have been identified as vectors of chemical 
      contaminants from marine to terrestrial environments, and studies have recently 
      identified seabirds as possible vectors of plastic pollution in the marine 
      environment. However, their role in the distribution of microplastic pollution in 
      the Arctic has yet to be explored. We examined two species of seabirds known to 
      ingest plastics: northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis; n = 27) and thick-billed 
      murres (Uria lomvia; n = 30) as potential vectors for the transport of microplastics 
      in and around breeding colonies. Our results indicated anthropogenic particles in 
      the faecal precursors of both species. Twenty-four anthropogenic particles were 
      found in the fulmar faecal precursor samples (M = 0.89, SD = 1.09; 23 fibres and one 
      fragment), and 10 anthropogenic particles were found in the murre faecal precursor 
      samples (M = 0.33, SD = 0.92; 5 fibres, 4 fragments, and one foam). Through the use 
      of bird population surveys and the quantification of anthropogenic particles found 
      in the faecal precursors of sampled seabirds from the same colony, we estimate that 
      fulmars and murres may deposit between 3.3 (CI(boot) 1.9 × 10(6)-4.9 × 10(6)) and 
      45.5 (CI(boot) 9.1 × 10(6)-91.9 × 10(6)) million anthropogenic particles, 
      respectively, per year into the environment during their breeding period at these 
      colonies. These estimates indicate that migratory seabirds could be contributing to 
      the distribution and local hotspots of microplastics in Arctic environments, 
      however, they are still likely a relatively small source of plastic pollution in 
      terms of mass in the environment and may not contribute as much as other reported 
      sources such as atmospheric deposition in the Arctic.

TI  - Pollution Characteristics of Microplastics in Soils in Southeastern Suburbs of 
      Baoding City, China.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants that exist in different environmental 
      media. Because of their wide range and large potential environmental hazards, they 
      have attracted widespread attention in recent years. At present, the research on MP 
      is mostly concentrated on the water ecosystems, and the impact on soil ecosystems is 
      less studied. In this study, 12 typical soil samples from southeastern suburbs of 
      Baoding city were investigated and characterized by time-of-flight secondary ion 
      mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) combined with mass high resolution mode and positive 
      and negative ion imaging mode. Four types of MPs, poly (propylene) (PP), poly (vinyl 
      chloride) (PVC), poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), and poly (amide 6) (PA6), were 
      quickly identified, of which PET and PA6 accounted for the largest proportion of 
      both up to 30.2%; the particle size of the obtained MPs ranged from 0 to 35 μm, of 
      which the proportion of <10 μm MPs was more than 26.3%, while that of 20-25 μm and 
      25-35 μm MPs was relatively small (17.83% and 9.3%, respectively). Risk assessment 
      results of the MP in the soil showed that the risk level of MPs in the non-ferrous 
      metal industrial parks and in concentrated with small workshops areas is relatively 
      high, and attention should be paid to such areas. In addition, the study provides a 
      reference method for the investigation and risk assessment of MPs in terrestrial 
      soils, coastal beaches, and sediments.

      (Streptophyta) from a terrestrial and a freshwater habitat.
PG  - 213-220
AB  - The genus Klebsormidium (Klebsormidiales, Streptophyta) has a worldwide distribution 
      in terrestrial habitats. In the present study, we focused on two strains of 
      Klebsormidium flaccidum, the type species of the genus. The isolates used in this 
      study were isolated from a soil and freshwater habitat. Photosynthetic activity was 
      evaluated under different controlled gradients of light, temperature and 
      desiccation. The data clearly indicate that both isolates of K. flaccidum exhibit 
      conspicuously different photosynthetic response patterns to photon fluence rate, 
      temperature and desiccation, and thus can be related to their different habitats. 
      Although both strains represent the same species, their physiological response 
      patterns to abiotic gradients, as well as their morphology differed to some extent, 
      indicating high phenotypic plasticity of K. flaccidum, which was maintained even 
      after long-term culture and thus can be explained by the formation of 
      physiologically distinct ecotypes.

TI  - Transformation of Riccia fluitans, an Amphibious Liverwort Dynamically Responding to 
      Environmental Changes.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21155410 [doi]
LID - 5410
AB  - The colonization of land by streptophyte algae, ancestors of embryophyte plants, was 
      a fundamental event in the history of life on earth. Bryophytes are early 
      diversifying land plants that mark the transition from freshwater to terrestrial 
      ecosystems. The amphibious liverwort Riccia fluitans can thrive in aquatic and 
      terrestrial environments and thus represents an ideal organism to investigate this 
      major transition. Therefore, we aimed to establish a transformation protocol for R. 
      fluitans to make it amenable for genetic analyses. An Agrobacterium transformation 
      procedure using R. fluitans callus tissue allows to generate stably transformed 
      plants within 10 weeks. Furthermore, for comprehensive studies spanning all life 
      stages, we demonstrate that the switch from vegetative to reproductive development 
      can be induced by both flooding and poor nutrient availability. Interestingly, a 
      single R. fluitans plant can consecutively adapt to different growth environments 
      and forms distinctive and reversible features of the thallus, photosynthetically 
      active tissue that is thus functionally similar to leaves of vascular plants. The 
      morphological plasticity affecting vegetative growth, air pore formation, and 
      rhizoid development realized by one genotype in response to two different 
      environments makes R. fluitans ideal to study the adaptive molecular mechanisms 
      enabling the colonialization of land by aquatic plants.

AB  - The concern about microplastic (a group of polymers) in the environment may cause us 
      to overlook a more substantial problem: microplastics will fragment into 
      nanoplastics. This fragmentation will lead to a high number of nanoplastics 
      particles. Such nanoplastic can be taken up by cells, as opposed to microscale 
      particles that are either not or to much less extend taken up. Fragmentation into 
      nano will also release materials previously safely embedded in the polymer. We here 
      present results from 25 OECD/ISO in vivo hazard tests, and beyond, e.g. extended 
      exposure duration, with Enchytraeus crypticus, using pristine nano-scale materials 
      (NMs) [CuO, Fe(2)O(3), Organic Pigment, MWCNT], fragmented products (polymers) with 
      these NMs embedded in the matrices (FP_NM), and fragmented polymers without NMs (FP) 
      [covering the 4 major plastic types: Acrylic, Polyethylene, Polypropylene and 
      Epoxy]. For example, MWCNTs induced a highly significant population decrease after 
      extended period of 60 days, despite having no impact after 28 days' exposure, the 
      standard OECD duration. We conclude, that the standard tests were not suitable to 
      evaluate hazards of these plastic fragments, weathering/ageing of materials is 
      recommended, and extension of test duration can add value to the testing of NMs. We 
      must refocus the concern to testing with polymers (not only "plastics"), from 
      micro-to nano-polymers, and from aquatic to terrestrial environments.

      distribution, analytical methods and ecological impacts.
PG  - 240-274
LID - 10.1039/d0em00312c [doi]
AB  - Increased production and use of plastics has resulted in growth in the amount of 
      plastic debris accumulating in the environment, potentially fragmenting into smaller 
      pieces. Fragments <5 mm are typically defined as microplastics, while fragments <0.1 
      μm are defined as nanoplastics. Over the past decade, an increasing number of 
      studies have reported the occurrence and potential hazards of plastic particles in 
      the aquatic environment. However, less is understood about plastic particles in the 
      terrestrial environment and specifically how much plastic accumulates in soils, the 
      possible sources, potential ecological impacts, interaction of plastic particles 
      with the soil environment, and appropriate extraction and analytical techniques for 
      assessing the above. In this review, a comprehensive overview and a critical 
      perspective on the current state of knowledge on plastic pollution in the soil 
      environment is provided: detailing known sources, occurrence and distribution, 
      analytical techniques used for identification and quantification and the ecological 
      impacts of particles on soil. In addition, knowledge gaps are identified along with 
      suggestions for future research.

AB  - Plastic has created a new man-made ecosystem called plastisphere. The plastic pieces 
      including microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) have emerged as a global 
      concern due to their omnipresence in ecosystems and their ability to interact with 
      the biological systems. Nevertheless, the long-term impacts of MPs on biotic and 
      abiotic resources are not completely understood, and existing evidence suggests that 
      MPs are hazardous to various keystones species of the global biomes. MP-contaminated 
      ecosystems show reduced floral and faunal biomass, productivity, nitrogen cycling, 
      oxygen-generation and carbon sequestration, suggesting that MPs have already started 
      affecting ecological biomes. However, not much is known about the influence of MPs 
      towards the ecosystem services (ESs) cascade and its correlation with the 
      biodiversity loss. MPs are perceived as a menace to the global ecosystems, but their 
      possible impacts on the provisional, regulatory, and socio-economic ESs have not 
      been extensively studied. This review investigates not only the potentiality of MPs 
      to perturb the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic biomes, but also the 
      associated social, ecological and economic repercussions. The possible long-term 
      fluxes in the ES network of terrestrial and aquatic niches are also discussed.

AB  - Plants associate with a wide range of beneficial fungi in their roots which 
      facilitate plant mineral nutrient uptake in exchange for carbohydrates and other 
      organic metabolites. These associations play a key role in shaping terrestrial 
      ecosystems and are widely believed to have promoted the evolution of land plants. To 
      establish compatibility with their host, root-associated fungi have evolved diverse 
      colonization strategies with distinct morphological, functional and genomic 
      specializations as well as different degrees of interdependence. They include 
      obligate biotrophic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), and facultative biotrophic 
      ectomycorrhizal (ECM) interactions but are not restricted to these 
      well-characterized symbioses. There is growing evidence that root endophytic 
      associations, which due to their inconspicuous nature have been often overlooked, 
      can be of mutualistic nature and represent important players in natural and managed 
      environments. Recent research into the biology and genomics of root associations 
      revealed fascinating insight into the phenotypic and trophic plasticity of these 
      fungi and underlined genomic traits associated with biotrophy and saprotrophy. In 
      this review we will consider the commonalities and differences of AM and ECM 
      associations and contrast them with root endophytes.

TI  - The influences of environmental change and development on leaf shape in Vitis.
PG  - 676-688
LID - 10.1002/ajb2.1460 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE: The size and shape (physiognomy) of woody, dicotyledonous angiosperm leaves 
      are correlated with climate. These relationships are the basis for multiple 
      paleoclimate proxies. Here we test whether Vitis exhibits phenotypic plasticity and 
      whether physiognomy varies along the vine. METHODS: We used Digital Leaf Physiognomy 
      (DiLP) to measure leaf characters of four Vitis species from the USDA Germplasm 
      Repository (Geneva, New York) from the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 leaf-growing seasons, 
      which had different environmental conditions. RESULTS: Leaf shape changed 
      allometrically through developmental stages; early stages were more linear than 
      later stages. There were significant differences in physiognomy in the same 
      developmental stage between the growing seasons, and species had significant 
      differences in mean physiognomy between growing seasons. Phenotypic plasticity was 
      defined as changes between growing seasons after controlling for developmental stage 
      or after averaging all developmental stages. Vitis amurensis and V. riparia had the 
      greatest phenotypic plasticity. North American species exhibited significant 
      differences in tooth area:blade area. Intermediate developmental stages were most 
      likely to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, and only V. amurensis exhibited phenotypic 
      plasticity in later developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: Leaves have variable 
      phenotypic plasticity along the vine. Environmental signal was strongest in 
      intermediate developmental stages. This is significant for leaf 
      physiognomic-paleoclimate proxies because these leaves are likely the most common in 
      leaf litter and reflect leaves primarily included in paleoclimate reconstructions. 
      Early season and early developmental stages have the potential to be confounding 
      factors but are unlikely to exert significant influence because of differential 
      preservation potential.

AB  - Contamination by plastic debris has been documented in most regions of the world, 
      but their occurrence in high mountain areas has not been investigated to date. Here 
      we present the first report of the occurrence and amount of microplastic in any 
      terrestrial glacier environment. In the supraglacial debris of the Forni Glacier 
      (Italian Alps), we observed the occurrence of (mean ± standard error) 74.4 ± 28.3 
      items kg(-1) of sediment (dry weight). This amount is within the range of 
      variability of microplastic contamination observed in marine and coastal sediments 
      in Europe. Most plastic items were made by polyesters, followed by polyamide, 
      polyethylene and polypropylene. We estimated that the whole ablation area of Forni 
      Glacier should host 131-162 million plastic items. Microplastic can be released 
      directly into high elevation areas by human activities in the mountain or be 
      transported by wind to high altitude. The occurrence of microplastic on Forni 
      Glacier may be due to the gathering of debris coming from the large accumulation 
      area into the relatively smaller ablation area of the glacier, as a consequence of 
      its flow and melting.

AB  - Human pressure exerts a significant influence on animals and the environment. One of 
      its consequences, plastic pollution is considered one of the major threats to fauna 
      as well as a significant conservation issue. In this research, we examined the 
      global pattern of one example of avian behavior in response to pollution-namely, the 
      incorporation of anthropogenic materials into nests-as well as the existing 
      knowledge on this subject. Based on 25 articles, we studied 51 populations, 
      involving 24 bird species, and checked 10,790 nests; as a result, we found that 
      incorporation of debris is correlated with increasing human influence on the 
      environment, measured as the Human Footprint Index. Moreover, the probability of 
      debris incorporation is higher in terrestrial than in marine species. We also 
      identified knowledge bias in favor of marine as opposed to terrestrial species: 
      namely, marine species attract more scientific attention than terrestrial. 
      Furthermore, research approaches to these two ecosystems differ. Undeniably, the 
      factors which influence debris incorporation by birds, the scale of this behavior, 
      and particular forms of use of debris in bird nests are aspects which require 
      long-term standardized research. This is the first global review paper on debris 
      incorporation by birds to demonstrate a close link to human pressure as a driver.

AB  - Terrestrial environments are subject to extensive pollution by plastics and, based 
      on the slow degradation of plastics, are likely to act as long term sinks for 
      microplastic debris. Currently the hazards of microplastics in soil and the 
      potential impacts on soil organisms is poorly understood. Particularly the role of 
      particle characteristics, such a size or polymer type, in dose-response 
      relationships for microplastics is not known. The aim of this study was to assess 
      the ingestion and toxicity of nylon (polyamide) particles, in three different size 
      ranges, to Enchytraeus crypticus in a soil exposure. Effects were also compared with 
      those of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) particles, in a single size range. Nylon particle 
      ingestion was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy, with greatest ingestion for 
      particles in the smallest size range (13-18 μm). To investigate how particle size 
      affected survival and reproduction, E. crypticus were exposed to nylon particles in 
      two well-defined size ranges (13-18 and 90-150 μm) and concentrations of 20, 50, 90 
      and 120 g/kg (2-12% w/w). An intermediate nylon size range (63-90 μm) and a larger 
      sized PVC particle (106-150 μm), both at 90 g/kg, were also tested. Survival was not 
      affected by either of the polymer types or sizes. Reproduction was significantly 
      reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, by the nylon particles at high exposure 
      concentrations (>90 g/kg). Smaller size ranges (13-18 μm) had a greater effect 
      compared to larger size ranges (>63 μm), with a calculated EC(50) for the 13-18 μm 
      size range of 108 ± 8.5 g/kg. This greater hazard could be qualitatively linked with 
      the ingestion of a greater number of smaller particles. This study highlights the 
      potential for toxic effects of plastics in small size ranges to soil organisms at 
      high exposure concentrations, providing understanding of the hazards microplastics 
      may pose in the terrestrial environment.

AB  - In this study, for the first time, acute and chronic toxicity caused by four 
      different kinds of microplastics: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), 
      polyvinylchloride (PVC), and a commercial mixture (PE + PVC) on Lepidium sativum 
      were evaluated. Parameters considered were: i) biometric parameters (e.g. percentage 
      inhibition of seed germination, plant height, leaf number and fresh biomass 
      productions); and ii) oxidative stress (e.g. levels of hydrogen peroxide, 
      glutathione, and ascorbic acid). On plants exposed to chronic stress chlorophylls, 
      carotenoids, aminolaevulinic acid, and proline productions were, also, evaluated. 
      PVC resulted the most toxic than other plastic materials tested. This study 
      represents the first paper highlighting microplastics are able to produce oxidative 
      burst in tested plants and could represent an important starting point for future 
      researches on biochemical effects of microplastic in terrestrial environments such 
      as agroecosystems.

TI  - Bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of polychlorinated biphenyls by aquatic and 
      terrestrial insects to tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor).
PG  - 1017-25
AB  - Insectivorous passerines often bioaccumulate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) via 
      trophic transfer processes. Tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) frequently are used 
      for estimating PCB bioaccumulation, yet the focus on specific trophic links between 
      contaminated sediment and bird has been limited. Bioaccumulation of PCBs from 
      sediment to tree swallows was examined with focus on trophic pathways by 
      simultaneously examining PCBs in emergent aquatic and terrestrial insects and gut 
      contents of nestlings. Total PCB concentrations increased from sediment (123.65 +/- 
      15.93 microg/kg) to tree swallow nestlings (2,827.76 +/- 505.67 microg/kg), with 
      emergent aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, and gut content samples having 
      intermediate concentrations. Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) varied 
      among congeners for tree swallow nestlings and for male and female Chironomus spp. 
      For nestlings, the highest BSAF was for the mono-ortho-substituted congener 118. 
      Nestling biomagnification values were similar for gut contents and female Chironomus 
      spp., suggesting this diet item may be the main contributor to the overall PCB 
      transfer to nestlings. However, gut content samples were highly variable and, on a 
      PCB congener pattern basis, may have been influenced by other taxa, such as 
      terrestrial insects. Considering dietary plasticity of many insectivorous birds, the 
      present study suggests that a variety of potential food items should be considered 
      when examining PCB accumulation in insectivorous passerines.

AB  - The increasing pollution of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems with plastic debris 
      leads to the accumulation of microscopic plastic particles of still unknown amount. 
      To monitor the degree of contamination, analytical methods are urgently needed, 
      which help to quantify microplastics (MP). Currently, time-costly purified materials 
      enriched on filters are investigated both by micro-infrared spectroscopy and/or 
      micro-Raman. Although yielding precise results, these techniques are time consuming, 
      and are restricted to the analysis of a small part of the sample in the order of few 
      micrograms. To overcome these problems, we tested a macroscopic dimensioned 
      near-infrared (NIR) process-spectroscopic method in combination with chemometrics. 
      For calibration, artificial MP/ soil mixtures containing defined ratios of 
      polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, and polystyrene with 
      diameters < 125 μm were prepared and measured by a process FT-NIR spectrometer 
      equipped with a fiber-optic reflection probe. The resulting spectra were processed 
      by chemometric models including support vector machine regression (SVR), and partial 
      least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Validation of models by MP mixtures, 
      MP-free soils, and real-world samples, e.g., fermenter residue, suggests a reliable 
      detection and a possible classification of MP at levels above 0.5 to 1.0 mass% 
      depending on the polymer. The benefit of the combined NIRS chemometric approach lies 
      in the rapid assessment whether soil contains MP, without any chemical pretreatment. 
      The method can be used with larger sample volumes and even allows for an online 
      prediction and thus meets the demand of a high-throughput method.

AB  - Marine litter is a pollution problem affecting thousands of marine species in all 
      the world's seas and oceans. Marine litter, in particular plastic, has negative 
      impacts on marine wildlife primarily due to ingestion and entanglement. Since most 
      marine mammal species negatively interact with marine litter, a first workshop under 
      the framework of the European Cetacean Society Conference, was held in 2017 to bring 
      together the main experts on the topic of marine mammals and marine litter from 
      academic and research institutes, non-governmental organisations, foundations and 
      International Agreements. The workshop was devoted to defining the impact of marine 
      litter on marine mammals by reviewing current knowledge, methodological advances and 
      new data available on this emerging issue. Some case studies were also presented 
      from European waters, such as seals and cetaceans in the North, Baltic, and 
      Mediterranean Seas. Here, we report the main findings of the workshop, including a 
      discussion on the research needs, the main methodological gaps, an overview of new 
      techniques for detecting the effects of marine litter (including microplastics) on 
      marine mammals and, also, the use of citizen science to drive awareness. The final 
      recommendations aim to establish priority research, to define harmonised methods to 
      detect marine litter and microplastics, enforce networking among institutions and 
      support data sharing. The information gathered will enhance awareness and 
      communication between scientists, young people, citizens, other stakeholders and 
      policy makers, and thereby facilitate better implementation of international 
      directives (e.g., the Marine Strategy Framework Directive) in order to answer the 
      question about the actual status of our oceans and finding solutions.

TI  - Environmental effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, UV radiation and 
      interactions with climate change: UNEP Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, 
      update 2019.
PG  - 542-584
LID - 10.1039/d0pp90011g [doi]
AB  - This assessment, by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Environmental 
      Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP), one of three Panels informing the Parties to the 
      Montreal Protocol, provides an update, since our previous extensive assessment 
      (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci., 2019, 18, 595-828), of recent findings of current and 
      projected interactive environmental effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, 
      stratospheric ozone, and climate change. These effects include those on human 
      health, air quality, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and 
      materials used in construction and other services. The present update evaluates 
      further evidence of the consequences of human activity on climate change that are 
      altering the exposure of organisms and ecosystems to UV radiation. This in turn 
      reveals the interactive effects of many climate change factors with UV radiation 
      that have implications for the atmosphere, feedbacks, contaminant fate and 
      transport, organismal responses, and many outdoor materials including plastics, 
      wood, and fabrics. The universal ratification of the Montreal Protocol, signed by 
      197 countries, has led to the regulation and phase-out of chemicals that deplete the 
      stratospheric ozone layer. Although this treaty has had unprecedented success in 
      protecting the ozone layer, and hence all life on Earth from damaging UV radiation, 
      it is also making a substantial contribution to reducing climate warming because 
      many of the chemicals under this treaty are greenhouse gases.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution is an emerging environmental and health concern. MPs 
      have been extensively observed in the aquatic environment, yet rarely investigated 
      in the terrestrial ecosystem, especially in relation to health risks. To evaluate 
      potential MPs pollution in land-dwelling animal medicine materials, we collected 20 
      types of small animal-based medicinal materials and 10 types of available fresh 
      terrestrial animals from eight different regions in China. MPs were found in all 
      medicinal materials with an average incidence rate of 94.67%. The abundance of MPs 
      was in the range of 1.80 ± 0.38 to 7.80 ± 0.83 items/individual or 1.59 ± 0.33 to 
      43.56 ± 9.22 items/g (dry weight), with polymer distribution by polyethylene 
      terephthalate (40.45%), rayon (30.64%), polyethylene (10.11%), nylon (7.35%), 
      polypropylene (5.93%), and polyvinyl chloride (5.52%). The majority of MPs were 
      microfibers (84.68%), with 15.32% of fragments. Moreover, MPs were directly observed 
      in the intestine, detected in all ten types of fresh medicinal animals with the 
      abundance of 0.83 ± 0.35 to 3.42 ± 0.46 items/individual. Furthermore, significant 
      positive correlations (R: 0.32-0.99, p < 0.05) of MPs characteristics were found 
      between medicinal materials and fresh animals, including shape, size, color, and 
      polymer distribution of MPs. The results support that MPs in the medicinal materials 
      were likely derived from living animals. This study demonstrates the prevalence of 
      MPs in animal-based, traditional medicinal materials, and also suggests widespread 
      MPs pollution in terrestrial environments and latent health risks.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that microplastics (MPs) can transport phthalate esters 
      (PAEs) into the tissues of mice. However, the influence of MPs on accumulation of 
      PAEs and the combined toxicity need profound investigation. In this study, the 
      bioaccumulation of PAEs and reproductive toxicity due to contaminated MPs exposure 
      were investigated. After exposure to PAE-contaminated MPs for 30 days, significantly 
      increased accumulation of PAE was observed in the liver and gut but not in the 
      testis, which are ascribed to the distribution of MPs in tissues. Herein, most 
      micro-size MPs accumulated in the gut and liver, while only a few nano-size MPs 
      entered the Sertoli cells. Compared with virgin MPs and PAEs alone, PAE-contaminated 
      MPs induced enhanced reproductive toxicities manifested by greater alterations in 
      sperm physiology and spermatogenesis. The enhanced toxicities were also confirmed by 
      the testicular transcriptomic alterations and aggravated oxidative stress induced by 
      PAE-contaminated MPs. These aggravated reproductive toxicities were not caused 
      solely by PAE, but may also be caused by the sensitization effect of oxidative 
      stress induced by MPs. Our results highlight the potential reproductive toxicity on 
      male terrestrial mammals due to co-exposure of MPs and plastic additives and provide 
      valuable insights into the mechanism of combined toxicity of MPs and other 
      pollutants.

AB  - In developing countries, there are needs for scientific basis to sensitize 
      communities on the problems arising from improper solid waste deposition and the 
      acute and long-term consequences for areas receiving immobilized pollutants. In 
      Nigeria, as in many other African countries, solid waste disposal by way of open 
      dumping has been the only management option for such wastes. Herein, we have 
      highlighted the challenges of solid waste deposit and management in developing 
      countries, focusing on contaminants of emerging concern and leaching into the 
      environment. We have analyzed sediments and run-off water samples from a solid waste 
      dumping site in Owerri, Nigeria for organic load and compared these with data from 
      representative world cities. Learning from previous incidents, we intend to 
      introduce some perspective for awareness of contaminants of emerging concerns such 
      as those with potential endocrine disrupting activities in wildlife and humans. 
      Qualitative and quantitative data obtained by gas chromatography and mass 
      spectrometric analysis (GC-MS) provide an overview on lipophilic and semi-polar 
      substances released from solid waste, accumulated in sediments and transported via 
      leachates. The chromatograms of the full scan analyses of the sediment extracts 
      clearly point to contamination related to heavy oil. The homologous series of 
      n-alkanes with chain lengths ranging between C16 and C30, as well as detected 
      polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds such as anthracene, phenanthrene, 
      fluoranthene and pyrene support the assumption that diesel fuel or high boiling 
      fractions of oil are deposited on the site. Targeted quantitative analysis for 
      selected compounds showed high concentration of substances typically released from 
      man-made products such as plastics, textiles, household and consumer products. 
      Phthalate, an integral component of plastic products, was the dominant compound 
      group in all sediment samples and run-off water samples. Technical nonylphenols 
      (mixture of isomers), metabolites of non-ionic surfactants 
      (nonylphenol-polyethoxylates), UV-filter compound ethyl methoxy cinnamate (EHMC) and 
      bisphenol A (BPA) were particularly determined in the sediment samples at high μg/kg 
      dry weight concentration. Measuring contaminants in such areas will help in 
      increasing governmental, societal and industrial awareness on the extent and 
      seriousness of the contamination both at waste disposal sites and surrounding 
      terrestrial and aquatic environments.

AB  - The role of rivers as a major transport pathway for all sizes of plastic debris into 
      the ocean is widely recognized. Global modelling studies ranked the Changjiang River 
      as the largest contributor of plastic waste to the marine environment, but these 
      estimates were based on insufficient empirical data. To better understand the role 
      of rivers in delivering terrestrial plastic debris to the ocean, the spatial and 
      temporal patterns of microplastics (MP) in the Changjiang Estuary (CE) and the East 
      China Sea (ECS) were studied based on surface water samples in February, May, and 
      July 2017. A total of 3225 MP (60-5000 μm) were identified by Fourier-transform 
      infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. MP abundance in July was higher than in February and 
      May due to higher river discharge. Density stratification in CE significantly 
      influenced the surface MP abundances. A temporal accumulation zone within the 
      river-sea interface for plastics was indicated by stations with apparently higher 
      abundances in the river plume. Fibers were the most common MP (>80%) over three 
      months. Small MP (<1000 μm) composed 75.0% of the total plastics on average. The 
      average mass of MP was 0.000033 g/particle, which was two orders of magnitude lower 
      than the empirical mass in literature. Without considering tidal effects, we 
      estimate 16-20 trillion MP particles, weighing 537.6-905.9 tons, entered the sea 
      through the surface water layer of the Changjiang River in 2017. These findings of 
      this study provide reliable information on MP waste in a large river, which should 
      be considered in further studies for estimating the riverine plastic loads.

AB  - The toxicological effects of microplastics in the soil environment have gradually 
      attracted widespread attention, while less is known about the influence of 
      microplastics on plants. The growth of wheat, photosynthetic pigment content, 
      soluble protein content, and the antioxidant enzyme activities of leaves were 
      investigated to explore the toxic effects of microplastics on wheat (Triticum 
      aestivum). In this study, 100 nm and 5 μm polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) were 
      used for soil culture treatment combined with hydroponic growth. The results showed 
      that in hydroponic experiment, high concentrations (200 mg·L(-1)) of PS-MPs 
      significantly inhibited the elongation of wheat roots and stems, and 5 μm PS-MPs 
      showed a greater toxicity effect than 100 nm PS-MPs. Roots and stem length 
      inhibition rates were 67.15% and 56.45%, respectively. In the soil culture tests, 10 
      mg·kg(-1) PS-MPs had the most significant effect on wheat growth. Within the test 
      content range (0-100 mg·kg(-1)), with an increase in PS-MPs exposure, the content of 
      photosynthetic pigment and soluble protein in wheat leaves increased first and then 
      decreased. This indicated that PS-MPs damaged the photosynthetic pathway of wheat 
      leaves and inhibited protein synthesis. SOD activity decreased, and CAT decreased 
      first and then increased, indicating that the possible mechanism of toxicity to 
      wheat involves oxidative stress. The results provide a basis for the ecological risk 
      assessment of microplastics in the soil environment.

AB  - As one type of the most widespread and long-lasting anthropogenic contaminants, 
      microplastics have become a global environmental concern. While numerous studies 
      have demonstrated effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms, the potential 
      influence on terrestrial faunas is relatively less known, even though soil is a 
      primary recipient and sink of plastics. In this study, earthworm Eisenia fetida was 
      exposed to different levels (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20% d.w.) of polyethylene (PE, 
      ≤300 μm) and polystyrene (PS, ≤250 μm) particles in an agricultural soil to evaluate 
      the oxidative stress. Fluorescence imaging, after dying with Nile Red, clearly 
      indicated the ingestion of PE and PS particles by E. fetida. Exposure to PE or PS 
      particles at the highest rate (20%) for 14 d significantly (p < 0.05) increased the 
      activity of catalase and peroxidase and the level of lipid peroxidation, while 
      inhibited the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase in 
      E. fetida. However, no discernible effect was detected at amendment rates ≤10% for 
      the majority of biochemical endpoints, suggesting that microplastic-induced 
      oxidative stress would not occur in E. fetida under most environmental conditions. 
      The influence of microplastics on bioaccumulation of PAHs and PCBs was also 
      evaluated in E. fetida exposed to different levels (0, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10% d.w.) of 
      PE and PS particles. The tissue concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were reduced in the 
      presence of microplastics at amendment rates ≥1%, suggesting that microplastics did 
      not act as a carrier to enhance contaminant uptake. This was attributed to 
      competitive sorption of microplastics for contaminants and the specific feeding 
      behavior of earthworm. Biodynamic model analysis confirmed that ingestion of 
      microplastics contributed negligibly to contaminant bioaccumulation. Findings of 
      this study suggested that under environmentally relevant conditions, microplastics 
      should not cause significant toxic effects to E. fetida, nor enhance its 
      accumulation of hydrophobic contaminants.

AB  - Accurate data on microplastic occurrence in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are a 
      basic requirement for microplastic risk assessment and management. Existing analysis 
      techniques like Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) 
      spectroscopy imaging are still time-consuming and depend on laborious sample 
      preparation. Therefore, we investigate the potential of time-resolved 
      photoluminescence spectroscopy as an alternative technique to identify plastic 
      materials, and, for the first time determine the photoluminescence lifetime of a 
      series of polymers and several non-plastic samples typically found in a marine 
      environment. The obtained photoluminescence lifetimes can be used to distinguish 
      between plastic and natural materials. Furthermore, they allow us to identify 
      distinct types of plastics. Therefore, the described approach has the potential to 
      identify materials either as a stand-alone technique or for pre-characterization of 
      sample materials for otherwise time-consuming analytical methods such as Raman 
      spectroscopy or FT-IR spectroscopy.

      first time. The total OPE concentration (∑OPE) in sediments was in the range of 
      5263-34,232 pg/g (dry weight), with an average value of 12,796 pg/g. Generally, 
      there was a higher abundance of non-halogenated OPEs than halogenated OPEs and aryl 
      OPEs, with tributyl phosphate, tris (2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, and 
      tri-(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate being the main components. The ∑OPE concentrations 
      in the western coastal and northern sampling sites were relatively high. The results 
      indicated that OPEs in the study region originated mainly from terrestrial river 
      inputs and local emission sources, as well as exogenous influxes by ocean currents.

AB  - Although microplastic (MP) pollution in freshwater systems is gaining attention, our 
      knowledge of its distribution in small waterbodies is scarce. Small waterbodies are 
      freshwater habitats to many species, including amphibians, that are vulnerable to MP 
      pollution. This study analyzed the distribution and characteristics of MPs in 25 
      small waterbodies from the Yangtze River Delta, China. MPs were detected in surface 
      water, sediment, and tadpoles with abundances ranging from 0.48 to 21.52 items 
      L(-1), 35.76 to 3185.33 items kg(-1), and 0 to 2.73 items individual(-1) (0 to 
      168.48 items g(-1)), respectively. The dominant shape and polymer of MPs in water 
      and tadpole samples were polyester (PES) fibers, and polypropylene (PP) fibers and 
      fragments were dominant in sediment samples. In addition, MPs were primarily <0.5 mm 
      in length in all samples. Tadpole length was positively correlated to the number of 
      MPs detected. The abundance, shape, and polymer distribution of MPs in tadpoles 
      resembled that of water rather than sediment, suggesting that tadpoles likely take 
      up MPs from the surrounding water. This study demonstrated that MPs are abundant in 
      these small waterbodies and are ingested by resident tadpoles. This may suggest a 
      pathway of MP entry into aquatic and terrestrial food webs.

TI  - Minimal genomes of mycoplasma-related endobacteria are plastic and contain 
      host-derived genes for sustained life within Glomeromycota.
PG  - 7791-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1501676112 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota) colonize roots of the majority of 
      terrestrial plants. They provide essential minerals to their plant hosts and receive 
      photosynthates in return. All major lineages of AMF harbor endobacteria classified 
      as Mollicutes, and known as mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE). Except for their 
      substantial intrahost genetic diversity and ability to transmit vertically, 
      virtually nothing is known about the life history of these endobacteria. To 
      understand MRE biology, we sequenced metagenomes of three MRE populations, each 
      associated with divergent AMF hosts. We found that each AMF species harbored a 
      genetically distinct group of MRE. Despite vertical transmission, all MRE 
      populations showed extensive chromosomal rearrangements, which we attributed to 
      genetic recombination, activity of mobile elements, and a history of plectroviral 
      invasion. The MRE genomes are characterized by a highly reduced gene content, 
      indicating metabolic dependence on the fungal host, with the mechanism of energy 
      production remaining unclear. Several MRE genes encode proteins with domains 
      involved in protein-protein interactions with eukaryotic hosts. In addition, the MRE 
      genomes harbor genes horizontally acquired from AMF. Some of these genes encode 
      small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteases specific to the SUMOylation systems 
      of eukaryotes, which MRE likely use to manipulate their fungal host. The extent of 
      MRE genome plasticity and reduction, along with the large number of horizontally 
      acquired host genes, suggests a high degree of adaptation to the fungal host. These 
      features, together with the ubiquity of the MRE-Glomeromycota associations, 
      emphasize the significance of MRE in the biology of Glomeromycota.

AB  - Microplastic research in recent years has shown that small plastic particles are 
      found almost everywhere we look. Besides aquatic and terrestrial environments, this 
      also includes aquatic species intended for human consumption and several studies 
      have reported their prevalence in other food products and beverages. The scientific 
      as well as public debate has therefore increasingly focused on human health 
      implications of microplastic exposure. However, there is a big discrepancy between 
      the magnitude of this debate and actual scientific findings, which have merely shown 
      the presence of microplastics in certain products. While plastics can undoubtedly be 
      hazardous to human health due to toxicity of associated chemicals or as a 
      consequence of particle toxicity, the extent to which microplastics in individual 
      food products and beverages contribute to this is debatable. Considering the 
      enormous use of plastic materials in our everyday lives, microplastics from food 
      products and beverages likely only constitute a minor exposure pathway for plastic 
      particles and associated chemicals to humans. But as this is rarely put into 
      perspective, the recent debate has created a skewed picture of human plastic 
      exposure. We risk pulling the focus away from the root of the problem: the way in 
      which we consume, use and dispose of plastics leading to their widespread presence 
      in our everyday life and in the environment. Therefore we urge for a more careful 
      and balanced discussion which includes these aspects.

AB  - There is a growing concern regarding the toxic effects of terrestrial nanoplastic 
      contaminants. However, an all-encompassing phenotyping- and omics-based strategy for 
      the toxicity assessment of nanoplastics with different surface properties on soil 
      living organisms remains to be established. Herein, we devised a comprehensive 
      phenotyping and multi-omic profiling method to examine the molecular disturbance of 
      nanopolystyrene (PS)-exposed Caenorhabditis elegans. The exposure time was 24 h with 
      either 1 μg/mL or 10 μg/mL of PS. We found that PS considerably affected the 
      reproduction and locomotion, as well as increased the oxidative stress of worms 
      regardless of their surface properties. Nevertheless, each type of PS affected the 
      metabolome and lipidome of the nematodes differently. Uncharged PS (PS-N) triggered 
      significant metabolic disturbances, whereas the metabolic influences from PS-NH(2) 
      and PS-COOH were subtle. The dysregulated transcriptome profiles of PS-N were 
      strongly associated with the metabolic pathways. Besides, the altered expression of 
      several genes associated with autophagy and longevity was observed. Collectively, we 
      demonstrated that comprehensive phenotyping and omics-based profiling establish a 
      practical framework that allows us to gain deeper insights into the maladaptive 
      consequences of PS in nematodes. It can be utilized for the evaluation of other 
      environmental contaminants in the terrestrial ecosystem.

AB  - Global plastic pollution has been a serious problem since many years and micro 
      (nano) plastics (MNPs) have gained attention from researchers around the world. This 
      is because MNPs able to exhibit toxicology and interact with potentially toxic 
      elements (PTEs) in the environment, causing soil toxicity. The influences of MNPs on 
      the soil systems and plant crops have been overlooked despite that MNPs can 
      accumulate in the plant root system and generate detrimental impacts to the 
      terrestrial environments. The consumption of these MNPs-contaminated plants or 
      fruits by humans and animals will eventually lead to health deterioration. The 
      identification and measurement of MNPs in various soil samples is challenging, 
      making the understanding of the fate, environmental and ecological of MNPs in 
      terrestrial ecosystem is limited. Prior to sample assessment, it is necessary to 
      isolate the plastic particles from the environment samples, concentrate the plastic 
      particles for analysis purpose to meet detection limit for analytical instrument. 
      The isolation and pre-concentrated steps are challenging and may cause sample loss. 
      Herein, this article reviews MNPs, including their fate in the environment and toxic 
      effects exhibited towards soil microorganisms, plants and humans along with the 
      interaction of MNPs with PTEs. In addition, various analysis methods of MNPs and 
      management of MNPs as well as the crucial challenges and future research studies in 
      combating MNPs in soil system are also discussed.

AB  - Charophyte green algae are a paraphyletic group of freshwater and terrestrial green 
      algae, comprising the classes of Chlorokybophyceae, Coleochaetophyceae, 
      Klebsormidiophyceae, Zygnematophyceae, Mesostigmatophyceae, and Charo- phyceae. 
      Zygnematophyceae (Conjugating green algae) are considered to be closest algal 
      relatives to land plants (Embryophyta). Therefore, they are ideal model organisms 
      for studying stress tolerance mechanisms connected with transition to land, one of 
      the most important events in plant evolution and the Earth's history. In 
      Zygnematophyceae, but also in Coleochaetophyceae, Chlorokybophyceae, and 
      Klebsormidiophyceae terrestrial members are found which are frequently exposed to 
      naturally occurring abiotic stress scenarios like desiccation, freezing and high 
      photosynthetic active (PAR) as well as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Here, we 
      summarize current knowledge about various stress tolerance mechanisms including 
      insight provided by pioneer transcriptomic and proteomic studies. While formation of 
      dormant spores is a typical strategy of freshwater classes, true terrestrial groups 
      are stress tolerant in vegetative state. Aggregation of cells, flexible cell walls, 
      mucilage production and accumulation of osmotically active compounds are the most 
      common desiccation tolerance strategies. In addition, high photophysiological 
      plasticity and accumulation of UV-screening compounds are important protective 
      mechanisms in conditions with high irradiation. Now a shift from classical chemical 
      analysis to next-generation genome sequencing, gene reconstruction and annotation, 
      genome-scale molecular analysis using omics technologies followed by 
      computer-assisted analysis will give new insights in a systems biology approach. For 
      example, changes in transcriptome and role of phytohormone signaling in 
      Klebsormidium during desiccation were recently described. Application of these 
      modern approaches will deeply enhance our understanding of stress reactions in an 
      unbiased non-targeted view in an evolutionary context.

AB  - Microplastics have become a contaminant of increasing concern in soils. Although 
      biodegradable plastics were considered as alternatives of traditional plastics, some 
      evidence showed that biodegradable plastics might produce more microplastics. Until 
      now, the effect of biodegradable microplastics on soil functions and processes, as 
      well as microbial communities is uncertain. Based on high throughput sequencing, 
      enzymatic activity assay and dynamic analysis of soil carbon and nitrogen, we 
      investigated the effects of biodegradable polylactic acid microplastics (PLA MPs) on 
      soil microbiota and related ecological processes under conditions of high or low 
      carbon content. The results showed that PLA MPs had no significant effect on the 
      overall diversity and composition of bacterial communities or related ecosystem 
      functions and processes. However, co-occurrence network analysis revealed that PLA 
      MPs impacted the interactions between constituent species, which might have legacy 
      effect on soil bacterial communities and functions. Our data also revealed that PLA 
      MPs could trade off the priming effect of carbon source. Our results provided an 
      integrated picture in understanding the effects of PLA MPs on soil microbes, 
      properties and ecological functions, which will help to further understand the 
      effects of MPs on terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Remarkable insensitivity of acorn ant morphology to temperature decouples the 
      evolution of physiological tolerance from body size under urban heat islands.

LID - 10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.102426 [doi]
AB  - Environmental temperature can alter body size and thermal tolerance, yet the effects 
      of temperature rise on the size-tolerance relationship remain unclear. Terrestrial 
      ectotherms with larger body sizes typically exhibit greater tolerance of high (and 
      low) temperatures. However, while warming tends to increase tolerance of high 
      temperatures through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change, warming tends to 
      decrease body size through these mechanisms and thus might indirectly contribute to 
      worse tolerance of high temperatures. These contrasting effects of warming on body 
      size, thermal tolerance, and their relationship are increasingly important in light 
      of global climate change. Here, we used replicated urban heat islands to explore the 
      size-tolerance relationship in response to warming. We performed a common garden 
      experiment with a small acorn-dwelling ant species collected from urban and rural 
      populations across three different cities and reared under five laboratory rearing 
      temperatures from 21 to 29 °C. We found that acorn ant body size was remarkably 
      insensitive to laboratory rearing temperature (ant workers exhibited no phenotypic 
      plasticity in body size across rearing temperature) and among populations 
      experiencing cooler rural versus warmer urban environmental temperatures (no evolved 
      differences in body size between urban and rural populations). Further, this 
      insensitivity of body size to temperature was highly consistent across each of the 
      three cities we examined. Because body size was robust to temperature variation, 
      previously described plastic and evolved shifts in heat (and cold) tolerance in 
      acorn ant responses to urbanization were shown to be independent of shifts in body 
      size. Indeed, genetic (colony-level) correlations between heat and cold tolerance 
      traits and body size revealed no significant association between size and tolerance. 
      Our results show how typical trait correlations, such as between size and thermal 
      tolerance, might be decoupled as populations respond to contemporary environmental 
      change.

AB  - Phthalates esters (PAEs) are ubiquitous contaminants in terrestrial system and PAEs 
      can be degraded to monoester metabolites (mPAEs) both in soil and plants, which have 
      equal or even greater biological activity compared to their parent compounds. Until 
      now, little is known about the comparative uptake and translocation of PAEs and 
      mPAEs in plants. In the present study, the uptake and translocation of two commonly 
      used plasticizers, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
      (DEHP), and the corresponding mPAEs, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and 
      mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) by Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. 
      chinensis) were examined using hydroponic experiment. Significantly lower 
      bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of mPAEs compared to the corresponding PAEs were 
      observed. This is likely due to the great solubility and electrical repulsion from 
      cell membrane to mPAE anions. Comparatively low translocation factors (TFs) of MnBP 
      (7.76 ± 0.49) were observed compared to DnBP (10.33 ± 2.83); while the TFs of MEHP 
      (0.18 ± 0.08) were significantly greater than that of DEHP (0.05 ± 0.02). The 
      hydrophilic mPAEs are prone to concentrate in cell water-soluble components, and 
      DnBP was relatively uniformly distributed in cell wall and cell water-soluble 
      components; while the more hydrophobic DEHP was mainly associated with root cell 
      wall. The formation of mPAEs occurred mainly in the above-ground tissues in the PAEs 
      spiked treatment, and cell water-soluble compartment was the main location for PAEs 
      metabolism. The high metabolite/parent ratios in Chinese cabbage indicate that more 
      concern should be directed towards metabolites associated with plants via direct 
      uptake and plant metabolism.

      Metaphire guillelmi were exposed to soil amended with 0.25% (w/w) high-density 
      polyethylene (HDPE, 25 μm) or polypropylene (PP, 13 μm) microplastics for 28 d. The 
      ingestion of HDPE and PP microplastics by M. guillelmi was clearly demonstrated by 
      Nile Red fluorescence staining method. There were significant differences for the 
      microbiota between the M. guillelmi gut and the surrounding soil, which may result 
      from the influence of specific conditions in the gut habitat. HDPE and PP 
      microplastics exposure did not induce gut microbiota dysbiosis in M. guillelmi. 
      However, PP microplastics exposure significantly reduced bacterial diversity and 
      altered bacterial community structure in the soil. Specifically, the relative 
      abundance of Aeromonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae significantly increased while the 
      relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and two unidentified families affiliated 
      with Proteobacteria significantly decreased. This study broadens our understanding 
      of the ecotoxicity of microplastics on the soil and gut microbiota of terrestrial 
      organisms.

AB  - Pollution in aquatic ecosystems is rapidly becoming one of the world's greatest 
      ecological challenges. Given their intermediate position between terrestrial and 
      marine environments, estuarine systems are especially vulnerable to human pollution. 
      Amazonian estuaries have unique characteristics, such as heterogeneous landscape 
      intercalating tracts of vegetation with sandbanks and beaches. In the present study, 
      we provide the first qualitative and quantitative data on litter retention in an 
      Amazonian estuary, comparing vegetated and bare substrate areas. Overall, 12,003 
      items were recovered, with a mean ± SD density and weight of 1.69 ± 2.16 items/m(2) 
      and 78.08 ± 93.11 g/m(2), respectively. Plastic was the principal material (80.97%) 
      found. The highest number of items was found in the vegetated habitats (73.11%), 
      indicating these areas as the most affected by plastic pollution. Our findings 
      provide important insights for future research planning and implementation of 
      effective public policies for conservation and management of these important 
      ecosystems.

PG  - 461-7
AB  - The contributions of Peter Hochachka to the development of comparative and 
      adaptational biochemistry are substantial. In particular, he and his academic 
      offspring made major contributions to the understanding of the metabolism of 
      molluscs and fishes. These two large taxonomic groups each have marine, freshwater 
      and terrestrial/semiterrestrial representatives, and their mitochondrial metabolism 
      has been shaped by these environmental conditions. In particular, the importance of 
      amino acids and lipids as energy sources has interesting correlations with the 
      environment and the osmotic strategy used. In marine molluscs, amino acids are 
      important aerobic energy sources, and are used as osmolytes and participate in 
      anaerobic metabolism. In marine elasmobranchs, amino acids and ketone bodies, but 
      not lipids per se, are important energy sources in extrahepatic tissues. Marine and 
      freshwater teleost fish by contrast use lipids as an extrahepatic energy source with 
      minimal use of ketone bodies. Furthermore, ketone bodies are important in the 
      metabolism of freshwater and terrestrial but not marine molluscs. The bases for 
      these different metabolic plans may lie in the solute systems used by the different 
      groups (e.g. amino acids in marine molluscs and urea in marine elasmobranchs). The 
      various metabolic options used by fishes and molluscs indicate the plasticity of 
      metabolic design in an environmental context.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPTs) are defined as colloids that originated from the unintentional 
      degradation of plastic debris. To understand the possible risks caused by NPTs, it 
      is crucial to determine how they are transported and where they may finally 
      accumulate. Unfortunately, although most sources of plastic are land-based, risk 
      assessments concerning NPTs in the terrestrial environmental system (soils, 
      aquifers, freshwater sediments, etc.) have been largely lacking compared to studies 
      concerning NPTs in the marine system. Furthermore, an important limitation of 
      environmental fate studies is that the NPT models used are questionable in terms of 
      their environmental representativeness. This study describes the fate of different 
      NPT models in a porous media under unfavorable (repulsive) conditions, according to 
      their physical and chemical properties: average hydrodynamic diameters (200-460 nm), 
      composition (polystyrene with additives or primary polystyrene) and shape (spherical 
      or polymorphic). NPTs that more closely mimic environmental NPTs present an 
      inhomogeneous shape (i.e., deviating from a sphere) and are more deposited in a sand 
      column by an order of magnitude. This deposition was attributed in part to physical 
      retention, as confirmed by the straining that occurred for the larger size 
      fractions. Additionally, different Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) models 
      -the extended DLVO (XDLVO) and a DLVO modified by surface element integration (SEI) 
      method-suggest that the environmentally relevant NPT models may alter its 
      orientation to diminish repulsion from the sand surface and may find enough kinetic 
      energy to deposit in the primary energetic minimum. These results point to the 
      importance of choosing environmentally relevant NPT models.

TI  - Fungal degradation of polyhydroxyalkanoates and a semiquantitative assay for 
      screening their degradation by terrestrial fungi.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - The current problems with decreasing fossile resources and increasing environmental 
      pollution by petrochemical-based plastics have stimulated investigations to find 
      biosynthetic materials which are also biodegradable. Bacterial reserve materials 
      such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) have been discovered to possess thermoplastic 
      properties and can be synthesized from renewable resources. Poly-beta-hydroxybutyric 
      acid (PHB) is at present the most promising PHA; and BIOPOL, its copolymer with 
      poly-beta-hydroxy-valerate (PHV), is already industrially produced (ICI, UK), and 
      used as packaging material (WELLA, FRG). According to the literature, PHA 
      degradation has so far mainly been observed in bacteria; only under certain 
      environmental conditions has fungal degradation of PHAs been indicated. Since fungi 
      constitute an important part of microbial populations participating in degradation 
      processes, a simple screening method for fungal degradation of BIOPOL, a PHA-based 
      plastic, was developed. Several media with about 150 fungal strains from different 
      terrestrial environments and belonging to different systematic and ecological groups 
      were used. PHA depolymerization was tested on three PHB-based media, each with 0.1% 
      BIOPOL or PHB homopolymer causing turbidity of the medium. The media contained 
      either a comparatively low or high content of organic carbon (beside PHA) or were 
      based on mineral medium with PHA as the principal source of carbon. The degradation 
      activity was detectable due to formation of a clear halo around the colony (Petri 
      plates) or a clear zone under the colony (test tubes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Up and away: ontogenic transference as a pathway for aerial dispersal of 
      microplastics.
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2018.0479 [doi]
LID - 20180479
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants found in marine, freshwater and 
      terrestrial ecosystems. With so many MPs in aquatic systems, it is inevitable that 
      they will be ingested by aquatic organisms and be transferred up through the food 
      chain. However, to date, no study has considered whether MPs can be transmitted by 
      means of ontogenic transference, i.e. between life stages that use different 
      habitats. Here, we determine whether fluorescent polystyrene beads could transfer 
      between Culex mosquito life stages and, particularly, could move into the flying 
      adult stage. We show for the first time that MPs can be transferred ontogenically 
      from a feeding (larva) into a non-feeding (pupa) life stage and subsequently into 
      the adult terrestrial life stage. However, transference is dependent on particle 
      size, with smaller 2 µm MPs transferring readily into pupae and adult stages, while 
      15 µm MPs transferred at a significantly reduced rate. MPs appear to accumulate in 
      the Malpighian tubule renal excretion system. The transfer of MPs to the adults 
      represents a potential aerial pathway to contamination of new environments. Thus, 
      any organism that feeds on terrestrial life phases of freshwater insects could be 
      impacted by MPs found in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Sea turtles are presently considered severely endangered species that are 
      historically threatened by many environmental factors. Recently, additional threats 
      to sea turtles from two pathogenic species of fungi in the Fusarium solani species 
      complex (F. falciforme and F. keratoplasticum) have been identified. These species 
      infect marine turtle eggs, causing sea turtle egg fusariosis, and kill their 
      embryos, with recent reports of hatch-failure in seven globally distributed species 
      of endangered sea turtles (Caretta caretta, Chelonia mydas, Dermochelys coriaceae, 
      Eretmochelys imbricata, Lepidochelys olivacea, Lepidochelys kempi and Natator 
      depressus). Mycelia and spores of pathogenic species of Fusarium are produced in 
      disturbed terrestrial soils and are transported to the ocean in coastal run off. We 
      propose that these fungi grow on floating particles of plant tissues (leaves and 
      wood), animal tissues, silt and plastics, which are carried by wind and currents and 
      the turtles themselves to the beaches where the turtles lay their eggs.

AB  - Potential adverse effects of nanoplastics (NPs) on marine organisms have received 
      increased attention in recent years. In contrast, few data are available on 
      terrestrial plants, especially on the mechanisms for transport of NPs in plants and 
      phytotoxicity (at both phenotypic and molecular levels) of plants induced by NPs. To 
      address this knowledge gap, we conducted a microcosm study in which 
      hydroponically-cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were exposed to polystyrene 
      (PS)-NPs at 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg L(-1) for 16 d and examined for morphological and 
      physiological phenotypes and transcriptomics. Laser confocal scanning micrographs 
      confirmed PS-NPs were uptaken by rice roots, greatly benefitted from the transport 
      activity of aquaporin in rice roots. The significant enhancement (p < 0.05) of 
      antioxidant enzyme activities reflected the oxidative stress response of rice roots 
      upon exposure to PS-NPs. Treatment by PS-NPs decreased root length and increased 
      lateral root numbers. Carbon metabolism was activated (e.g., increased carbon and 
      soluble sugar contents) whereas jasmonic acid and lignin biosynthesis were 
      inhibited. The present study demonstrated the likelihood for transport of PS-NPs in 
      rice roots and induced phytotoxicity by PS-NPs, which should inspire further 
      investigations into the potential human health risks from rice consumption.

TI  - Effects of DEHP on the ecdysteroid pathway, sexual behavior and offspring of the 
      moth Spodoptera littoralis.

AB  - Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a widely produced plasticizer that is 
      considered to act as an endocrine-disrupting chemical in vertebrates and 
      invertebrates. Indeed, many studies have shown that DEHP alters hormonal levels, 
      reproduction and behavior in vertebrates. Few studies have focused on the effects of 
      DEHP on insects, although DEHP is found almost everywhere in their natural habitats, 
      particularly in soils and plants. Here, we investigated the effects of DEHP on the 
      sexual behavior and physiology of a pest insect, the noctuid moth Spodoptera 
      littoralis. In this nocturnal species, olfaction is crucial for sexual behavior, and 
      ecdysteroids at the antennal level have been shown to modulate sex pheromone 
      detection by males. In the present study, larvae were fed food containing different 
      DEHP concentrations, and DEHP concentrations were then measured in the adults (males 
      and females). Hemolymphatic ecdysteroid concentrations, the antennal expression of 
      genes involved in the ecdysteroid pathway (nuclear receptors EcR, USP, E75, and E78 
      and calmodulin) and sexual behavior were then investigated in adult males. The 
      success and latency of mating as well as the hatching success were also studied in 
      pairs consisting of one DEHP male and one uncontaminated female or one DEHP female 
      and one uncontaminated male. We also studied the offspring produced from pairs 
      involving contaminated females to test the transgenerational effect of DEHP. Our 
      results showed the general downregulation of nuclear receptors and calmodulin gene 
      expression associated with the higher concentrations of DEHP, suggesting peripheral 
      olfactory disruption. We found some effects on male behavior but without an 
      alteration of the mating rate. Effects on offspring mortality and developmental 
      rates in the N + 1 generation were also found at the higher doses of DEHP. Taken 
      together, the results of the study show for the first time that larval exposure to 
      DEHP can induce delayed endocrine-disruptive effects in the adults of a terrestrial 
      insect as well as effects on the next generation. To date, our study is also the 
      first description of an impact of endocrine disrupter on olfaction in insects.

AB  - Microplastics are emerging pollutants which have been extensively detected in water 
      environments. However, little is known about microplastic pollution in soil 
      environments. In this study, we investigated microplastics and mesoplastics in 
      farmland soils from twenty vegetable fields around the suburbs of Shanghai. In each 
      site, three duplicate soil samples were collected from shallow (0-3 cm) and deep 
      soils (3-6 cm), respectively. Microplastics (sizes of 20 μm - 5 mm) and mesoplastics 
      (5 mm - 2 cm) were detected using methods of density extraction, 30% H(2)O(2) 
      digestion and micro-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The abundance of 
      microplastics was 78.00 ± 12.91 and 62.50 ± 12.97 items kg(-1) in shallow and deep 
      soils, respectively. While, mesoplastics were found with abundance of 6.75 ± 1.51 
      and 3.25 ± 1.04 items kg(-1) in shallow and deep soils. Among these 
      micro(meso)plastics, 48.79% and 59.81% were in size of <1 mm in shallow and deep 
      soils. The main morphotypes of microplastics included fiber, fragment and film, 
      mostly in color of black or transparent. Moreover, we found that topsoil contained 
      higher concentrations and larger sizes of micro(meso)plastics than deep soil. In 
      addition, the vast majority of micro(meso)plastics were polypropylene (50.51%) and 
      polyethylene (43.43%). This study reveals occurrence and characteristics of 
      microplastic pollution in typical farmland soils. It provides important data for 
      subsequent research on microplatics in the terrestrial ecosystem.

AB  - Drift of floating debris is studied with a 2D Lagrangian model with stochastic 
      beaching and sedimentation of plastics. An ensemble of >10(10) virtual particles is 
      tracked from anthropogenic sources (coastal human populations, rivers, shipping 
      lanes) to environmental destinations (sea surface, coastlines, seabed). Daily 
      analyses of ocean currents and waves provided by CMEMS at a horizontal resolution of 
      1/16° are used to force the plastics. High spatio-temporal variability in 
      sea-surface plastic concentrations without any stable long-term accumulations is 
      found. Substantial accumulation of plastics is detected on coastlines and the sea 
      bottom. The most contaminated areas are in the Cilician subbasin, Catalan Sea, and 
      near the Po River Delta. Also, highly polluted local patches in the vicinity of 
      sources with limited circulation are identified. An inverse problem solution, used 
      to quantify the origins of plastics, shows that plastic pollution of every 
      Mediterranean country is caused primarily by its own terrestrial sources.

AB  - Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the main plastic polymers contaminating 
      natural ecosystems. Although PET microplastics (PET-MPs) have been found in both 
      aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, the information concerning their potential 
      toxicity towards terrestrial organisms is limited. The present study aimed at 
      investigating the ingestion and the possible adverse effects induced by a 40-days 
      exposure to irregular shaped PET-MPs toward the giant snail Achatina reticulata. 
      Giant snails were exposed via the diet to two concentrations (1% and 10% w/w; i.e., 
      g of PET-MPs/g of the administered food) of PET-MPs and their capability to ingest 
      and egest PET-MPs was assessed together with an evaluation of their potential 
      effects at biochemical and individual levels. Oxidative stress-related biomarkers 
      (i.e., the amount of reactive oxygen species, the activity of antioxidant enzymes 
      and lipid peroxidation) and DNA fragmentation were measured in the digestive gland 
      isolated from snails as biochemical endpoints. Changes in growth trajectories, in 
      terms of body weight and shell size, were considered as morphometric endpoints. Our 
      results demonstrated that A. reticulata can efficiently ingest and egest PET-MPs. 
      Whilst giant snails did not experience an oxidative stress condition, significant 
      changes in their growth trajectories were observed, with PET-MPs-treated snails grew 
      more and more quickly than the control group. Our results suggest that PET-MPs might 
      represent a risk during early-life stages for terrestrial organisms.

TI  - Adaptation of the spiders to the environment: the case of some Chilean species.
PG  - 220

LID - 220
AB  - Spiders are small arthropods that have colonized terrestrial environments. These 
      impose three main problems: (i) terrestrial habitats have large fluctuations in 
      temperature and humidity; (ii) the internal concentration of water is higher than 
      the external environment in spiders, which exposes them continually to water loss; 
      and (iii) their small body size determines a large surface/volume ratio, affecting 
      energy exchange and influencing the life strategy. In this review we focus on body 
      design, energetic, thermal selection, and water balance characteristics of some 
      spider species present in Chile and correlate our results with ecological and 
      behavioral information. Preferred temperatures and critical temperatures of Chilean 
      spiders vary among species and individuals and may be adjusted by phenotypic 
      plasticity. For example in the mygalomorph high-altitude spider Paraphysa parvula 
      the preferred temperature is similar to that of the lowland spider Grammostola 
      rosea; but while P. parvula shows phenotypic plasticity, G. rosea does not. The 
      araneomorph spiders Loxosceles laeta and Scytodes globula have greater daily 
      variations in preferred temperatures at twilight and during the night, which are set 
      to the nocturnal activity rhythms of these species. They also present acclimation of 
      the minimum critical temperatures. Dysdera crocata has a low preferred temperature 
      adjusted to its favorite prey, the woodlouse. Spider metabolic rate is low compared 
      to other arthropods, which may be associated with its sit and wait predatory 
      strategy particularly in primitive hunter and weavers. In mygalomorph spiders the 
      respiratory system is highly optimized with high oxygen conductance, for example G. 
      rosea needs only a difference of 0.12-0.16 kPa in the oxygen partial pressure across 
      the air-hemolymph barrier to satisfy its resting oxygen consumption demands. Water 
      loss is a significant stress for spiders. Paraphysa parvula shows an evaporative 
      water loss 10 times more than usual when the temperature approaches 40°C and the 
      participation of book lungs in this loss is about 60%. This species and others show 
      seasonal changes in water loss accounted for by changes in cuticle permeability. The 
      case of Chilean spiders shows how the ecophysiology in spiders is associated to 
      their design and body size and how is affected by fluctuating Mediterranean 
      environments, suggesting that the adaptive process can be seen as a route of 
      optimizing the use of energy to cope with environmental restrictions imposed by the 
      interaction with the terrestrial environment and lifestyle.

AB  - Plastics enter in terrestrial natural system primarily by agricultural purposes, 
      while acid rain is the result of anthropogenic activities. The synergistic effects 
      of microplastics and acid rain on plant growth are not known. In this study, 
      different sizes of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and acid rain are tested on 
      Lepidium sativum, in two separate experimental sets. In the first one we treated 
      plants only with PET, in the second one we used PET and acid rain together. In both 
      experimentations we analyzed: i) plant biometrical parameters (shoot height, leaf 
      number, percentage inhibition of seed germination, fresh biomass), and ii) oxidative 
      stress responses (hydrogen peroxide; ascorbic acid and glutathione). Results carried 
      out from our experiments highlighted that different sizes of polyethylene 
      terephthalate are able to affect plant growth and physiological responses, with or 
      without acid rain supplied during acute toxicity (6 days). SHORT DESCRIPTION: This 
      study showed that different sizes of PET microplastics affect physiological and 
      biometrical responses of Lepidum sativum seedlings, with or without acid rain; roots 
      and leaves responded differently.

AB  - Between April to November of 2017, microplastics (MPs) were analysed in biosolids 
      from two separate suppliers, and in the soils of three agricultural fields to which 
      they were applied, in Ontario, Canada. Soils of a control site with no history of 
      biosolid application were also examined. High MP concentrations of between 
      8.7 × 10(3) MP kg(-1) and 1.4 × 10(4) MP kg(-1) were found in biosolids samples. 
      Lower MP concentrations observed in Provider 2 biosolids may be due to storage, 
      settling and supernatant removal prior to applications. Annual MP additions to 
      agricultural soils across Ontario were estimated at between 4.1 × 10(11) and 
      1.3 × 10(12) particles. All fields receiving biosolids had higher soil pre-treatment 
      MP concentrations than the control. The field with the greatest number of previous 
      biosolid treatments had the highest pre-treatment soil MP concentrations; suggesting 
      some MP retention in soils between applications. Immediately following biosolids 
      applications, two fields demonstrated significant increases in soil MP 
      concentrations, with preferential retention of MP fibers over fragments observed, 
      while a reduction in soil MP concentrations were observed in the third. 
      Surprisingly, only one field demonstrated a net gain in soil MPs over the course of 
      the study. At all three fields, >99% of MPs applied in biosolids in 2017 were 
      unaccounted for. The study suggests that despite adhering to applicable legislation, 
      biosolids applications at all sites likely result in high rates of MP export. This 
      study is the first to track MP transport through soils following their application 
      in biosolids, and contributes to filling current knowledge gaps regarding export of 
      MPs to aquatic systems from the terrestrial environment.

AB  - Di-butyl phthalate (DBP) is an extensively applied synthetic plasticizer, toxic 
      organic compound with elevated concentrations in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem 
      that cause serious risk to the human health. A marine bacterium Rhodovulum sp. DBP07 
      isolated from sea water with proficient of efficiently degrading DBP. The maximum 
      DBP degradation (70.2%) and the cell growth (1.3 OD(600nm)) were observed at 
      600 mg/L. The DBP degradation characteristics of the isolate Rhodovulum sp. DBP07 
      with diverse preliminary concentrations of DBP was found to be 200 ˃ 400 ˃ 600 ˂ 800 
      ˂ 1000 mg/L DBP. Glucose was identified as most favorable nutrient factor for the 
      enhanced growth and showed 79.8 and 77.4% of degradation rate at 5.0 and 2.0 g/L 
      respectively. The influence of the carbon sources on DBP degradation was found to be 
      Glucose ˃ fructose ˃ sucrose ˃ maltose ˃ lactose ˃ citric acid ˃ starch. Box-Behnken 
      (BBD) statistical optimization results showed enhanced DBP biodegradation rate 
      (91.1%) at pH 7.0, 3% of NaCl concentration with 3 days of incubation. Two 
      intermediate compounds were observed in the retention times of 10.8 and 12.2 which 
      are identified as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and mono-nbutyl phthalate (MBP) using Gas 
      chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Furthermore, the phthalate (pht) gene 
      expression pattern under DBP stress was analyzed using RT-qPCR and the maximum fold 
      change (5.7 fold) was observed at 3 day of incubation. Overall, the observed results 
      indicate the possibility of utilizing Rhodovulum sp. for remediation of DBP 
      contaminated environment.

AB  - The origin of tetrapods from their fish antecedents, approximately 400 million years 
      ago, was coupled with the origin of terrestrial locomotion and the evolution of 
      supporting limbs. Polypterus is a member of the basal-most group of ray-finned fish 
      (actinopterygians) and has many plesiomorphic morphologies that are comparable to 
      elpistostegid fishes, which are stem tetrapods. Polypterus therefore serves as an 
      extant analogue of stem tetrapods, allowing us to examine how developmental 
      plasticity affects the 'terrestrialization' of fish. We measured the developmental 
      plasticity of anatomical and biomechanical responses in Polypterus reared on land. 
      Here we show the remarkable correspondence between the environmentally induced 
      phenotypes of terrestrialized Polypterus and the ancient anatomical changes in stem 
      tetrapods, and we provide insight into stem tetrapod behavioural evolution. Our 
      results raise the possibility that environmentally induced developmental plasticity 
      facilitated the origin of the terrestrial traits that led to tetrapods.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging concern and potential risk to marine and 
      terrestrial environments. Surface soils are reported to act as a sink. However, MP 
      vertical mobility in the subsurface remains uncertain due to a lack of scientific 
      data. This study focused on MP penetration in sand soil column experiments. Here we 
      report the mobility of five different MPs, which consisted of polyethylene (PE) and 
      polypropylene (PP) particles of various sizes and densities. We observed that the 
      smallest sized PE MPs (21 μm) had the greatest movement potential. Moreover, it was 
      found that when these MPs were subjected to greater numbers of wet-dry cycles, the 
      penetration depth significantly increased, with an apparent linear relationship 
      between depth and wet-dry cycle number (r(2) = 0.817). In comparison, increasing the 
      volume of infiltration liquid or the surface MP concentration had only negligible or 
      weak effects on migration depth (r(2) = 0.169 and 0.312, respectively). Based on the 
      observed wet-dry cycle trend, we forecast 100-year penetration depths using weather 
      data for 347 cities across China. The average penetration depth was calculated as 
      5.24 m (95% CI = 2.78-7.70 m), with Beijing Municipality and Hebei, Henan and Hubei 
      provinces being the most vulnerable to MP vertical dispersion. Our results suggest 
      that soils may not only represent a sink for MPs, but also a feasible entryway to 
      subsurface receptors, such as subterranean fauna or aquifers. Finally, research gaps 
      are identified and suggested research directions are put forward to garner a better 
      understanding MP vertical migration in soil.

AB  - Sewage sludge is a primary pathway for microplastics (MPs) entering into terrestrial 
      ecosystems. However, a standardized method to analyze MP in sludge is lacking due to 
      its high organic matter. This study investigated the extraction efficiency of six 
      MPs in five solid matrices, i.e. sewage sludge, cattle manure, soil, sediment and 
      silicon dioxide. Results show lower extraction efficiency of 87.2% for MPs in sludge 
      compared with that in other matrices, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
      (only 27.8%). The possible reason was that the presence of extracellular polymeric 
      substances within the sludge hinders the MPs to float. Therefore, five protocols, 
      i.e. hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), Fenton, nitric acid (HNO(3)), hydrochloric acid 
      (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were used to pretreat the sludge and optimize the 
      MP extraction. The sludge pretreated by H(2)O(2), Fenton and 1 M of acids had higher 
      MP extraction efficiency than the raw sludge due to higher extraction of the PET. 
      The MP extraction efficiency in the sludge first increased, and subsequently 
      decreased with the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) content, implying that 
      moderate dissolution of sludge organic matter is beneficial to the MP extraction. 
      Quantitative analysis of the changes in the MP physicochemical characteristics after 
      the pretreatments indicated that polyamide (PA) and PET are not resistant to acid 
      and alkali treatment, respectively. Principal component analysis shows that the 
      effect of pretreatments on the MPs follows a decreasing sequence: alkali > high 
      concentration of acids > low concentration of acids > H(2)O(2) and Fenton. 
      Additionally, the susceptibility of the MPs to the pretreatments follows a 
      decreasing sequence: PET, PA and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) > polystyrene 
      (PS) > polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). The findings supply novel insights 
      into the effect of chemical pretreatments on MP extraction in sewage sludge.

AB  - With the wide use of mulch film and pesticides, mulch film-derived microplastics are 
      very likely to produce combined effects with pesticides in agricultural soil. 
      However, little is known about their combined toxicity on terrestrial organisms. 
      This study aimed to investigate the combined toxicity of unused or farmland residual 
      transparent low-density polyethylene mulch film-derived microplastics (MPs and 
      MPs-aged, respectively) (550-1000 μm) and atrazine (ATZ; 0.02 and 2.0 mg/kg) on the 
      earthworm (Eisenia fetida). After single and combined exposure to ATZ and 
      microplastics for 28 d, the results showed an accumulation of reactive oxygen 
      species, a decrease in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione-S-transferase 
      activities, an increase in the malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels, 
      and abnormal expression of annetocin, heat shock protein 70, translationally 
      controlled tumor protein and calreticulin genes. Integrated biological response 
      (IBR) values calculated at the biochemical level indicated that the combined 
      exposure to ATZ and microplastics, particularly to high concentrations of ATZ, 
      induced greater oxidative stress in E. fetida compared with that of exposure to ATZ 
      or microplastics alone. In addition, the IBR values calculated at the gene level did 
      not show regular changes after combined exposure to ATZ and microplastics compared 
      with those of a single exposure. The oxidative stress and abnormal expression of 
      genes in E. fetida induced by MPs-aged were higher than those induced by MPs; a 
      similar trend was observed for oxidative stress induced by MPs/MPs-aged + ATZ2.0, 
      whereas an opposite trend was observed for the abnormal expression of genes in E. 
      fetida induced by MPs/MPs-aged + ATZ0.02/ATZ2.0. Our results suggest that mulch 
      film-derived microplastics have the potential to enhance the toxicity of ATZ within 
      the soil environment.

AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the abundance of plastic pollution in the 
      gastrointestinal tracts in birds of prey. Data was collected from all birds 
      retrieved from the Audubon Center for Birds of Prey in central Florida, USA from 
      January to May 2018. Individuals were either dead prior to reaching the Center or 
      died within 24 h of arrival with no food consumed during captivity. Sixty-three 
      individuals representing eight species were dissected to extract the 
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus to the large intestine. Microplastics 
      were found in the GI tracts in all examined species and in all individual birds. The 
      overall mean number (±S.E.) of microplastics for species of bird of prey in central 
      Florida was 11.9 (±2.8), and the overall mean number of microplastics per gram of GI 
      tract tissue was 0.3 (±0.1). A total of 1197 pieces of plastic were recorded. 
      Microfibers accounted for 86% of total plastics followed by microfragments (13%), 
      macroplastics (0.7%) and microbeads (0.3%). Most fibers were either clear or royal 
      blue in color. Micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μ-FTIR) found that 
      processed cellulose was the most common polymer identified in birds (37%), followed 
      by polyethylene terephthalate (16%) and a polymer blend (4:1) of polyamide-6 and 
      poly(ethylene-co-polypropylene) (11%). Two bird species, Buteo lineatus 
      (red-shouldered hawk, n = 28) and Pandion haliaetus (osprey, n = 16), were 
      sufficiently abundant to enable statistical analyses. Microplastics were 
      significantly more abundant per gram in the gastrointestinal tract tissue of 
      B. lineatus, that consumes small mammals, snakes, and amphibians, than in 
      fish-feeding P. haliaetus (ANOVA: p = 0.013). If raptors in terrestrial food webs 
      have higher densities of microplastics than aquatic top predators, then it 
      potentially could be due to a combination of direct intake of plastics and indirect 
      consumption via trophic transfer.

AB  - Investigating wide range of food products of direct human consumption for 
      microplastics is critical to understand the routes of contamination and assess the 
      risks in microplastics uptake by humans. However, microplastics knowledge for many 
      beverage products excluding beers is still lacking. Here, common beverages (n = 57; 
      27 brands) such as soft drinks (n = 19), energy drinks (n = 8), cold tea (n = 4) and 
      beer (n = 26) were targeted for microplastics occurrences in Mexico and their shape, 
      size, surface morphology and polymer composition were analyzed. Microplastics were 
      detected in 48 out of 57 samples tested. The results identified microplastics of 
      various forms (fibers and fragments) and sizes (0.1-3 mm) of colors (blue, red, 
      brown, black and green), in amounts ranging from not detected to 28 ± 5.29 
      particles/L. Micro-Raman spectroscopy identified particles as polyamide, 
      poly(ester-amide), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and poly(ethylene-terephthalate) 
      indicating microplastics contamination of synthetic textiles and packaging origin in 
      the beverage products. Finally, this paper discusses that human excreta could act as 
      a vehicle for the dispersion and accumulation of microplastics into terrestrial and 
      aquatic environments. Combined, it is the first study to investigate microplastics 
      contamination on soft drinks, energy drinks and cold tea and to document the 
      material composition of microplastics from beverage products.

      functional display of a carboxylesterase on the surface of Escherichia coli.
PG  - 114

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are widely used as plasticizers or additives 
      during the industrial manufacturing of plastic products. PAEs have been detected in 
      both aquatic and terrestrial environments due to their overuse. Exposure of PAEs 
      results in human health concerns and environmental pollution. Diisobutyl phthalate 
      is one of the main plasticizers in PAEs. Cell surface display of recombinant 
      proteins has become a powerful tool for biotechnology applications. In this current 
      study, a carboxylesterase was displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli cells, 
      for use as whole-cell biocatalyst in diisobutyl phthalate biodegradation. RESULTS: A 
      carboxylesterase-encoding gene (carEW) identified from Bacillus sp. K91, was fused 
      to the N-terminal of ice nucleation protein (inpn) anchor from Pseudomonas syringae 
      and gfp gene, and the fused protein was then cloned into pET-28a(+) vector and was 
      expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The surface localization of 
      INPN-CarEW/or INPN-CarEW-GFP fusion protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, western blot, 
      proteinase accessibility assay, and green fluorescence measurement. The catalytic 
      activity of the constructed E. coli surface-displayed cells was determined. The 
      cell-surface-displayed CarEW displayed optimal temperature of 45 °C and optimal pH 
      of 9.0, using p-NPC(2) as substrate. In addition, the whole cell biocatalyst 
      retained ~ 100% and ~ 200% of its original activity per OD(600) over a period of 
      23 days at 45 °C and one month at 4 °C, exhibiting the better stability than free 
      CarEW. Furthermore, approximately 1.5 mg/ml of DiBP was degraded by 10 U of 
      surface-displayed CarEW cells in 120 min. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a 
      promising strategy of cost-efficient biodegradation of diisobutyl phthalate for 
      environmental bioremediation by displaying CarEW on the surface of E. coli cells. 
      This approach might also provide a reference in treatment of other different kinds 
      of environmental pollutants by displaying the enzyme of interest on the cell surface 
      of a harmless microorganism.

AB  - Microplastics and nanoplastics are emerging pollutants of global concern. However, 
      the understanding of their ecological effects on terrestrial plants is still 
      limited. We conducted the systematic research to reveal the impact of polystyrene 
      nanoplastics (PSNPs) (0.01-10 mg/L) on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat 
      (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that PSNPs had no discernible effect on 
      seed germination rate whereas significantly (p < 0.01) increased root elongation by 
      88.6 %-122.6 % when compared with the control. Similarly, remarkable increases in 
      carbon, nitrogen contents, and plant biomass were also observed after exposure to 
      PSNPs. Moreover, PSNPs could reduce the shoot to root biomass ratio (S:R ratio) of 
      wheat seedlings. Furthermore, the imagings of a 3D laser confocal scanning 
      microscopy (LCSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that PSNPs were 
      taken up and subsequently down-top transported to shoot. The absorption and 
      accumulation of four micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn) in wheat were generally 
      reduced in varying degrees. Notably, metabolomics analysis revealed that all PSNPs 
      treatments altered the leaf metabolic profiles mainly by regulating energy 
      metabolisms and amino acid metabolisms. These findings are expected to provide new 
      insights into the effects of PSNPs on crop plants.

AB  - Microplastic contamination in the ocean has emerged as an environmental issue of 
      global importance. The most effective strategy to control microplastic pollution is 
      to reduce the terrestrial input, but severe weather conditions make it difficult. 
      This study investigated microplastic abundance and characteristics in the seawater, 
      sediments, and cultured oysters (Crassostrea gigas) of Sanggou Bay (China) before 
      and after two typhoons with an average rainfall of 19.2 mm/d over 8 days. Prior to 
      the typhoons, microplastic levels in the seawater, sediment, and oysters were 
      63.6 ± 37.4 items/L, 2178 ± 369 items/kg, and 41.0 ± 15.5 items/individual, with 
      fibers being the predominant shape. Typhoons increased the average concentrations of 
      microplastics in the seawater and sediments by approximately 40%, and the 
      proportions of fragments, spherules, and granules in the sediments increased by 
      9.6%, 4.0%, and 4.3%, respectively. The majority of microplastics in seawater, 
      sediments, and oysters collected before the typhoons could be grouped into sizes of 
      0.1-0.5 mm (36.7%), 0.05-0.1 mm (42.6%), and 0.1-0.5 mm (47.1%), respectively. After 
      the typhoons, the most abundant size classes of microplastics in the three 
      environmental compartments were 0.05-0.1 mm (39.2%) for seawater, 0.1-0.5 mm (37.1%) 
      for sediments, and 0.05-0.1 mm (29.9%) for oysters. The typhoons also altered color 
      distribution of microplastics and increased the proportions of polypropylene, 
      polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate in seawater. Scanning electron 
      microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that organic matter and heavy 
      metals were present on the microplastics collected from oysters. Our results suggest 
      that weather conditions should be considered when investigating marine 
      microplastics.

TI  - Effects of climate change and UV-B on materials.
PG  - 68-72
AB  - The outdoor service life of common plastic materials is limited by their 
      susceptibility to solar ultraviolet radiation. Of the solar wavelengths the UV-B 
      component is particularly efficient in bringing about photodamage in synthetic and 
      naturally occurring materials. This is particularly true of plastics, rubber and 
      wood used in the building and agricultural industries. Any depletion in the 
      stratospheric ozone layer and resulting increase in the UV-B component of 
      terrestrial sunlight will therefore tend to decrease the service life of these 
      materials. The extent to which the service life is reduced is, however, difficult to 
      estimate as it depends on several factors. These include the chemical nature of the 
      material, the additives it contains, the type and the amount of light-stabilizers 
      (or protective coatings) used, and the amount of solar exposure it receives. 
      Concomitant climate change is likely to increase the ambient temperature and 
      humidity in some of the same regions likely to receive increased UV-B radiation. 
      These factors, particularly higher temperatures, are also well known to accelerate 
      the rate of photodegradation of materials, and may therefore further limit the 
      service life of materials in these regions. To reliably assess the damage to 
      materials as a consequence of ozone layer depletion, the wavelength sensitivity of 
      the degradation process, dose-response relationships for the material and the 
      effectiveness of available stabilizers need to be quantified. The data needed for 
      the purpose are not readily available at this time for most of the commonly used 
      plastics or wood materials. Wavelength sensitivity of a number of common plastic 
      materials and natural biopolymers are available and generally show the damage (per 
      photon) to decrease exponentially with the wavelength. Despite the relatively higher 
      fraction of UV-A in sunlight, the UV-B content is responsible for a significant part 
      of light-induced damage of materials. The primary approach to mitigation relies on 
      the effectiveness of the existing light stabilizers (such as hindered amine light 
      stabilizers, HALS) used in plastics exposed to harsh solar UV conditions coupled 
      with climate change factors. In developing advanced light-stabilizer technologies, 
      more light-resistant grades of common plastics, or surface protection technologies 
      for wood, the harsh weathering environment created by the simultaneous action of 
      increased UV-B levels due to ozone depletion as well as the relevant climate change 
      factors need to be taken into consideration. Recent literature includes several 
      studies on synergism of HALS-based stabilizers, stabilizer effectiveness in the new 
      m-polyolefins and elucidation of the mechanism of stabilization afforded by titania 
      pigment in vinyl plastics.

      classification of plastic type.
PG  - 17741-17756
LID - 10.1364/OE.393231 [doi]
AB  - The identification of plastic type is important for environmental applications 
      ranging from recycling to understanding the fate of plastics in marine, atmospheric, 
      and terrestrial environments. Infrared reflectance spectroscopy is a powerful 
      approach for plastics identification, requiring only optical access to a sample. The 
      use of visible and near-infrared wavelengths for plastics identification are 
      limiting as dark colored plastics absorb at these wavelengths, producing no 
      reflectance spectra. The use of mid-infrared wavelengths instead enables dark 
      plastics to be identified. Here we demonstrate the capability to utilize a pulsed, 
      widely-tunable (5.59 - 7.41 µm) mid-infrared quantum cascade laser, as the source 
      for reflectance spectroscopy, for the rapid and robust identification of plastics. 
      Through the application of linear discriminant analysis to the resulting spectral 
      data set, we demonstrate that we can correctly classify five plastic types: 
      polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density 
      polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS), with a 97% accuracy 
      rate.

AB  - Although concerns surrounding microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial ecosystems have 
      been growing in recent years, little is known about the responses of plant growth to 
      MPs pollution. Here, we conducted a pot experiment in a net house under natural 
      condition by adding two types of MPs, low-density polyethylene (LDPE-MPs) and 
      polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with poly-butylene-adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT, 
      Bio-MPs), to sandy soil at 5 doses (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5% ω/ω dry soil 
      weight). The effects of LDPE-MPs and Bio-MPs on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) 
      were tested. Compared to control (no MPs addition), LDPE-MPs showed no significant 
      effects on shoot, root and fruit biomass while ≥1.0% LDPE-MPs showed significant 
      higher specific root nodules (n·g(-1) dry root biomass) and only 2.5% LDPE-MPs 
      showed significant higher specific root length (cm·g(-1) dry root biomass). 1.0% 
      LDPE-MPs caused significant higher leaf area and 0.5% LDPE-MPs caused significant 
      lower leaf relative chlorophyll content. For Bio-MPs treatment, compared to control, 
      ≥1.5% Bio-MPs showed significant lower shoot and root biomass. ≥2.0% Bio-MPs showed 
      significant lower leaf area and fruit biomass. All Bio-MPs treatments showed 
      significant higher specific root length and specific root nodules as compared to 
      control. The results of the current research show that both MPs induced the 
      responses of common bean growth, and ≥1.5% Bio-MPs exerted stronger effects. Further 
      studies of their ecological impacts on soil-plant systems are urgently needed.

AB  - This review provides a critical analysis of the biological effects of the most 
      widely used plasticizers, including dibutyl phthalate, diethylhexyl phthalate, 
      dimethyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate and bisphenol A (BPA), on wildlife, with 
      a focus on annelids (both aquatic and terrestrial), molluscs, crustaceans, insects, 
      fish and amphibians. Moreover, the paper provides novel data on the biological 
      effects of some of these plasticizers in invertebrates, fish and amphibians. 
      Phthalates and BPA have been shown to affect reproduction in all studied animal 
      groups, to impair development in crustaceans and amphibians and to induce genetic 
      aberrations. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be especially sensitive 
      to these compounds, and biological effects are observed at environmentally relevant 
      exposures in the low ng l(-1) to microg l(-1) range. In contrast, most effects in 
      fish (except for disturbance in spermatogenesis) occur at higher concentrations. 
      Most plasticizers appear to act by interfering with the functioning of various 
      hormone systems, but some phthalates have wider pathways of disruption. Effect 
      concentrations of plasticizers in laboratory experiments coincide with measured 
      environmental concentrations, and thus there is a very real potential for effects of 
      these chemicals on some wildlife populations. The most striking gaps in our current 
      knowledge on the impacts of plasticizers on wildlife are the lack of data for 
      long-term exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations and their ecotoxicity 
      when part of complex mixtures. Furthermore, the hazard of plasticizers has been 
      investigated in annelids, molluscs and arthropods only, and given the sensitivity of 
      some invertebrates, effects assessments are warranted in other invertebrate phyla.

AB  - Marine organisms provide some of the most important examples of phenotypic 
      plasticity to date. We conducted a systematic review to cast a wide net through the 
      literature to examine general patterns among marine taxa and to identify gaps in our 
      knowledge. Unlike terrestrial systems, most studies of plasticity are on animals and 
      fewer on plants and algae. For invertebrates, twice as many studies are on mobile 
      than sessile species and for both animals and plants most species are benthic 
      intertidal zone taxa. For invertebrates, morphological plasticity is most common, 
      while chemical plasticity is most common among algae. For algae, as expected, 
      predators (inducible defences) are the primary cue for triggering plasticity. 
      Surprisingly, for invertebrates the abiotic environment is the most common trigger 
      for plasticity. Inducible defences in invertebrates have received great attention 
      and predominate for a few well-studied species, which can bias perceptions; but, 
      their predominance overall is not supported by the full data set. We also identified 
      important research needs, including the need for data on non-temperate zone taxa, 
      planned experiments to directly test the role of habitat variability and the 
      prevalence of plasticity. We also need information on the lag time for induction of 
      plastic traits, which is critical for determining the adaptive value of phenotypic 
      plasticity. Studies of early life stages and studies that link plasticity to 
      mechanisms that produce phenotypes are critically needed, as are phylogenetic 
      comparative studies that can be used to examine responses of organisms to both 
      short- and long-term change.

AB  - Microplastic contamination is not only a pressing environmental concern in oceans, 
      but also terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about its potential 
      impacts on pollinators. Here, we reported the effects of 25 μm-diameter spherical 
      polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) alone or in combination with the antibiotic 
      tetracycline on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in the laboratory. We noticed that 
      PS-MPs exposure for 14 d had sublethal effects, with low mortalities (up to 1.6 %) 
      across three different treatments (0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L) and no changes to the body 
      weight gains compared to the control bees. Nevertheless, PS-MPs exposure led to 
      significant decreases in the α-diversity of bees' gut microbiota accompanied by 
      changes to the core microbial population structure. Additionally, PS-MPs lead to 
      alterations in the expression of antioxidative (Cat), detoxification (CypQ1 and 
      GstS3), and immune system-related genes (Domeless, Hopscotch, and Symplekin) in 
      guts. More interestingly, we observed that PS-MPs accumulated and degraded inside of 
      the hindgut and interacted with gut bacteria. The depletion of the normal gut 
      microbiota using tetracycline dramatically increased the lethality of microplastics. 
      These results provide a resource for future research on microplastic-microbiome 
      interactions in other insects and also shed light on understanding the potential 
      effects of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging contaminant and are confirmed to be ubiquitous 
      in the environment. Adverse effects of MPs on aquatic organisms have been widely 
      studied, whereas little research has focused on soil invertebrates. We exposed the 
      soil springtail Folsomia candida to artificial soils contaminated with polyethylene 
      MPs (<500 μm) for 28 d to explore the effects of MPs on avoidance, reproduction, and 
      gut microbiota. Springtails exhibited avoidance behaviors at 0.5% and 1% MPs (w/w in 
      dry soil), and the avoidance rate was 59% and 69%, respectively. Reproduction was 
      inhibited when the concentration of MPs reached 0.1% and was reduced by 70.2% at the 
      highest concentration of 1% MPs compared to control. The half-maximal effective 
      concentration (EC(50)) value based on reproduction for F. candida was 0.29% MPs. At 
      concentrations of 0.5% dry weight in the soil, MPs significantly altered the 
      microbial community and decreased bacterial diversity in the springtail gut. 
      Specifically, the relative abundance of Wolbachia significantly decreased while the 
      relative abundance of Bradyrhizobiaceae, Ensifer and Stenotrophomonas significantly 
      increased. Our results demonstrated that MPs exerted a significant toxic effect on 
      springtails and can change their gut microbial community. This can provide useful 
      information for risk assessment of MPs in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Marine and land plastic debris biodegrades at micro- and nanoscales through 
      progressive fragmentation. Oceanographic model studies confirm the presence of up to 
      ∼2.41 million tons of microplastics across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian 
      subtropical gyres. Microplastics distribute from primary (e.g., exfoliating 
      cleansers) and secondary (e.g., chemical deterioration) sources in the environment. 
      This anthropogenic phenomenon poses a threat to the flora and fauna of terrestrial 
      and aquatic ecosystems as ingestion and entanglement cases increase over time. This 
      review focuses on the impact of microplastics across taxa at suggested 
      environmentally relevant concentrations, and advances the groundwork for future 
      ecotoxicological-based research on microplastics including the main points: (i) 
      adhesion of chemical pollutants (e.g., PCBs); (ii) biological effects (e.g., 
      bioaccumulation, biomagnification, biotransportation) in terrestrial and aquatic 
      organisms; (iii) physico-chemical properties (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers) 
      and biodegradation pathways in the environment (e.g., chemical stress, heat stress); 
      and (iv) an ecotoxicological prospect for optimized impact assessments.

AB  - Plastic trash is common in oceans. Terrestrial and marine ecosystem interactions 
      occur in the intertidal zone where accumulation of plastic frequently occurs. 
      However, knowledge of the plastic-associated microbial community (the plastisphere) 
      in the intertidal zone is scanty. We used high-throughput sequencing to profile the 
      bacterial communities attached to microplastic samples from intertidal locations 
      around the Yangtze estuary in China. The structure and composition of plastisphere 
      communities varied significantly among the locations. We found the taxonomic 
      composition on microplastic samples was related to their sedimentary and aquatic 
      origins. Correlation network analysis was used to identify keystone bacterial genera 
      (e.g. Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales), which represented 
      important microbial associations within the plastisphere community. Other species 
      (i.e. potential pathogens) were considered as hitchhikers in the plastic attached 
      microbial communities. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested adaptations of these 
      bacterial assemblages to the plastic surface-colonization lifestyle. These 
      adaptations included reduced "cell motility" and greater "xenobiotics biodegradation 
      and metabolism." The findings illustrate the diverse microbial assemblages that 
      occur on microplastic and increase our understanding of plastisphere ecology.

AB  - Micro-and nano-plastics (MNPs) (size < 5 mm/<100 nm) epitomize one of the emergent 
      environmental pollutants with its existence all around the globe. Their high 
      persistence nature and release of chemicals/additives used in synthesis of plastics 
      materials may pose cascading impacts on living organism across the globe. Natural 
      connectivity of all the environmental compartments (terrestrial, aquatic, and 
      atmospheric) leads to migration/dispersion of MNPs from one compartment to others. 
      Nevertheless, the information on dispersion of MNPs across the environmental 
      compartments and its possible impacts on living organisms are still missing. This 
      review first acquaints with dispersion mechanisms of MNPs in the environment, its 
      polymeric/oligomeric and chemical constituents and then emphasized its impacts on 
      living organism. Based on the existing knowledge about the MNPs' constituent and its 
      potential impacts on the viability, development, lifecycle, movements, and fertility 
      of living organism via several potential mechanisms, such as irritation, oxidative 
      damage, digestion impairment, tissue deposition, change in gut microbial 
      communities' dynamics, impaired fatty acid metabolism, and molecular damage are 
      emphasized. Finally, at the end, the review provided the challenges associated with 
      remediation of plastics pollutions and desirable strategies, policies required along 
      with substantial gaps in MNPs research were recommended for future studies.

PG  - cox007

AB  - The climate is changing rapidly, and terrestrial ectotherms are expected to be 
      particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and water regime, but also to an 
      increase in extreme weather events in temperate regions. Physiological responses of 
      terrestrial gastropods to climate change are poorly studied. This is surprising, 
      because they are of biodiversity significance among litter-dwelling species, playing 
      important roles in ecosystem function, with numerous species being listed as 
      endangered and requiring efficient conservation management. Through a summary of our 
      ecophysiological work on snail and slug species, we gained some insights into 
      physiological and behavioural responses to climate change that we can organize into 
      the following four threat categories. (i) Winter temperature and snow cover. 
      Terrestrial gastropods use different strategies to survive sub-zero temperatures in 
      buffered refuges, such as the litter or the soil. Absence of the insulating snow 
      cover exposes species to high variability in temperature. The extent of specific 
      cold tolerance might influence the potential of local extinction, but also of 
      invasion. (ii) Drought and high temperature. Physiological responses involve 
      high-cost processes that protect against heat and dehydration. Some species decrease 
      activity periods, thereby reducing foraging and reproduction time. Related costs and 
      physiological limits are expected to increase mortality. (iii) Extreme events. 
      Although some terrestrial gastropod communities can have a good resilience to fire, 
      storms and flooding, an increase in the frequency of those events might lead to 
      community impoverishment. (iv) Habitat loss and fragmentation. Given that 
      terrestrial gastropods are poorly mobile, landscape alteration generally results in 
      an increased risk of local extinction, but responses are highly variable between 
      species, requiring studies at the population level. There is a great need for 
      studies involving non-invasive methods on the plasticity of physiological and 
      behavioural responses and the ability for local adaptation, considering the 
      spatiotemporally heterogeneous climatic landscape, to allow efficient management of 
      ecosystems and conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - Many complex natural and synthetic compounds are degraded by microbial assemblages 
      rather than single strains, due to usually limited metabolic capacities of single 
      organisms. It can therefore be assumed that plastics can be more efficiently 
      degraded by microbial consortia, although this field has not been as widely explored 
      as plastic degradation by individual strains. In this chapter, we present some of 
      the current studies on this topic and methods to enrich and cultivate 
      plastic-degrading microbial consortia from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, 
      including substrate preparation and biodegradation assessment. We focus on both 
      conventional and biodegradable plastics as potential growth substrates. Cultivation 
      methods for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms are presented.

AB  - Intensive exploitation, poor recycling, low repeatable use, and unusual resistance 
      of plastics to environmental and microbiological action result in accumulation of 
      huge waste amounts in terrestrial and marine environments, causing enormous hazard 
      for human and animal life. In the last decades, much scientific interest has been 
      focused on plastic biodegradation. Due to the comparatively short evolutionary 
      period of their appearance in nature, sufficiently effective enzymes for their 
      biodegradation are not available. Plastics are designed for use in conditions 
      typical for human activity, and their physicochemical properties roughly change at 
      extreme environmental parameters like low temperatures, salt, or low or high pH that 
      are typical for the life of extremophilic microorganisms and the activity of their 
      enzymes. This review represents a first attempt to summarize the extraordinarily 
      limited information on biodegradation of conventional synthetic plastics by 
      thermophilic, alkaliphilic, halophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria in natural 
      environments and laboratory conditions. Most of the available data was reported in 
      the last several years and concerns moderate extremophiles. Two main questions are 
      highlighted in it: which extremophilic bacteria and their enzymes are reported to be 
      involved in the degradation of different synthetic plastics, and what could be the 
      impact of extremophiles in future technologies for resolving of pollution problems.

AB  - Enchytraeus albidus is a terrestrial earthworm widespread along the coasts of 
      northern Europe and the Arctic. This species tolerates freezing of body fluids and 
      survives winters in a frozen state. Their acclimatory physiological mechanisms 
      behind freeze tolerance involve increased fluidity of membrane lipids during cold 
      exposure and accumulation of cryoprotectants (glucose) during the freezing process. 
      Gene regulatory processes of these physiological responses have not been studied, 
      partly because no gene expression tools were developed. The main aim of this study 
      was to understand whether the freeze tolerance mechanisms have a transcriptomic 
      basis in E. albidus. For that purpose, first the transcriptome of E. albidus was 
      assembled with RNAseq data. Second, two strains from contrasting thermal 
      environments (Germany and Greenland) were compared by mapping barcoded RNAseq data 
      onto the assembled transcriptome. Both of these strains are freeze tolerant, but 
      Greenland is extremely freeze tolerant. Results showed more plastic responses in the 
      Greenland strain as well as higher constitutive expression of particular stress 
      response genes. These altered transcriptional networks are associated with an 
      adapted homeostasis coping with prolonged freezing conditions in Greenland animals. 
      Previously identified physiological alterations in freeze-tolerant strains of 
      E. albidus are underpinned at the transcriptome level. These processes involve anion 
      transport in the hemolymph, fatty acid metabolism, metabolism, and transport of 
      cryoprotective sugars as well as protection against oxidative stress. Pathway 
      analysis supported most of these processes, and identified additional differentially 
      expressed pathways such as peroxisome and Toll-like receptor signaling. We propose 
      that the freeze-tolerant phenotype is the consequence of genetic adaptation to cold 
      stress and may have driven evolutionary divergence of the two strains.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution in terrestrial ecosystems has aroused great concern. 
      However, little is known regarding the distribution of MPs in Sand Land soils and 
      their associated destinies. We investigated the MPs pollution in different areas, 
      different vegetation cover and restoration years in Mu Us Sand Land soils. The 
      results clearly showed that the soils of Mu Us Sand Land contain a relatively higher 
      MPs abundance. The significant differences of MPs abundance were demonstrated among 
      soil from sand, grassland and woodland, which the total MP abundance of sand soil 
      was higher than that of grassland and woodland. The distribution of MP size in the 
      woodland area primarily from 0 to 0.50 mm, which is significantly higher than that 
      other areas. In addition, the highest concentration of MP collected was found at 
      Salix tree (ST), followed by Poplar tree (PT) and Chinese pine (CP), while the 
      lowest concentration was at Pinus sylvestris (PSs) and Jujube tree (JT). It is worth 
      noting that the abundance of MPs decreases with restoration years increased, whether 
      it is PT or PSs. We speculate that the tree disturbance in the sampling area might 
      affect the distribution of microplastics and then be conducive to plastic 
      fragmentation.

AB  - In this study, the hypothesis that polyethylene microplastics (MPs) can accumulate 
      in animals, reach the upper trophic level and trigger behavioral changes was tested. 
      Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles were exposed to MPs (for 7 days) and fed on tambatinga 
      fish for the same period. Subsequently, these fish were given as food to Swiss mice. 
      The MP amount in animals' liver was quantified and results have evidenced its 
      accumulation at all assessed trophic levels [tadpole: 18,201.9 particles/g; fish: 
      1.26 particles/g; mice receiving tambatingas who had fed on tadpoles exposed to MPs: 
      57.07 particles/g and mice receiving water added with MPs: 89.12 particles/g). Such 
      accumulation in the last group was associated with shorter traveled distance, slower 
      locomotion speed and higher anxiety index in the open field test. Mice receiving 
      tambatingas who had fed on tadpoles exposed to MPs were confronted to a potential 
      predator and showed responses similar to those of animals who had ingested water 
      added with MPs (lack of defensive social aggregation and reduced risk assessment 
      behavior). Thus, results have preliminarily confirmed the initial hypothesis about 
      how MPs in water can reach terrestrial trophic levels and have negative impact on 
      the survival of these animals.

TI  - Biomechanical responses of aquatic plants to aerial conditions.
PG  - 1869-78
LID - 10.1093/aob/mct221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Wetlands are impacted by changes in hydrological regimes that 
      can lead to periods of low water levels. During these periods, aquatic plants 
      experience a drastic change in the mechanical conditions that they encounter, from 
      low gravitational and tensile hydrodynamic forces when exposed to flow under aquatic 
      conditions, to high gravitational and bending forces under terrestrial conditions. 
      The objective of this study was to test the capacity of aquatic plants to produce 
      self-supporting growth forms when growing under aerial conditions by assessing their 
      resistance to terrestrial mechanical conditions and the associated morpho-anatomical 
      changes. METHODS: Plastic responses to aerial conditions were assessed by sampling 
      Berula erecta, Hippuris vulgaris, Juncus articulatus, Lythrum salicaria, Mentha 
      aquatica, Myosotis scorpioides, Nuphar lutea and Sparganium emersum under submerged 
      and emergent conditions. The cross-sectional area and dry matter content (DMC) were 
      measured in the plant organs that bear the mechanical forces, and their 
      biomechanical properties in tension and bending were assessed. KEY RESULTS: All of 
      the species except for two had significantly higher stiffness in bending and thus an 
      increased resistance to terrestrial mechanical conditions when growing under 
      emergent conditions. This response was determined either by an increased allocation 
      to strengthening tissues and thus a higher DMC, or by an increased cross-sectional 
      area. These morpho-anatomical changes also resulted in increased strength and 
      stiffness in tension. CONCLUSIONS: The capacity of the studied species to colonize 
      this fluctuating environment can be accounted for by a high degree of phenotypic 
      plasticity in response to emersion. Further investigation is however needed to 
      disentangle the finer mechanisms behind these responses (e.g. allometric relations, 
      tissue make-up), their costs and adaptive value.

TI  - PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs in albatross from the North Pacific and Southern 
      Oceans: levels, patterns, and toxicological implications.
PG  - 403-13
AB  - Concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated 
      dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (coplanar PCBs) were 
      determined in five albatross species collected from the North Pacific and Southern 
      Oceans to assess the north-south differences in residue levels, accumulation 
      patterns, and toxic potential. Black-footed and Laysan albatrosses from the North 
      Pacific Ocean contained higher levels of PCDD/Fs and coplanar PCBs than albatrosses 
      from the Southern Ocean, indicating that emission sources of these contaminants were 
      predominant in the northern hemisphere. Residue levels in albatrosses from the 
      remote North Pacific Ocean far from the point source of pollution were comparable to 
      or higher than those in terrestrial and coastal birds from contaminated areas in 
      developed nations, suggesting the specific exposure and accumulation of PCDD/Fs and 
      coplanar PCBs in albatross. The long life span and ingestion of plastic resin 
      pellets by albatrosses could be the plausible explanations for the elevated 
      accumulation of persistent and lipophilic contaminants including PCDD/Fs and 
      coplanar PCBs in these birds. Relative proportions of PCDFs and coplanar PCBs in 
      albatross were higher than those observed in birds inhabiting terrestrial and 
      coastal areas, suggesting that these toxic chemicals may have higher 
      transportability by air and water than PCDDs. Congener patterns of PCDD/Fs in 
      albatross showed less variability as compared to those in terrestrial species, 
      indicating that contamination patterns of PCDD/Fs were similar within the open ocean 
      environment. Contributions of PCDD/Fs to total TEQs in albatrosses from the open 
      ocean were generally lower than those in terrestrial birds, suggesting different 
      toxic potency of PCDD/Fs and coplanar PCBs on animals inhabiting open ocean and 
      terrestrial environment. Whereas albatrosses from southern oceans retained lower TEQ 
      concentrations, possible adverse effects of PCDD/Fs and coplanar PCBs to 
      black-footed and Laysan albatrosses of the North Pacific Ocean may be suspected from 
      TEQ levels.

TI  - Responses of Leptinaria unilamellata (Gastropoda: Subulinidae) to Novel 
      Micro-Environmental Conditions: Shift in Shell Morphology and the Balance between 
      Protection against Desiccation and Reproductive Success.
PG  - 148-158
LID - 10.2108/zs180201 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we observed that Leptinaria unilamellata responds to changes 
      in microclimatic conditions through shifts in shell morphology. Over three 
      laboratory generations, shell differences between two populations, representing 
      distinct morphotypes, became less evident. Only F1 generations from both populations 
      showed shell morphometry very similar to the field parental snails, suggesting 
      maternal effect. Snails from the locality with higher values of rainfall, relative 
      humidity and evaporation index and smaller values of temperature and insolation 
      produced more and larger hatchlings. Snails from the locality with less favorable 
      climatic conditions presented shells traits that offer protection against 
      desiccation, but reduce reproductive success. These snails showed smaller offspring 
      production and faster response to a desiccation regime, through changes in 
      conchiometrics. In addition, the results of the present study suggest that the spire 
      index plays a less important role in determining protective properties of the shell 
      of L. unilamellata, in response to desiccation risk, compared to aperture dimension. 
      As shell aperture dimension is an important trait related to resistance to 
      desiccation, and at the same time to reproduction, plastic responses to

TI  - Underwater photosynthesis in flooded terrestrial plants: a matter of leaf 
      plasticity.
PG  - 581-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flooding causes substantial stress for terrestrial plants, particularly 
      if the floodwater completely submerges the shoot. The main problems during 
      submergence are shortage of oxygen due to the slow diffusion rates of gases in 
      water, and depletion of carbohydrates, which is the substrate for respiration. These 
      two factors together lead to loss of biomass and eventually death of the submerged 
      plants. Although conditions under water are unfavourable with respect to light and 
      carbon dioxide supply, photosynthesis may provide both oxygen and carbohydrates, 
      resulting in continuation of aerobic respiration. SCOPE: This review focuses on 
      evidence in the literature that photosynthesis contributes to survival of 
      terrestrial plants during complete submergence. Furthermore, we discuss relevant 
      morphological and physiological responses of the shoot of terrestrial plant species 
      that enable the positive effects of light on underwater plant performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Light increases the survival of terrestrial plants under water, 
      indicating that photosynthesis commonly occurs under these submerged conditions. 
      Such underwater photosynthesis increases both internal oxygen concentrations and 
      carbohydrate contents, compared with plants submerged in the dark, and thereby 
      alleviates the adverse effects of flooding. Additionally, several terrestrial 
      species show high plasticity with respect to their leaf development. In a number of 
      species, leaf morphology changes in response to submergence, probably to facilitate 
      underwater gas exchange. Such increased gas exchange may result in higher 
      assimilation rates, and lower carbon dioxide compensation points under water, which 
      is particularly important at the low carbon dioxide concentrations observed in the 
      field. As a result of higher internal carbon dioxide concentrations in 
      submergence-acclimated plants, underwater photorespiration rates are expected to be 
      lower than in non-acclimated plants. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms that 
      induce the switch from terrestrial to submergence-acclimated leaves may be 
      controlled by the same pathways as described for heterophyllous aquatic plants.

AB  - Pollution of marine environments with microplastic particles (i.e. plastic fragments 
      <5 mm) has increased rapidly during the last decades. As these particles are mainly 
      of terrestrial origin, coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs are particularly 
      threatened. Recent studies revealed that microplastic ingestion can have adverse 
      effects on marine invertebrates. However, little is known about its effects on 
      small-polyp stony corals that are the main framework builders in coral reefs. The 
      goal of this study is to characterise how different coral species I) respond to 
      microplastic particles and whether the exposure might II) lead to health effects. 
      Therefore, six small-polyp stony coral species belonging to the genera Acropora, 
      Pocillopora, and Porites were exposed to microplastics (polyethylene, size 
      37-163 μm, concentration ca. 4000 particles L(-1)) over four weeks, and responses 
      and effects on health were documented. The study showed that the corals responded 
      differentially to microplastics. Cleaning mechanisms (direct interaction, mucus 
      production) but also feeding interactions (i.e. interaction with mesenterial 
      filaments, ingestion, and egestion) were observed. Additionally, passive contact 
      through overgrowth was documented. In five of the six studied species, negative 
      effects on health (i.e. bleaching and tissue necrosis) were reported. We here 
      provide preliminary knowledge about coral-microplastic-interactions. The results 
      call for further investigations of the effects of realistic microplastic 
      concentrations on growth, reproduction, and survival of stony corals. This might 
      lead to a better understanding of resilience capacities in coral reef ecosystems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generalist predators may vary their diet and use of habitat according to 
      both internal state (e.g. breeding stage) and external (e.g. weather) factors. 
      Lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus (Linnaeus 1758) are dietary generalists, 
      foraging in both terrestrial and marine habitats during breeding. We investigate 
      what affects the gulls' propensity to forage at sea or on land. We assess the 
      importance of terrestrial foraging to gulls in the Baltic Sea (sub. sp. L. f. 
      fuscus), looking especially at their use of agricultural fields. RESULTS: Through 
      the GPS tracking of 19 individuals across 3 years we tracked 1038 foraging trips and 
      found that 21.2 % of foraging trips were predominantly terrestrial, 9.0 % were a mix 
      of terrestrial and marine, and 68.5 % were exclusively marine. Terrestrial trips 
      were (1) more frequent when departing around sunrise, whereas marine trips occurred 
      throughout the day. Additionally, trips with mostly land-based foraging decreased as 
      the breeding season progressed, suggesting dietary switching coincident with the 
      onset of chick provisioning. (2) During cloudy and cold conditions terrestrial 
      foraging trips were more likely. (3) We found no differences between sexes in their 
      land-based foraging strategy. (4) Gull individuals showed great variation in 
      foraging strategy. Using observations of agricultural fields, carried out for one 
      year, we found that (5) gulls preferentially foraged on fields with short 
      vegetation, and there was a positive association with occurrence of waders and other 
      species of gulls. (6) The availability and use of these preferred fields decreased 
      through the breeding period. CONCLUSIONS: This study found high prevalence of 
      terrestrial foraging during early breeding as well as support for dietary switching 
      early in the breeding season. The overall tendency for marine or terrestrial 
      foraging was consistent within individuals, with gull identity accounting for much 
      of the variation observed in foraging trips. Our results suggest that anthropogenic 
      terrestrial food sources may play a role in the low breeding success of these gulls 
      through either variation in quantity and/or quality. Finally, our study demonstrates 
      the potential of combining data from GPS-tracking of individual animals with the 
      'ground-truthing' of habitat visited to elucidate the otherwise nebulous behavior of 
      a generalist predator.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution continues to proliferate in freshwater, marine and 
      terrestrial environments, but with their biotic implications remaining poorly 
      understood. Biotic interactions such as predation can profoundly influence ecosystem 
      structuring, stability and functioning. However, we currently lack quantitative 
      understandings of how trophic interaction strengths and associated behaviours are 
      influenced by MP pollution, and how transference of MPs between trophic levels 
      relates to consumptive traits. We also lack understanding of key life-history 
      effects of MPs, for example, reproductive strategies such as oviposition. The 
      present study examines the predatory ability of non-biting midge larvae, Chaoborus 
      flavicans, towards larvae of Culex pipiens mosquitoes when the latter are exposed to 
      MPs, using a functional response (FR) approach. Transfer of MPs occurred from larval 
      mosquitoes to larval midges via predation. Microplastics transfer was significantly 
      positively related to predation rates. Predation by C. flavicans followed a Type II 
      FR, with average maximum feeding rates of 6.2 mosquito larvae per hour. These and 
      other FR parameters (attack rates and handling times) were not significantly 
      influenced by the presence of MPs. Further, C. pipiens adults did not avoid 
      ovipositing in habitats with high concentrations of MPs. We thus demonstrate that 
      MPs can move readily through freshwater food webs via biotic processes such as 
      predation, and that uptake correlates strongly with consumption rates. Further, as 
      MPs do not deter adult mosquitoes from ovipositing, our experiments reveal high 
      potential for MP exposure and transference through ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of Polyvinyl Chloride Microplastics on Bacterial Community and Nutrient 
      Status in Two Agricultural Soils.
LID - 10.1007/s00128-020-02900-2 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge of the influence of microplastics on soil microbiome and nutrients is 
      important for understanding the ecological consequences of microplastic pollution in 
      terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we investigated whether polyvinyl chloride 
      (PVC) microplastic pollution at environmentally relevant concentrations would affect 
      soil bacterial community and available nitrogen/phosphorus content. The results 
      showed that although PVC microplastics at 0.1% and 1% levels did not have a 
      significant effect on overall bacterial community diversity and composition in soil 
      over the course of 35 days, a number of bacterial genera were significantly reduced 
      or enriched by the presence of microplastics. Potentially due to their effect on 
      certain functional groups, microplastics caused a significant change in soil 
      available P content. It is noteworthy that, depending on soil type, pollution level 
      and plasticizer presence, contrasting effects of microplastics may be observed. 
      Further research is definitely warranted to gain a clearer picture of the threats 
      posed by microplastic pollution in soil environments.

AB  - Cigarette filters (butts) are currently the most abundant form of anthropogenic 
      litter on the planet, yet we know very little about their environmental impacts on 
      terrestrial ecosystems, including plant germination and primary production. When 
      discarded, filters contain a myriad of chemicals resulting from smoking tobacco and 
      some still contain unsmoked remnants. A greenhouse experiment was used to assess the 
      impacts of discarded filters of regular or menthol cigarette, either from unsmoked, 
      smoked, or smoked cigarettes with remnant tobacco, on the growth and development of 
      Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Trifolium repens (white clover). After 21 
      days, shoot length and germination success were significantly reduced by exposure to 
      any type of cigarette filter for the grass and clover. Although total grass biomass 
      was not measurably affected, the root biomass and root:shoot ratio were less in the 
      clover when exposed to filters from smoked regular cigarettes and those with remnant 
      tobacco. Cigarette filters caused an increase in chlorophyll-a in clover shoots and 
      an increase in chlorophyll-b in grass shoots. Accordingly, whilst the chlorophyll 
      a:b ratio was increased in the clover exposed to cigarette filters, it was decreased 
      in grass. This study indicates the potential for littered cigarette filters to 
      reduce growth and alter short-term primary productivity of terrestrial plants.

AB  - Green algal species of spherical cell shape are generally considered to belong to 
      the genus Chlorella, which are mostly freshwater or terrestrial organisms. 
      Phylogenetic studies have shown that this genus is polyphyletic and belongs to 
      different classes. However, until now, only freshwater or terrestrial strains have 
      been studied. Here we investigated 11 strains of 'marine' Chlorella deposited in 
      public culture collections, which we studied using an integrative approach. These 
      strains were largely isolated from marine rock pools and brackish estuaries. SSU and 
      ITS regions of the nuclear encoded ribosomal DNA were sequenced, ribosomal secondary 
      structures were analysed and cell morphology, salinity tolerance and reproduction 
      were examined. Our results showed that the marine strains are also of polyphyletic 
      origin. Surprisingly, three marine isolates belong to Chlorella vulgaris according 
      to the phylogenetic analyses, but showed a high phenotypic plasticity. Whereas these 
      strains showed the typical morphology of C. vulgaris under freshwater conditions, 
      they increased the cell shape and formed cell packages under marine conditions. In 
      contrast, the other investigated strains showed no changes after changing the media. 
      Two of the investigated strains belong to the genus Chloroidium, and those remaining 
      represent a new genus, Droopiella.

AB  - Sustainable alternatives to landfill disposal for municipal mixed wastes represents 
      a major challenge to governments and waste management industries. In the state of 
      New South Wales (NSW) Australia, mechanical biological treatment (MBT) is being used 
      to reduce the volume and pathogen content of organic matter isolated from municipal 
      waste. The product of this treatment, a compost-like output (CLO) referred to as 
      mixed waste organic output (MWOO), is being recycled and applied as a soil 
      amendment. However, the presence of contaminants in MWOO including trace organics, 
      trace metals and physical contaminants such as microplastic fragments has raised 
      concerns about potential negative effects on soil health and agriculture following 
      land application. Here, we used multiple lines of evidence to examine the effects of 
      land application of MWOO containing microplastics in three soils to a variety of 
      terrestrial biota. Treatments included unamended soil, MWOO-amended soil and 
      MWOO-amended soil into which additional high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 
      polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics were 
      added. Tests were conducted in soil media that had been incubated for 0, 3 or 9 
      months. Addition of microplastics had no significant negative effect on wheat 
      seedling emergence, wheat biomass production, earthworm growth, mortality or 
      avoidance behaviour and nematode mortality or reproduction compared to controls. 
      There was also little evidence the microplastics affected microbial community 
      diversity, although measurements of microbial community structure were highly 
      variable with no clear trends.

AB  - Plastic debris is widespread in the environment, but information on the effects of 
      microplastics on terrestrial fauna is completely lacking. Here, we studied the 
      survival and fitness of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (Oligochaeta, 
      Lumbricidae) exposed to microplastics (Polyethylene, <150 μm) in litter at 
      concentrations of 7, 28, 45, and 60% dry weight, percentages that, after 
      bioturbation, translate to 0.2 to 1.2% in bulk soil. Mortality after 60 days was 
      higher at 28, 45, and 60% of microplastics in the litter than at 7% w/w and in the 
      control (0%). Growth rate was significantly reduced at 28, 45, and 60% w/w 
      microplastics, compared to the 7% and control treatments. Due to the digestion of 
      ingested organic matter, microplastic was concentrated in cast, especially at the 
      lowest dose (i.e., 7% in litter) because that dose had the highest proportion of 
      digestible organic matter. Whereas 50 percent of the microplastics had a size of <50 
      μm in the original litter, 90 percent of the microplastics in the casts was <50 μm 
      in all treatments, which suggests size-selective egestion by the earthworms. These 
      concentration-transport and size-selection mechanisms may have important 
      implications for fate and risk of microplastic in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - The potential threats of microplastics to global health are a new problem. However, 
      little is known about the influence of microplastics on soil organisms. Here, we 
      investigated the effects of low-density polyethylene (LDPE, < 400 μm) on earthworms 
      (Eisenia fetida) under different concentrations (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 g/kg dry) 
      with three replicates in artificial soil. Results showed that surface damage of 
      earthworms was observed at the concentration of 1.5 g/kg LDPE after exposure 28 
      days. The microplastics were ingested in a dose-response manner. Smaller sizes of 
      LDPE microplastics were found in the casts of E. fetida, and approximately 30% of 
      the microplastics egested (size < 100 μm) were increased compared with initial 
      microplastics in the soil. The catalase activity and malondialdehyde content 
      increased significantly at the concentration of 1.0 g/kg LDPE after exposure 28 
      days, and acetylcholine esterase was significantly stimulated at concentrations of 
      1.5 and 1.0 g/kg LDPE on days 21 and 28, respectively. The results of this study 
      demonstrate the potential risk of LDPE microplastics to E. fetida and may provide a 
      reference for the impact of microplastics on terrestrial creatures.

AB  - Phthalate esters (PAEs), a family of emerging environmental contaminants, have been 
      frequently detected in soils and water. However, intensive studies on the toxicity 
      of PAEs have focused on growth response of terrestrial and aquatic animals, while 
      only limited attention has been paid to aquatic plants, especially phytoplankton, 
      the primary producer in aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, the acute toxic effects and 
      underlying mechanisms of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at different concentrations 
      (0-20mgL(-1)) on two typical freshwater algae (Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella 
      pyrenoidosa) were investigated. The growth of S. obliquus and C. pyrenoidosa was 
      conspicuously inhibited by DBP exposure at 2-20mgL(-1). The 96-h median effective 
      concentration values (96h-EC(50)) were 15.3mgL(-1) and 3.14mgL(-1) for S. obliquus 
      and C. pyrenoidosa, respectively, implying that the spherical C. pyrenoidosa is more 
      sensitive to DBP than the spindle-shaped S. obliquus. As expected from the damage 
      done to cell organelles (i.e. cell membranes, chloroplasts, and protein rings), cell 
      densities and chlorophyll content conspicuously decreased under DBP treatments. 
      Moreover, the algal growth inhibition was closely linked to the increased production 
      of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content, indicating 
      oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in both algae. This was proved by the 
      increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. 
      Our findings will contribute to the understanding of toxic mechanisms in PAEs and 
      the evaluation of environmental risks for primary producers in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Studies on microplastic (MP) pollution in lakes are recent, although the problem of 
      MP particles in the oceans was first discovered in the 1970s. The first study on 
      lakes was published in 2011. Since then, to our knowledge, 98 lakes have been 
      investigated worldwide. In recent years, studies on this topic have increased 
      worldwide, particularly those focusing on urbanised lakes. Most of the plastic waste 
      in the seas and oceans originates from the terrestrial environment and inland 
      waters. Moreover, lakes are potential temporary or long-term MP accumulators, 
      according to the residence time of water. They are also of high interest for 
      biodiversity, ecology, and the economy. Lacustrine ecosystems may suffer the same 
      fate as marine ecosystems, or even worse, owing to their greater exposure. With the 
      significant focus on ocean and sea contamination, contamination of freshwater 
      ecosystems and lakes is a new and rising topic. However, as a new field of research, 
      several methodological issues have been raised. The team diversity worldwide has led 
      to contrasting sampling techniques and materials, sample treatments, analyses, and 
      presentation of results. Consequently, it is necessary to determine several 
      consensuses between scientific teams in order to work together with accuracy, 
      produce comparable results, speed up knowledge sharing and reduce the 
      reproducibility crisis. This review focuses on (1) MP contamination in 98 worldwide 
      lakes. We identify (2) the theoretical sources of MPs and provide (3) an estimate of 
      MP pollution in different compartments of the lakes based on current 
      state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also report (4) the predominant MP size 
      classes and polymer types. Finally, we suggest (5) several recommendations to build 
      a consensus between all the working teams to facilitate decision-making by public 
      authorities.

AB  - Microplastics are increasingly entering marine, limnic and terrestrial ecosystems 
      worldwide, where they sorb hydrophobic organic contaminants. Here, the sorption 
      behavior of the fuel-related water contaminants benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and 
      xylene (BTEX) and four tertiary butyl ethers to virgin and via UV radiation aged 
      polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) pellets was investigated. Changes in 
      material properties due to aging were recorded using appropriate polymer 
      characterization methods, such as differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier 
      transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, X-ray photoelectron 
      spectroscopy, and microscopy. Pellets were exposed to water containing BTEX and the 
      ethers at 130-190 μg L(-1) for up to two weeks. Aqueous sorbate concentrations were 
      determined by headspace gas chromatography. Sorption to the polymers was correlated 
      with the sorbate's K(ow) and was significant for BTEX and marginal for the ethers. 
      Due to substantially lower glass transition temperatures, PP showed higher sorption 
      than PS. Aging had no effect on the sorption behavior of PP. PS sorbed less BTEX 
      after aging due to an oxidized surface layer.

AB  - This paper presents the research landscape on microplastics and nanoplastics (M/NPs) 
      in global food webs based on a bibliometric analysis of 330 publications published 
      in 2009-2019 extracted from Web of Science. The publications increased tremendously 
      since 2013. Marine Pollution Bulletin is one of the top productive journals for this 
      topic. The publication landscape related to M/NPs in global food webs, as 
      interdisciplinary research, is highly dependent on the funding availability. The 
      high productivities of England, China, USA and European countries are attributed to 
      the funding from the agencies at regional or national levels. Keyword analysis 
      reveals the shift of research hotspots from investigations on M/NPs absorbed by 
      various organisms in the ecosystems to studies on the trophic transfer of M/NPs and 
      sorbed contaminants in the food webs and their associated adverse impacts. Funding 
      agencies play important roles in leading the future development of this topic.

AB  - Despite numerous studies on microplastics (MPs), little attention has been paid to 
      the dissolved organic substances leached from MPs and their environmental fate. In 
      this study, we explored the copper-binding characteristics of MP-derived dissolved 
      organic matter (MP-DOM) leached from several MP types, including commercial 
      polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, and expanded polystyrene, under dark and UV 
      irradiation conditions. The copper-binding affinity of MP-DOM was examined using 
      fluorescence quenching method based on different fluorophores identified via the 
      excitation emission matrix-parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). The heterogeneous 
      distribution of binding sites across the functional groups of MP-DOM was further 
      elucidated by utilizing two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) based on 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Phenol/protein-like fluorescence 
      prevailed in all MP-DOM samples, whereas humic-like fluorescence was more pronounced 
      in the irradiated MP-DOM. For all tested plastic types, two plastic-derived 
      fluorescent components (C2 and C3) exhibited substantial fluorescence quenching with 
      increasing copper concentrations. The calculated stability constants showed larger 
      differences between the two leaching conditions than between the three MP types with 
      higher log K(M) values for the UV-irradiated (4.08-5.36) than dark-treated MP-DOM 
      (1.05-3.60). The binding constants were comparable to those of natural organic 
      matter with aquatic/terrestrial origins. The 2D-COS results further revealed that 
      the oxygen-containing structures in MP-DOM generated by UV irradiation might be 
      responsible for the higher binding affinity of the irradiated MP-DOM. This is the 
      first study demonstrating the environmental reactivity of MP-DOM towards metal 
      binding, highlighting the importance of leaching conditions for the metal-binding 
      behavior of MP-DOM.

AB  - Plastic pollution has become a globally pressing environmental issue. In birds, 
      plastic may cause harm by entangling or ingestion when used for nesting. The use of 
      anthropogenic nesting material has so far been mostly studied in birds of 
      terrestrial or marine habitats, but there are yet very few reports for inland 
      water-associated birds. The aim of this study is to better understand the extension 
      and magnitude of the use of anthropogenic debris as nesting material by the greater 
      thornbird (Phacellodomus ruber), a bird species preferably nesting in river 
      floodplain wetlands in South America. We found that P. ruber uses disproportionally 
      large quantities of plastic debris as nesting material (more than 90% of some nest 
      chambers is plastic). This occurred even if ample vegetation (commonly used as soft 
      material) was available. Most of the artificial nesting material was derived from 
      wrapping material released into the environment. We suggest that this species has 
      the potential to indicate vulnerable areas to plastic pollution associated with 
      urban waste mismanagement.

TI  - Temperature-dependent oxygen limitation and the rise of Bergmann's rule in species

PG  - 977-988
LID - 10.1111/evo.13458 [doi]
AB  - Bergmann's rule is the propensity for species-mean body size to decrease with 
      increasing temperature. Temperature-dependent oxygen limitation has been 
      hypothesized to help drive temperature-size relationships among ectotherms, 
      including Bergmann's rule, where organisms reduce body size under warm 
      oxygen-limited conditions, thereby maintaining aerobic scope. Temperature-dependent 
      oxygen limitation should be most pronounced among aquatic ectotherms that cannot 
      breathe aerially, as oxygen solubility in water decreases with increasing 
      temperature. We use phylogenetically explicit analyses to show that species-mean 
      adult size of aquatic salamanders with branchial or cutaneous oxygen uptake becomes 
      small in warm environments and large in cool environments, whereas body size of 
      aquatic species with lungs (i.e., that respire aerially), as well as size of 
      semiaquatic and terrestrial species do not decrease with temperature. We argue that 
      oxygen limitation drives the evolution of small size in warm aquatic environments 
      for species with aquatic respiration. More broadly, the stronger decline in size 
      with temperature observed in aquatic versus terrestrial salamander species mirrors 
      the relatively strong plastic declines in size observed previously among aquatic 
      versus terrestrial invertebrates, suggesting that temperature-dependent oxygen 
      availability can help drive patterns of plasticity, micro- and macroevolution.

AB  - Among ectothermic reptiles, the order Squamata has adapted most successfully to the 
      terrestrial environment. However, the physiological background of this success 
      remains unknown. Since the regulation of energy metabolism provides an important 
      insight into terrestrial adaption by ectothermic animals, we focused on 
      proglucagon-derived peptides (PGDPs). In the process of cloning proglucagon mRNA in 
      geckos, we identified several novel proglucagon (PG) cDNA isoforms. They were 
      tissue-specifically and strongly expressed in the pancreas and small intestine of 
      the geckos, suggesting their biological relevance. Therefore, in order to clarify 
      whether these novel cDNA isoforms are phylogenetically conserved, we performed the 
      additional molecular characterization of proglucagon cDNAs from several 
      representative species of the Squamata and Testudine clade and examined the 
      expression of proglucagon mRNAs in the small intestine and pancreas. In the present 
      study, a total of 7 proglucagon cDNA isoforms were identified and divided into two 
      groups (Classes A and B) based on the 3'-UTR sequence of each isoform. The longest 
      isoform of each group (named PG-A(1) and PG-B(1), respectively) had the same 
      molecular characteristics as those previously reported from chickens and reptiles, 
      namely, PG-A and PG-B. Other 5 isoforms were novel-type cDNAs, and were the products 
      of exon skipping (named PG-A(2), PG-A(2s), PG-B(2), PG-B(2s), and PG-B(3)). Some of 
      these isoforms coded for only one peptide hormone (GLP-1 or GLP-2). This is the 
      first identification of single hormone-encoding proglucagon cDNAs in vertebrates. 
      Moreover, an expression analysis of these isoforms revealed that single 
      hormone-encoding proglucagon mRNAs were predominantly expressed with tissue and 
      lineage specificities in the reptile clade. Collectively, the present results 
      suggest an independent regulatory system for GLP-1 and GLP-2 secretion and indicate 
      the plasticity of proglucagon genes in expressing different isoforms in different 
      tissues in Squamata. These results also provide insights into the plastic energy 
      metabolic system of Squamata in accordance with various habitats in the terrestrial 
      environment, supporting their successful prosperity.

AB  - Microplastic pollution has become an emergency issue in the global environment. 
      However, little is known about the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in 
      agroecological system. In this study, we investigated the pollution of microplastics 
      in vegetable farmlands in suburb of Wuhan, central China. Results showed that the 
      abundance of microplastics ranged from 320 to 12,560 items/kg(dw.) Microplastic 
      pollution adjacent to the suburban roads was about 1.8 times as serious as that in 
      the residential areas. Microplastics with size less than 0.2 mm were dominated, 
      reaching 70% in total. The main types of microplastics were fibers and microbeads. 
      Moreover, polyamide (32.5%) and polypropylene (28.8%) were the main types of 
      polymer. This study proclaims the occurrence and characteristics of microplastic 
      pollution in typical farmland soils of suburb land. It may provide significant basis 
      for subsequent research about microplastics contaminant in the terrestrial 
      ecosystem.

TI  - Cutin from agro-waste as a raw material for the production of bioplastics.
PG  - 5401-5410
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erx272 [doi]
AB  - Cutin is the main component of plant cuticles constituting the framework that 
      supports the rest of the cuticle components. This biopolymer is composed of 
      esterified bi- and trifunctional fatty acids. Despite its ubiquity in terrestrial 
      plants, it has been underutilized as raw material due to its insolubility and lack 
      of melting point. However, in recent years, a few technologies have been developed 
      to obtain cutin monomers from several agro-wastes at an industrial scale. This 
      review is focused on the description of cutin properties, biodegradability, chemical 
      composition, processability, abundance, and the state of art of the fabrication of 
      cutin-based materials in order to evaluate whether this biopolymer can be considered 
      a source for the production of renewable materials.

TI  - Neuronal plasticity: adaptation and readaptation to the environment of space.
PG  - 61-5
AB  - While there have been few documented permanent neurological changes resulting from 
      space travel, there is a growing literature which suggests that neural plasticity 
      sometimes occurs within peripheral and central vestibular pathways during and 
      following spaceflight. This plasticity probably has adaptive value within the 
      context of the space environment, but it can be maladaptive upon return to the 
      terrestrial environment. Fortunately, the maladaptive responses resulting from 
      neuronal plasticity diminish following return to earth. However, the literature 
      suggests that the longer the space travel, the more difficult the readaptation. With 
      the possibility of extended space voyages and extended stays on board the 
      international space station, it seems worthwhile to review examples of plastic 
      vestibular responses and changes in the underlying neural substrates. Studies and 
      facilities needed for space station investigation of plastic changes in the neural 
      substrates are suggested.

TI  - Exploring the impacts of plastics in soil - The effects of polyester textile fibers 
      on soil invertebrates.

AB  - Polyester fiber is one of the most abundant types of microplastics in the 
      environment. A major proportion of the fibers entering wastewater treatment plants 
      end up in sewage sludge, which is used as a soil fertilizer in many countries. As 
      their impacts in the terrestrial environment are still poorly understood, we studied 
      the effects of polyester fibers on enchytraeids (Enchytraeus crypticus), springtails 
      (Folsomia candida), isopods (Porcellio scaber) and oribatid mites (Oppia nitens), 
      all playing an important role in soil decomposer food webs. We exposed these 
      invertebrates in the laboratory to short (12 µm-2.87 mm) and long (4-24 mm) 
      polyester fibers, spiked in soil or in food at five concentrations ranging from 
      0.02% to 1.5% (w/w) and using five replicates. Overall the effects of polyester 
      fibers on the soil invertebrates were slight. Energy reserves of the isopods were 
      slightly affected by both fiber types, and enchytraeid reproduction decreased up to 
      30% with increasing fiber concentration, but only for long fibers in soil. The low 
      ingestion of long fibers by the enchytraeids suggests that this negative impact 
      arose from a physical harm outside the organism, or from indirect effects resulting 
      from changes in environmental conditions. The short fibers were clearly ingested by 
      enchytraeids and isopods, with the rate of ingestion positively related to fiber 
      concentration in the soil. This study shows that polyester fibers are not very 
      harmful to soil invertebrates upon short-term exposure. However, longer lasting, 
      multigeneration studies with functional endpoints are needed to reveal the possible 
      long-term effects on soil invertebrates and their role in the decomposition process. 
      This study also shows that polyester fibers can enter terrestrial food web via 
      ingestion of fibers by soil invertebrates.

TI  - Microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems: Moving beyond the state of the art to 
      minimize the risk of ecological surprise.
LID - 10.1111/gcb.15724 [doi]
AB  - Microplastic (plastic particles measuring <5mm) pollution is ubiquitous. Unlike in 
      other well-studied ecosystems, for example, marine and freshwater environments, 
      microplastics in terrestrial systems are relatively understudied. Their potential 
      impacts on terrestrial environments, in particular the risk of causing ecological 
      surprise, must be better understood and quantified. Ecological surprise occurs when 
      ecosystem behavior deviates radically from expectations and generally has negative 
      consequences for ecosystem services. The properties and behavior of microplastics 
      within terrestrial environments may increase their likelihood of causing ecological 
      surprises as they (a) are highly persistent global pollutants that will last for 
      centuries, (b) can interact with the abiotic environment in a complex manner, (c) 
      can impact terrestrial organisms directly or indirectly and (d) interact with other 
      contaminants and can facilitate their transport. Here, we compiled findings of 
      previous research on microplastics in terrestrial environments. We systematically 
      focused on studies addressing different facets of microplastics related to their 
      distribution, dispersion, impact on soil characteristics and functions, levels of 
      biological organization of tested terrestrial biota (single species vs. 
      assemblages), scale of experimental study and corresponding ecotoxicological 
      effects. Our systematic assessment of previous microplastic research revealed that 
      most studies have been conducted on single species under laboratory conditions with 
      short-term exposures; few studies were conducted under more realistic long-term 
      field conditions and/or with multi-species assemblages. Studies targeting 
      multi-species assemblages primarily considered soil bacterial communities and showed 
      that microplastics can alter essential nutrient cycling functions. More ecologically 
      meaningful studies of terrestrial microplastics encompassing multi-species 
      assemblages, critical ecological processes (e.g., biogeochemical cycles and 
      pollination) and interactions with other anthropogenic stressors must be conducted. 
      Addressing these knowledge gaps will provide a better understanding of microplastics 
      as emerging global stressors and should lower the risk of ecological surprise in 
      terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Atmospheric transport is an important pathway by which terrestrial microplastics 
      (MPs, with sizes less than 5 mm) can move long distances to remote areas. However, 
      little is known about the environmental behaviors of atmospheric MPs during 
      movement. To address this issue, deposits of MPs on the leaves of plants were 
      studied in two regions, with abundance ranging from 0.07 n/cm(2) (pieces per area of 
      leaves) to 0.19 n/cm(2). The attached substances were mainly natural materials, but 
      28% of the total substances were plastics. There was a similar physical-chemical 
      composition of the attached MPs in the two regions suggesting a similar origin. 
      Leaves, regardless of plant species, can indiscriminately retain atmospheric MPs. 
      About 0.13 trillion pieces of MPs are estimated to be attached to leaf surfaces in 
      the top 11 green countries. Leaves of terrestrial plants could be a temporal sink 
      and a source of MPs pollution to remote areas. This is not fully recognized and 
      merits further study.

      biomaterials under terrestrial gravity and microgravity conditions.
PG  - 74-85
AB  - A novel, h-shaped ultrasonic resonator was used to separate biological particulates. 
      The effectiveness of the resonator was demonstrated using suspensions of the 
      cyanobacterium, Spirulina platensis. The key advantages of this approach were 
      improved acoustic field homogeneity, flow characteristics, and overall separation 
      efficiency (sigma = 1 - ratio of concentration in cleared phase to input), monitored 
      using a turbidity sensor. The novel separation concept was also effective under 
      microgravity conditions; gravitational forces influenced overall efficiency. 
      Separation of Spirulina at cleared flow rates of 14 to 58 L/day, as assessed by 
      remote video recording, was evaluated under both microgravity (</=0.05 g) and 
      terrestrial gravity conditions. The latter involved a comparison with 5- and 
      24-microm-diameter polystyrene microspheres. Influences of gravity on sigma were 
      evaluated by varying the relative inclination angle (within a range of 120 degrees ) 
      between the resonator and the gravitational vector. Cells of Spirulina behaved in a 
      manner comparable to that of the 5-microm-diameter polystyrene microspheres, with a 
      significant decrease in mean (+/-SE, n = 3) sigma from 0.97 +/- 0.03 and 0.91 +/- 
      0.02 at a flow rate of 14 L/day, to corresponding values of 0.53 +/- 0.05 and 0.57 
      +/- 0.03 (P < 0.05) at 58 L/day, respectively. During a typical microgravity period 
      of ca. 22 s, achieved during the 29th ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign, sigma was 
      unchanged at a flow rate of 14 L/day, compared with terrestrial gravity conditions; 
      with increased flow rates, sigma was significantly reduced. Overall, these results 
      demonstrate that, for optimum resonator performance under the relatively short 
      microgravity period utilized in this study, flow rates of ca. 14 L/day were 
      preferred. These data provide a baseline for exploiting noninvasive, compact, 
      ultrasonic separation systems for manipulating biological particulates under 
      microgravity conditions.

AB  - Pollution caused by plastic debris is an urgent environmental problem. Here, we 
      assessed the effects of microplastics in the soil surface litter on the formation 
      and characterization of burrows built by the anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris 
      in soil and quantified the amount of microplastics that was transported and 
      deposited in L. terrestris burrows. Worms were exposed to soil surface litter 
      treatments containing microplastics (Low Density Polyethylene) for 2 weeks at 
      concentrations of 0%, 7%, 28%, 45% and 60%. The latter representing environmentally 
      realistic concentrations found in hot spot soil locations. There were significantly 
      more burrows found when soil was exposed to the surface treatment composed of 7% 
      microplastics than in all other treatments. The highest amount of organic matter in 
      the walls of the burrows was observed after using the treatments containing 28 and 
      45% microplastics. The highest microplastic bioturbation efficiency ratio (total 
      microplastics (mg) in burrow walls/initial total surface litter microplastics (mg)) 
      was found using the concentration of 7% microplastics, where L. terrestris 
      introduced 73.5% of the surface microplastics into the burrow walls. The highest 
      burrow wall microplastic content per unit weight of soil (11.8 ± 4.8 g kg-(1)) was 
      found using a concentration of 60% microplastics. L. terrestris was responsible for 
      size-selective downward transport when exposed to concentrations of 7, 28 and 45% 
      microplastics in the surface litter, as the fraction ≤50 μm microplastics in burrow 
      walls increased by 65% compared to this fraction in the original surface litter 
      plastic. We conclude that the high biogenic incorporation rate of the small-fraction 
      microplastics from surface litter into burrow walls causes a risk of leaching 
      through preferential flow into groundwater bodies. Furthermore, this leaching may 
      have implications for the subsequent availability of microplastics to terrestrial 
      organisms or for the transport of plastic-associated organic contaminants in soil.

TI  - Non-reversible and Reversible Heat Tolerance Plasticity in Tropical Intertidal 
      Animals: Responding to Habitat Temperature Heterogeneity.
PG  - 1909
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2018.01909 [doi]
LID - 1909
AB  - The theory for thermal plasticity of tropical ectotherms has centered on terrestrial 
      and open-water marine animals which experience reduced variation in diurnal and 
      seasonal temperatures, conditions constraining plasticity selection. Tropical marine 
      intertidal animals, however, experience complex habitat thermal heterogeneity, 
      circumstances encouraging thermal plasticity selection. Using the tropical 
      rocky-intertidal gastropod, Echinolittorina malaccana, we investigated heat 
      tolerance plasticity in terms of laboratory acclimation and natural acclimatization 
      of populations from thermally-dissimilar nearby shorelines. Laboratory treatments 
      yielded similar capacities of snails from either population to acclimate their 
      lethal thermal limit (LT(50) variation was ∼2°C). However, the populations differed 
      in the temperature range over which acclimatory adjustments could be made; LT(50) 
      plasticity occurred over a higher temperature range in the warm-shore snails 
      compared to the cool-shore snails, giving an overall acclimation capacity for the 
      populations combined of 2.9°C. In addition to confirming significant heat tolerance 
      plasticity in tropical intertidal animals, these findings reveal two plasticity 
      forms, reversible (laboratory acclimation) and non-reversible (population or 
      shoreline specific) plasticity. The plasticity forms should account for different 
      spatiotemporal scales of the environmental temperature variation; reversible 
      plasticity for daily and tidal variations in microhabitat temperature and 
      non-reversible plasticity for lifelong, shoreline temperature conditions. 
      Non-reversible heat tolerance plasticity, likely established after larvae settle on 
      the shore, should be energetically beneficial in preventing heat shock protein 
      overexpression, but also should facilitate widespread colonization of coasts that 
      support thermally-diverse shorelines. This first demonstration of different 
      plasticity forms in benthic intertidal animals supports the hypothesis that habitat 
      heterogeneity (irrespective of latitude) drives thermal plasticity selection. It 
      further suggests that studies not making reference to different spatial scales of 
      thermal heterogeneity, nor seeking how these may drive different thermal plasticity 
      forms, risk misinterpreting ectothermic responses to environmental warming.

TI  - Associational plant refuges: convergent patterns in marine and terrestrial 
      communities result from differing mechanisms.
PG  - 118-129
LID - 10.1007/BF00380934 [doi]
AB  - An associational plant refuge occurs when a plant that is susceptible to herbivory 
      gains protection from herbivory when it is associated with another plant. In coastal 
      North Carolina, the abundance of the palatable red alga Gracilaria tikvahiae is 
      positively correlated with the abundance of the unpalatable brown alga Sargassum 
      filipendula during times of increased herbivore activity. To see if grazing by the 
      sea urchin Arbacia punctulata could generate this pattern, controlled experiments 
      were conducted in out-door microcosms and in the laboratory. Gracilaria beneath a 
      canopy of Sargassum was eaten significantly less than Gracilaria alone. When Arbacia 
      were excluded, Gracilaria alone grew significantly more than Gracilaria beneath 
      Sargassum, demonstrating that Sargassum is a competitor of Gracilaria. Experiments 
      investigating Sargassum's deterrent role indicated that Sargassum decreased the 
      foraging range of Arbacia and the rate at which it fed on Gracilaria. Additional 
      experiments with plastic Sargassum mimics indicated that the decreased grazing on 
      Gracilaria was not a result of Sargassum morphology, but was probably attributable 
      to some chemical characteristic of Sargassum. The pattern of increased grazing in 
      monocultures (only Gracilaria present) versus polycultures (both Gracilaria and 
      Sargassum present) demonstrated in this study also has been demonstrated for 
      plant-insect interactions in terrestrial communities. In these communities, insect 
      density is higher in monocultures than in polycultures because insects find and 
      immigrate to monocultures more rapidly, and once in a monoculture, they emigrate 
      from them less often than from polycultures. In this study, urchins did not find and 
      immigrate to monocultures more rapidly, nor did they tend to stay in them once they 
      were found; in fact, they emigrated from monocultures of Gracilaria more rapidly 
      than from Gracilaria and Sargassum polycultures. Increased grazing in Gracilaria 
      monocultures resulted from increased rates of movement and feeding of individual 
      herbivores, not from increased herbivore density as has been reported for 
      terrestrial systems.

TI  - Photosynthetic consequences of phenotypic plasticity in response to submergence: 
      Rumex palustris as a case study.
PG  - 283-90
AB  - Survival and growth of terrestrial plants is negatively affected by complete 
      submergence. This is mainly the result of hampered gas exchange between plants and 
      their environment, since gas diffusion is severely reduced in water compared with 
      air, resulting in O2 deficits which limit aerobic respiration. The continuation of 
      photosynthesis could probably alleviate submergence-stress in terrestrial plants, 
      but its potential under water will be limited as the availability of CO2 is 
      hampered. Several submerged terrestrial plant species, however, express plastic 
      responses of the shoot which may reduce gas diffusion resistance and enhance 
      benefits from underwater photosynthesis. In particular, the plasticity of the 
      flooding-tolerant terrestrial species Rumex palustris turned out to be remarkable, 
      making it a model species suitable for the study of these responses. During 
      submergence, the morphology and anatomy of newly developed leaves changed: 'aquatic' 
      leaves were thinner and had thinner cuticles. As a consequence, internal O2 
      concentrations and underwater CO2 assimilation rates were higher at the prevailing 
      low CO2 concentrations in water. Compared with heterophyllous amphibious plant 
      species, underwater photosynthesis rates of terrestrial plants may be very limited, 
      but the effects of underwater photosynthesis on underwater survival are impressive. 
      A combination of recently published data allowed quantification of the magnitude of 
      the acclimation response in this species. Gas diffusion resistance in terrestrial 
      leaves underwater was about 15,000 times higher than in air. Strikingly, acclimation 
      to submergence reduced this factor to 400, indicating that acclimated leaves of R. 
      palustris had an approximately 40 times lower gas diffusion resistance than 
      non-acclimated ones.

TI  - Flexibility is everything: prey capture throughout the seasonal habitat switches in 
      the smooth newt Lissotriton vulgaris.
PG  - 127-142
AB  - Transitions between aquatic and terrestrial habitats are significant steps in 
      vertebrate evolution. Due to the different biophysical demands on the whole organism 
      in water and air, such transitions require major changes of many physiological 
      functions, including feeding. Accordingly, the capability to modulate the 
      pre-programmed chain of prey-capture movements might be essential to maintain 
      performance in a new environment. Newts are of special interest in this regard as 
      they show a multiphasic lifestyle where adults change seasonally between an aquatic 
      and a terrestrial stage. For instance, the Alpine newt is capable of using tongue 
      prehension to feed on land only when in the terrestrial stage, but still manages to 
      suction feed if immersed whilst in terrestrial stage. During the aquatic stage, 
      terrestrial feeding always involved grasping prey by the jaws. Here, we show that 
      this seasonal shift in feeding behavior is also present in a species with a shorter 
      terrestrial stage, the smooth newt Lissotriton vulgaris. Behavioral variability 
      increases when animals change from aquatic to terrestrial strikes in the aquatic 
      stage, but prey-capture movements seem to be generally well-coordinated across the 
      feeding modes. Only suction feeding in the terrestrial stage was seldom performed 
      and appeared uncoordinated. Our results indicate that newts exhibit a high degree of 
      seasonal flexibility of the prey-capture behavior. The similarity between movement 
      patterns of suction feeding and terrestrial feeding suggests that only relatively 
      subtle neuromotoric adjustments to the ancestral, suction-feeding motor program are 
      required to successfully feed in the new environment.

AB  - Recent studies of microplastic have focused on aquatic environment, but its impacts 
      on soil ecosystems were poorly understood, particularly on bacterial communities. In 
      this study, the bacterial taxon and functional composition of soil 
      microplastic-attached communities at Guiyu, a notorious e-waste dismantling area in 
      Guangdong Province, China, were investigated by means of high-throughput sequencing. 
      The results revealed that fundamental difference in bacterial communities existed 
      among microplastics selected from three plots with different dismantling methods and 
      their surroundings, suggesting that microplastic surface created a new ecological 
      niche in soil environment, and the bacteria adapted well to the surface-related 
      lifestyle. The formation of microplastic-attached bacteria depended not only on 
      various dismantled plastic materials, but also on disassembly methods that caused 
      different soil physicochemical characters which might also influence the bacterial 
      communities. As the hydrocarbon degraders, the family Hyphomonadaceae were also 
      found on soil microplastic, further confirming that microorganisms played a role in 
      biodegrading microplastic in e-waste zone. The analysis of functional profiles 
      speculated that microplastic-attached bacteria had the potential to degrade 
      pollutants. This study provides a new perspective for exploring 
      microplastic-associated bacteria and increasing our understanding of microplastic 
      pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Monitoring plastic concentrations in estuaries is vital in assessing the magnitude 
      of terrestrial inputs to oceanic environments. Data on plastics ≤ 5 mm in estuaries 
      are scant. This study determined microplastic levels within five estuaries along the 
      Durban coastline and on intervening beaches. Plastics were isolated from estuarine 
      sediment, beach sediment and the surface water of each estuary and characterised. 
      Sediment at the Bayhead area of Durban harbour had the highest average plastic 
      concentrations (745.4 ± 129.7 particles per 500 ml) and an attenuating concentration 
      trend away from the city centre was found. Prevailing south to north longshore drift 
      was hypothesised to result in plastic accumulation on the northern shores of beaches 
      with estuarine effluents, however, this was not found. Fragments composed the 
      largest percent of plastics (59%) found in Bayhead, whereas fibres dominated other 
      estuaries with proportions ranging from 38% of total plastics in the uMgeni estuary 
      to 66% in the Mdloti.

TI  - Responses of large mammals to climate change.
PG  - 115-27
LID - 10.4161/temp.29651 [doi]
AB  - Most large terrestrial mammals, including the charismatic species so important for 
      ecotourism, do not have the luxury of rapid micro-evolution or sufficient range 
      shifts as strategies for adjusting to climate change. The rate of climate change is 
      too fast for genetic adaptation to occur in mammals with longevities of decades, 
      typical of large mammals, and landscape fragmentation and population by humans too 
      widespread to allow spontaneous range shifts of large mammals, leaving only the 
      expression of latent phenotypic plasticity to counter effects of climate change. The 
      expression of phenotypic plasticity includes anatomical variation within the same 
      species, changes in phenology, and employment of intrinsic physiological and 
      behavioral capacity that can buffer an animal against the effects of climate change. 
      Whether that buffer will be realized is unknown, because little is known about the 
      efficacy of the expression of plasticity, particularly for large mammals. Future 
      research in climate change biology requires measurement of physiological 
      characteristics of many identified free-living individual animals for long periods, 
      probably decades, to allow us to detect whether expression of phenotypic plasticity 
      will be sufficient to cope with climate change.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have adverse effects on aquatic organisms in marine 
      environments; however, there is a lack of information on freshwater environments. 
      This study investigated the dietary uptake, and biodistribution and depuration of 
      MPs in the freshwater diving beetle Cybister japonicus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) 
      after consumption of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to MPs. The transfer of MPs in 
      diving beetles after consumption of zebrafish was assessed to determine whether the 
      presence of MPs affected diving beetle behavior and predation. We found that diving 
      beetles that consumed MP-exposed fish had a significantly lower ingestion rate than 
      the control. In addition, the trophic transfer rate of MPs was 13-18%. However, MPs 
      were found only in the crop and proventriculus of the beetles, and all particles 
      were depurated within 48 h, likely via regurgitation. As diving beetle is a top 
      predator in freshwater ecosystems and could facilitate transfer from aquatic to 
      terrestrial ecosystems via predation, its behavior towards indigestible MPs in its 
      digestive organs (i.e., filtering and vomiting) could represent a meaningful 
      phenomenon as a potential vector for MP transport. This is the first report of the 
      trophic transfer of MPs from fish to dytiscid species, which helps clarify the 
      effects and mechanisms of MPs in freshwater systems.

AB  - Microplastics (1-1000 μm) are ubiquitous in the marine, freshwater and terrestrial 
      environments. These microsized plastics are considered freshwater pollutants of 
      emerging concern, although the impacts on organisms and ecosystems are not yet 
      clear. In particular, effects of microplastics on freshwater aquatic plants and the 
      fate of microplastics in the freshwater trophic chain remain largely unexplored. 
      Here we demonstrate that 10-45 μm polyethylene (PE) microplastics can strongly 
      adsorb to all surfaces of the duckweed species Lemna minor. Despite adsorbance of up 
      to 7 PE microplastics per mm(2), seven day exposure experiments showed that 
      photosynthetic efficiency and plant growth are not affected by microplastics. 
      Rather, dense surface coverage suggests L. minor as a potential vector for the 
      trophic transfer of microplastics. Here we show that the freshwater amphipod 
      Gammarus duebeni can ingest 10-45 μm PE microplastics by feeding on contaminated L. 
      minor. In this study, ingestion of microplastics had no apparent impact on amphipod 
      mortality or mobility after 24 or 48 h exposure. Yet, the feeding study showed that 
      the fate of microplastics in the environment may be complex, involving both plant 
      adsorbance and trophic transfer.

PG  - 4426-34

AB  - Transitions between aquatic and terrestrial environments are significant steps in 
      vertebrate evolution. These transitions require major changes in many biological 
      functions, including food uptake and transport. The Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura 
      alpestris, is known to show a 'multiphasic lifestyle' where the adult shifts from a 
      terrestrial to an aquatic lifestyle and then back to a terrestrial lifestyle every 
      year as a result of its breeding activity. These transitions correspond to dramatic 
      changes in morphology, physiology and behavior, resulting in distinct aquatic and 
      terrestrial morphotypes. We hypothesized that these shifts go along with changes in 
      prey-capture mechanics to maintain a sufficiently high performance in both 
      environments. We analyzed the prey-capture kinematics in the four possible modes: 
      aquatic strikes in the aquatic phase, terrestrial strikes in the terrestrial phase, 
      aquatic strikes in the terrestrial phase and terrestrial strikes in the aquatic 
      phase. A multivariate comparison detected significant kinematic differences between 
      the phase-specific feeding modes. In both the aquatic and the terrestrial phase, I. 
      alpestris uses a suction-feeding mechanism for capturing prey in water. By contrast, 
      I. alpestris uses a jaw-based grasping mechanism with a kinematic profile similar to 
      the aquatic modes for terrestrial prey-capture in its aquatic phase but an elaborate 
      lingual-based prehension mechanism to capture terrestrial prey in the terrestrial 
      phase. These results exhibit a so-far unknown amount of behavioral plasticity in 
      prey-capture behavior that is tuned to the seasonal demands of performance, and 
      exemplify functional mechanisms behind aquatic-terrestrial transitions in 
      vertebrates.

AB  - The organic contamination of Antarctic soils and terrestrial sediments from nearby 
      of five polar scientific stations on King George Island (Antarctica) was 
      investigated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to find 
      composition of dichloromethane extracts of soil and terrestrial sediments. The 
      presence of geochemical markers, such as n-alkanes, steranes, pentacyclic 
      triterpenoids, and alkyl PAHs, their distribution types, and values of their ratios 
      indicates the predominating source of organic fossil fuels and products of their 
      refining rather than from the natural Antarctic environment. Fossil fuel-originated 
      compounds well survived in conditions of Antarctic climate over long times thus 
      enabling to characterize geochemical features of source fossil fuel identified as 
      petroleum expelled from kerogen II of algal/bacterial origins deposited in sub-oxic 
      conditions and being in the middle of catagenesis. Both microbial activity and water 
      leaching play an important role in degradation of terrestrial oil spills in the 
      Antarctica climate, and petroleum alteration occurs lowly over long periods of time. 
      Synthetic anthropogenic compounds found in terrestrial Antarctica sediments included 
      diisopropylnaphthalenes, products of their sulfonates degradation in paper 
      combustion, and organophosporus compounds used as retardants and plasticizers.

TI  - Plasticity of hatching in amphibians: evolution, trade-offs, cues and mechanisms.
PG  - 111-27
LID - 10.1093/icb/icr046 [doi]
AB  - Many species of frogs and salamanders, in at least 12 families, alter their timing 
      of hatching in response to conditions affecting mortality of eggs or larvae. Some 
      terrestrially laid or stranded embryos wait to hatch until they are submerged in 
      water. Some embryos laid above water accelerate hatching if the eggs are 
      dehydrating; others hatch early if flooded. Embryos can hatch early in response to 
      predators and pathogens of eggs or delay hatching in response to predators of 
      larvae; some species do both. The phylogenetic pattern of environmentally cued 
      hatching suggests that similar responses have evolved convergently in multiple 
      amphibian lineages. The use of similar cues, including hypoxia and physical 
      disturbance, in multiple contexts suggests potential shared mechanisms underlying 
      the capacity of embryos to respond to environmental conditions. Shifts in the timing 
      of hatching often have clear benefits, but we know less about the trade-offs that 
      favor plasticity, the mechanisms that enable it, and its evolutionary history. Some 
      potentially important types of cued hatching, such as those involving embryo-parent 
      interactions, are relatively unexplored. I discuss promising directions for research 
      and the opportunities that the hatching of amphibians offers for integrative studies 
      of the mechanisms, ecology and evolution of a critical transition between 
      life-history stages.

AB  - Sea surface concentrations of plastics and their fluxes onto coastlines are 
      simulated over 2009-2015. Calculations incorporate combinations of terrestrial and 
      maritime litter inputs, the Lagrangian model MEDSLIK-II forced by AFS ocean current 
      simulations, and ECMWF wind analyses. With a relatively short particle half-life of 
      43.7 days, the Adriatic Sea is defined as a highly dissipative basin where the 
      shoreline is, by construction, the main sink of floating debris. Our model results 
      show that the coastline of the Po Delta receives a plastic flux of approximately 70 
      kg(km day)(-1). The most polluted sea surface area (>10 g km(-2) floating debris) is 
      represented by an elongated band shifted to the Italian coastline and narrowed from 
      northwest to southeast. Evident seasonality is found in the calculated plastic 
      concentration fields and the coastline fluxes. Complex source-receptor relationships 
      among the basin's subregions are quantified in impact matrices.

TI  - How muscles accommodate movement in different physical environments: aquatic vs. 
      terrestrial locomotion in vertebrates.
PG  - 61-75
AB  - Representatives of nearly all vertebrate classes are capable of coordinated movement 
      through aquatic and terrestrial environments. Though there are good data from a 
      variety of species on basic patterns of muscle recruitment during locomotion in a 
      single environment, we know much less about how vertebrates use the same 
      musculoskeletal structures to accommodate locomotion in physically distinct 
      environments. To address this issue, we have gathered data from a broad range of 
      vertebrates that move successfully through water and across land, including eels, 
      toads, turtles and rats. Using high-speed video in combination with electromyography 
      and sonomicrometry, we have quantified and compared the activity and strain of 
      individual muscles and the movements they generate during aquatic vs. terrestrial 
      locomotion. In each focal species, transitions in environment consistently elicit 
      alterations in motor output by major locomotor muscles, including changes in the 
      intensity and duration of muscle activity and shifts in the timing of activity with 
      respect to muscle length change. In many cases, these alterations likely change the 
      functional roles played by muscles between aquatic and terrestrial locomotion. Thus, 
      a variety of forms of motor plasticity appear to underlie the ability of many 
      species to move successfully through different physical environments and produce 
      diverse behaviors in nature.

AB  - Marine debris is widespread in oceans worldwide, including the most remote 
      locations. Here, for the first time, we report macro-debris accumulation on beaches 
      of Trindade Island, a remote island 1160 km from mainland Brazil. High debris 
      density was recorded on windward, east-coast beaches, which are exposed to 
      wind-driven currents. Small-sized plastic fragments were the most abundant debris. 
      Polyethylene (67%), polypropylene (30%) and polyamide (3%) were the most prevalent 
      polymeric materials identified by ATR-FTIR. Identified debris show that interaction 
      with Trindade fauna, mainly with seabirds and endangered terrestrial crabs, exists 
      and already has some impact. This study provides baseline information on Trindade 
      macro-debris demonstrating that the island, located on the edge of the South 
      Atlantic Gyre, acts as a sink for gyre debris, exposing the island fauna to the 
      threats related to plastic contamination.

TI  - Occurrence of organophosphorus flame retardants and plasticizers in wild insects 
      from a former e-waste recycling site in the Guangdong province, South China.

AB  - Due to the fast growth of the electronic industry, a large quantity of electronic 
      waste (e-waste) is generated worldwide and then often inappropriately dismantled and 
      disposed of. In a pilot study, the occurrence of organophosphorus flame retardants 
      and plasticizers (PFRs) was investigated for the first time in several wild insect 
      species collected from a former e-waste recycling site in the Guangdong province, 
      South China. TEHP was the most abundant PFR (average concentration of 5.8 ng/g ww), 
      followed by TPHP (2.5 ng/g ww), TCIPP (2.2 ng/g ww), TCEP (0.8 ng/g ww), EHDPHP and 
      TCP (both 0.1 ng/g ww). Dragonfly nymphs were the most contaminated insects, with 
      total PFR concentrations of 68 ng/g ww, followed by moth adults (26 ng/g ww) and 
      terrestrial stinkbug (17 ng/g ww). The different contamination patterns observed in 
      the analyzed insects could be explained by their different habitats and feeding 
      habits. This study shows that e-waste recycling areas can be an important local 
      source of contamination with PFRs, mainly caused by inadequate recycling activities.

TI  - Amphibious fish jump better on land after acclimation to a terrestrial environment.
PG  - 3204-3207
AB  - Air and water differ dramatically in density and viscosity, posing different 
      biomechanical challenges for animal locomotion. We asked how terrestrial acclimation 
      influences locomotion in amphibious fish, specifically testing the hypothesis that 
      terrestrial tail flip performance is improved by plastic changes in the skeletal 
      muscle. Mangrove rivulus Kryptolebias marmoratus, which remain largely inactive out 
      of water, were exposed to water or air for 14 days and a subgroup of air-exposed 
      fish was also recovered in water. Tail flip jumping performance on land improved 
      dramatically in air-acclimated fish, they had lower lactate levels compared with 
      control fish, and these effects were mostly reversible. Muscle plasticity 
      significantly increased oxidative muscle cross-sectional area and fibre size, as 
      well as the number of capillaries per fibre. Our results show that reversible 
      changes to the oxidative skeletal muscle of K. marmoratus out of water enhance 
      terrestrial locomotory performance, even in the absence of exercise training.

TI  - Characteristic of microplastics in the atmospheric fallout from Dongguan city, 
      China: preliminary research and first evidence.
PG  - 24928-24935
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-0116-x [doi]
AB  - Microplastic pollution has exhibited a global distribution, including seas, lakes, 
      rivers, and terrestrial environment in recent years. However, little attention was 
      paid on the atmospheric environment, though the fact that plastic debris can escape 
      as wind-blown debris was previously reported. Thus, characteristics of microplastics 
      in the atmospheric fallout from Dongguan city were preliminarily studied. 
      Microplastics of three different polymers, i.e., PE, PP, and PS, were identified. 
      Diverse shapes of microplastics including fiber, foam, fragment, and film were 
      found, and fiber was the dominant shape of the microplastics. SEM images illustrated 
      that adhering particles, grooves, pits, fractures, and flakes were the common 
      patterns of degradation. The concentrations of non-fibrous microplastics and fibers 
      ranged from 175 to 313 particles/m(2)/day in the atmospheric fallout. Thus, dust 
      emission and deposition between atmosphere, land surface, and aquatic environment 
      were associated with the transportation of microplastics.

TI  - Fish embryos on land: terrestrial embryo deposition lowers oxygen uptake without 
      altering growth or survival in the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus.
PG  - 3249-56
LID - 10.1242/jeb.127399 [doi]
AB  - Few teleost fishes incubate embryos out of water, but the oxygen-rich terrestrial 
      environment could provide advantages for early growth and development. We tested the 
      hypothesis that embryonic oxygen uptake is limited in aquatic environments relative 
      to air using the self-fertilizing amphibious mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias 
      marmoratus, which typically inhabits hypoxic, water-filled crab burrows. We found 
      that adult mangrove rivulus released twice as many embryos in terrestrial versus 
      aquatic environments and that air-reared embryos had accelerated developmental 
      rates. Surprisingly, air-reared embryos consumed 44% less oxygen and possessed 
      larger yolk reserves, but attained the same mass, length and chorion thickness. 
      Water-reared embryos moved their opercula ∼2.5 more times per minute compared with 
      air-reared embryos at 7 days post-release, which probably contributed to the higher 
      rates of oxygen uptake and yolk utilization we observed. Genetically identical air- 
      and water-reared embryos from the same parent were raised to maturity, but the 
      embryonic environment did not affect growth, reproduction or emersion ability in 
      adults. Therefore, although aspects of early development were plastic, these early 
      differences were not sustained into adulthood. Kryptolebias marmoratus embryos 
      hatched out of water when exposed to aerial hypoxia. We conclude that exposure to a 
      terrestrial environment reduces the energetic costs of development partly by 
      reducing the necessity of embryonic movements to dispel stagnant boundary layers. 
      Terrestrial incubation of young would be especially beneficial to amphibious fishes 
      that occupy aquatic habitats of poor water quality, assuming low terrestrial 
      predation and desiccation risks.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to change its phenotype in 
      response to changes in the environment. General mathematical descriptions of the 
      phenomenon rely on an abstract measure of "viability" that, in this study, is 
      instantiated in the case of the Tiger Salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum. This organism 
      has a point in its development when, upon maturing, it may take two very different 
      forms. One is a terrestrial salamander (metamorph)that visits ponds to reproduce and 
      eat, while the other is an aquatic form (paedomorph) that remains in the pond to 
      breed and which consumes a variety of prey including its own offspring. A seven 
      dimensional nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations is developed, 
      incorporating small (Z) and large (B) invertebrates, Ambystoma young of the year 
      (Y), juveniles (J), terrestrial metamorphs (A) and aquatic paedomorphs (P). One 
      parameter in the model controls the proportion of juveniles maturing into A versus 
      P. Solutions are shown to remain non-negative. Every effort was made to justify 
      parameters biologically through studies reported in the literature. A sensitivity 
      analysis and equilibrium analysis of model parameters demonstrate that morphological 
      choice is critical to the overall composition of the Ambystoma population. Various 
      population viability measures were used to select optimal percentages of juveniles 
      maturing into metamorphs, with optimal choices differing considerably depending on 
      the viability measure. The model suggests that the criteria for viability for this 
      organism vary, both from location to location and also in time. Thus, optimal 
      responses change with spatiotemporal variation, which is consistent with other 
      phenotypically plastic systems. Two competing hypotheses for the conditions under 
      which metamorphosis occurs are examined in light of the model and data from an 
      Ambystoma tigrinum population at Mexican Cut, Colorado. The model clearly supports 
      one of these over the other for this data set. There appears to be a mathematical 
      basis to the general tenet of spatiotemporal variation being important for the 
      maintenance of polyphenisms, and our results suggest that such variation may have 
      cascading effects on population, community, and perhaps ecosystem dynamics because 
      it drives the production of a keystone, cannibalistic predator.

AB  - Amphibious fishes transition between aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and must 
      therefore learn to navigate two dramatically different environments. We used the 
      amphibious killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus to test the hypothesis that the spatial 
      learning ability of amphibious fishes would be altered by exposure to terrestrial 
      environments because of neural plasticity in the brain region linked to spatial 
      cognition (dorsolateral pallium). We subjected fish to eight weeks of fluctuating 
      air-water conditions or terrestrial exercise before assessing spatial learning using 
      a bifurcating T-maze, and neurogenesis in the dorsolateral pallium by immunostaining 
      for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. In support of our hypothesis, we found that 
      air-water fluctuations and terrestrial exercise improved some markers of spatial 
      learning. Moreover, air-water and exercised fish had 39% and 46% more proliferating 
      cells in their dorsolateral pallium relative to control fish, respectively. Overall, 
      our findings suggest that fish with more terrestrial tendencies may have a cognitive 
      advantage over those that remain in water, which ultimately may influence their 
      fitness in both aquatic and terrestrial settings. More broadly, understanding the 
      factors that promote neural and behavioural plasticity in extant amphibious fishes 
      may provide insights into how ancestral fishes successfully colonized novel 
      terrestrial environments before giving rise to land-dwelling tetrapods.

AB  - Microplastics and agrochemicals are common pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems. 
      Their interaction during coexistence in soils may influence their fate and adverse 
      effects on terrestrial organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate how the 
      exposure to two types of microplastics; polyester fibres, and crumb rubber; induce 
      changes in immune parameters of Porcellio scaber and if the co-exposure of 
      microplastics affects the response induced by the organophosphate pesticide 
      chlorpyrifos. A number of immune parameters, such as total haemocyte count, 
      differential haemocyte count, and phenoloxidase-like activity were assessed. In 
      addition, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the haemolymph was evaluated 
      as a measure of the bioavailability of chlorpyrifos. After three weeks of exposure, 
      the most noticeable changes in the measured immune parameters and also a 
      significantly reduced AChE activity were seen in chlorpyrifos-exposed animals. Both 
      types of microplastic at environmentally relevant concentrations caused only slight 
      changes in immune parameters which were not dependent on the type of microplastic, 
      although the two types differed significantly in terms of the chemical complexity of 
      the additives. Mixtures of chlorpyrifos and microplastics induced changes that 
      differed from individual exposures. For example, alterations in some measured 
      parameters suggested a reduced bioavailability of chlorpyrifos (AChE activity, 
      haemocyte viability) caused by both types of microplastics exposure, but the 
      increase of haemocyte count was promoted by the presence of fibres implying their 
      joint action. In conclusion, this study suggests that immune processes in P. scaber 
      are slightly changed upon exposure to both types of microplastics and microplastics 
      can significantly modulate the effects of other co-exposed chemicals. Further 
      research is needed on the short-term and long-term joint effects of microplastics 
      and agrochemicals on the immunity of soil invertebrates.

TI  - The impact of larval predators and competitors on the morphology and fitness of 
      juvenile treefrogs.
PG  - 596-604
AB  - Studies of phenotypic plasticity typically focus on traits in single ontogenetic 
      stages. However, plastic responses can be induced in multiple ontogenetic stages and 
      traits induced early in ontogeny may have lasting effects. We examined how gray 
      treefrog larvae altered their morphology in four different larval environments and 
      whether different larval environments affected the survival, growth, development, 
      and morphology of juvenile frogs at metamorphosis. We then reared these juveniles in 
      terrestrial environments under high and low intraspecific competition to determine 
      whether the initial differences in traits at metamorphosis affected subsequent 
      survival and growth, whether the initial phenotypic differences converged over time, 
      and whether competition in the terrestrial environment induced further phenotypic 
      changes. Larval and juvenile environments both affected treefrog traits. Larval 
      predators induced relatively deep tail fins and short bodies, but there was no 
      impact on larval development. In contrast, larval competitors induced relatively 
      short tails and long bodies, reduced larval growth, and slowed larval development. 
      At metamorphosis, larval predators had no effect on juvenile growth or relative 
      morphology while larval competitors produced juveniles that were smaller and 
      possessed relatively shorter limbs and shorter bodies. After 1 month of terrestrial 
      competition among the juvenile frogs, the initial differences in juvenile morphology 
      did not converge. There were no differences in growth due to larval treatment but 
      there were differences in survival. Individuals that experienced low competition as 
      tadpoles experienced near perfect survival as juvenile frogs but individuals that 
      experienced high competition as tadpoles suffered an 18% decrease in survival as 
      juvenile frogs. There were also morphological responses to juvenile competition, but 
      these changes appear to be due, at least in part, to allometric effects. 
      Collectively, these results demonstrate that larval environments can have profound 
      impacts on the traits and fitness of organisms later in ontogeny.

AB  - Environmental contamination by plastic particles, also known as 'microplastics', 
      brings synthetic materials that are non-degradable and biologically incompatible 
      into contact with ecosystems. In this paper we present concentration data for this 
      emerging contaminant in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and freshwater and 
      marine systems, reflecting the routes via which these particles can travel and the 
      ecosystems they potentially impact along their path. Raw sewage influents, effluents 
      and sewage sludge from seven municipal WWTPs in the Netherlands contained mean 
      particle concentrations of 68-910L(-1), 51-81L(-1) and 510-760kg(-1) wet weight 
      (ww), respectively (particle sizes between 10 and 5000μm). Even after treatment, 
      wastewater constitutes a source of microplastic pollution of surface waters, and via 
      biosolids applications in farming and forestry, plastic retained in sewage sludge 
      can be transferred to terrestrial environments. The WWTPs investigated here had a 
      mean microplastics retention efficiency of 72% (s.d. 61%) in the sewage sludge. In 
      the receiving waters of treated and untreated wastewaters, we detected high 
      microplastic levels in riverine suspended particulate matter (1400-4900kg(-1) dry 
      weight (dw)) from the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Amsterdam canal water sampled at 
      different urban locations contained microplastic concentrations (48-187L(-1)), 
      similar to those observed in wastewater that is emitted from sewage treatment 
      facilities in the area. At least partial settling of the particles occurs in 
      freshwater as well, as indicated by microplastics in urban canal sediments (<68 to 
      10,500particleskg(-1)dw). Microplastics in suspension in the water column have the 
      potential to be discharged into the sea with other riverine suspended particulates. 
      We report microplastic concentrations from 100 up to 3600particleskg(-1) dry 
      sediment collected at 15 locations along the Dutch North Sea coast. The high 
      microplastic enrichment in marine sediments compared to most literature data for 
      seawater at the surface supports the hypothesis of a seabed sink for these 
      materials. Marine species are heavily exposed to plastic particles. Body residues 
      between 10 and 100particlesg(-1)dw were measured in benthic macroinvertebrate 
      species inhabiting the Dutch North Sea coast: filter-feeding mussels and oysters 
      (species for human consumption) as well as other consumers in the marine food chain.

AB  - Due to their terrestrial habitats and aquatic reproduction, many amphibians are both 
      very vulnerable and highly suitable bioindicators. The plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) 
      is one of the most produced chemical substances worldwide, and knowledge on its 
      impacts on humans and animals is mounting. BPA is used for the industrial production 
      of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins and found in a multitude of consumer 
      products. Studies on BPA have involved mammals, fish and the fully aquatic anuran 
      model Xenopus laevis. However, our knowledge about the sexual development of 
      non-model, often semi-terrestrial anuran amphibians remains poor. Using a recently 
      developed experimental design, we simultaneously applied BPA to two non-model 
      species (Hyla arborea, Hylidae; Bufo viridis, Bufonidae) and the model X. laevis 
      (Pipidae), compared their genetic and phenotypic sex for detection of sex reversals, 
      and studied sexual development, focusing on anatomical and histological features of 
      gonads. We compared three concentrations of BPA (0.023, 2.28 and 228 μg/L) to 
      control groups in a high-standard flow-through-system, and tested whether 
      conclusions, drawn from the model species, can be extrapolated to non-model anurans. 
      In contrast to previous studies on fish and Xenopus, often involving dosages much 
      higher than most environmental pollution data, we show that BPA causes neither the 
      development of mixed sex nor of sex-reversed individuals (few, seemingly 
      BPA-independent sex reversals) in all focal species. However, environmentally 
      relevant concentrations, as low as 0.023 μg/L, were sufficient to provoke 
      species-specific anatomically and histologically detectable impairments of gonads, 
      and affected morphological traits of metamorphs. As the intensity of these effects 
      differed between the three species, our data imply that BPA diversely affects 
      amphibians with different evolutionary history, sex determination systems and larval 
      ecologies. These results highlight the role of amphibians as a sensitive group that 
      is responsive to environmental pollution.

AB  - Transformations and long-term fate of engineered nanomaterials must be measured in 
      realistic complex natural systems to accurately assess the risks that they may pose. 
      Here, we determine the long-term behavior of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-coated silver 
      nanoparticles (AgNPs) in freshwater mesocosms simulating an emergent wetland 
      environment. AgNPs were either applied to the water column or to the terrestrial 
      soils. The distribution of silver among water, solids, and biota, and Ag speciation 
      in soils and sediment was determined 18 months after dosing. Most (70 wt %) of the 
      added Ag resided in the soils and sediments, and largely remained in the compartment 
      in which they were dosed. However, some movement between soil and sediment was 
      observed. Movement of AgNPs from terrestrial soils to sediments was more facile than 
      from sediments to soils, suggesting that erosion and runoff is a potential pathway 
      for AgNPs to enter waterways. The AgNPs in terrestrial soils were transformed to 
      Ag(2)S (~52%), whereas AgNPs in the subaquatic sediment were present as Ag(2)S (55%) 
      and Ag-sulfhydryl compounds (27%). Despite significant sulfidation of the AgNPs, a 
      fraction of the added Ag resided in the terrestrial plant biomass (~3 wt % for the 
      terrestrially dosed mesocosm), and relatively high body burdens of Ag (0.5-3.3 μg 
      Ag/g wet weight) were found in mosquito fish and chironomids in both mesocosms. 
      Thus, Ag from the NPs remained bioavailable even after partial sulfidation and when 
      water column total Ag concentrations are low (<0.002 mg/L).

AB  - In order to determine the relevance of microplastic particles in various 
      environmental media, comprehensive investigations are needed. However, no analytical 
      method exists for fast identification and quantification. At present, optical 
      spectroscopy methods like IR and RAMAN imaging are used. Due to their time consuming 
      procedures and uncertain extrapolation, reliable monitoring is difficult. For 
      analyzing polymers Py-GC-MS is a standard method. However, due to a limited sample 
      amount of about 0.5 mg it is not suited for analysis of complex sample mixtures like 
      environmental samples. Therefore, we developed a new thermoanalytical method as a 
      first step for identifying microplastics in environmental samples. A sample amount 
      of about 20 mg, which assures the homogeneity of the sample, is subjected to 
      complete thermal decomposition. The specific degradation products of the respective 
      polymer are adsorbed on a solid-phase adsorber and subsequently analyzed by thermal 
      desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry. For certain identification, the 
      specific degradation products for the respective polymer were selected first. 
      Afterwards real environmental samples from the aquatic (three different rivers) and 
      the terrestrial (bio gas plant) systems were screened for microplastics. Mainly 
      polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) were identified for the 
      samples from the bio gas plant and PE and PS from the rivers. However, this was only 
      the first step and quantification measurements will follow.

AB  - Microplastics are emerging pollutants that have recently aroused considerable 
      concern but most toxicological studies have focused on marine biota, with little 
      investigation of the influence of microplastics on terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we 
      fed the soil oligochaete Enchytraeus crypticus with oatmeal containing 0, 0.025, 
      0.5, and 10% (dry weight basis) nano-polystyrene (0.05-0.1 μm particle size) to 
      elucidate the impact of microplastics on the growth and gut microbiome of 
      Enchytraeus crypticus. We observed a significant reduction of weight in the animals 
      fed 10% polystyrene and an increase in the reproduction of those fed 0.025%. More 
      importantly, using 16S rRNA amplification and high-throughput sequencing we found a 
      significant shift in the microbiome of those fed 10% microplastics with significant 
      decreases in the relative abundance of the families Rhizobiaceae, Xanthobacteraceae 
      and Isosphaeraceae. These families contain key microbes that contribute to nitrogen 
      cycling and organic matter decomposition.

TI  - Sulfidation of silver nanoparticles: natural antidote to their toxicity.
PG  - 13440-8
LID - 10.1021/es403527n [doi]
AB  - Nanomaterials are highly dynamic in biological and environmental media. A critical 
      need for advancing environmental health and safety research for nanomaterials is to 
      identify physical and chemical transformations that affect the nanomaterial 
      properties and their toxicity. Silver nanoparticles, one of the most toxic and 
      well-studied nanomaterials, readily react with sulfide to form Ag(0)/Ag2S core-shell 
      particles. Here, we show that sulfidation decreased silver nanoparticle toxicity to 
      four diverse types of aquatic and terrestrial eukaryotic organisms (Danio rerio 
      (zebrafish), Fundulus heteroclitus (killifish), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode 
      worm), and the aquatic plant Lemna minuta (least duckweed)). Toxicity reduction, 
      which was dramatic in killifish and duckweed even for low extents of sulfidation 
      (about 2 mol % S), is primarily associated with a decrease in Ag(+) concentration 
      after sulfidation due to the lower solubility of Ag2S relative to elemental Ag 
      (Ag(0)). These results suggest that even partial sulfidation of AgNP will decrease 
      the toxicity of AgNPs relative to their pristine counterparts. We also show that, 
      for a given organism, the presence of chloride in the exposure media strongly 
      affects the toxicity results by affecting Ag speciation. These results highlight the 
      need to consider environmental transformations of NPs in assessing their toxicity to 
      accurately portray their potential environmental risks.

AB  - Microplastic particles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are currently discussed 
      as an emerging persistent organic pollutant and as acting as a vector for 
      hydrophobic chemicals. Microplastic particles may ultimately deposit and accumulate 
      in soil as well as marine and freshwater sediments where they can be harmful to 
      organisms. In this study, we tested the sensitivity of natural freshwater sediment 
      bacterial communities (by genetic fingerprint) to exposure to microplastics 
      (polyethylene, 2 and 20 mg/g sediment) and microplastics loaded with polycyclic 
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, phenanthrene and anthracene), using a laboratory-based 
      approach. After two weeks of incubation, the bacterial community composition from an 
      unpolluted river section was altered by high concentrations of microplastics, 
      whereas the community downstream of a wastewater treatment plant remained unchanged. 
      Low microplastic concentrations loaded with phenanthrene or anthracene induced a 
      less pronounced response in the sediment communities compared to the same total 
      amount of phenanthrene or anthracene alone. In addition, biodegradation of the PAHs 
      was reduced. This study shows, that microplastic can affect bacterial community 
      composition in unpolluted freshwater sediments. Moreover, the results indicate that 
      microplastics can serve as a vehicle for hydrophobic pollutants but bioavailability 
      of the latter is reduced by the sorption to microplastics.

TI  - Evidence for the evolution of thermal tolerance, but not desiccation tolerance, in 
      response to hotter, drier city conditions in a cosmopolitan, terrestrial isopod.
PG  - 12-23
LID - 10.1111/eva.13052 [doi]
AB  - Cities are often hotter and drier compared with nearby undeveloped areas, but how 
      organisms respond to these multifarious stressors associated with urban heat islands 
      is largely unknown. Terrestrial isopods are especially susceptible to temperature 
      and aridity stress as they have retained highly permeable gills from their aquatic 
      ancestors. We performed a two temperature common garden experiment with urban and 
      rural populations of the terrestrial isopod, Oniscus asellus, to uncover evidence 
      for plastic and evolutionary responses to urban heat islands. We focused on 
      physiological tolerance traits including tolerance of heat, cold, and desiccation. 
      We also examined body size responses to urban heat islands, as size can modulate 
      physiological tolerances. We found that different mechanisms underlie responses to 
      urban heat islands. While evidence suggests urban isopods may have evolved higher 
      heat tolerance, urban and rural isopods had statistically indistinguishable cold and 
      desiccation tolerances. In both populations, plasticity to warmer rearing 
      temperature diminished cold tolerance. Although field-collected urban and rural 
      isopods were the same size, rearing temperature positively affected body size. 
      Finally, larger size improved desiccation tolerance, which itself was influenced by 
      rearing temperature. Our study demonstrates how multifarious changes associated with 
      urban heat islands will not necessarily contribute to contemporary evolution in each 
      of the corresponding physiological traits.

TI  - Substrate attributes determine gait in a terrestrial gastropod.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - Some terrestrial gastropods are able to move using two gaits: adhesive crawling, 
      where the entire foot is separated from the substrate only by a thin layer of mucus 
      and the snail leaves a continuous mucus trail; and loping, where regions of the foot 
      arch above the substrate and the snail leaves a discontinuous mucus trail. Loping 
      has been interpreted as a means of rapidly escaping predators. We found that the 
      pulmonate Cornu aspersum moved using adhesive crawling on dry acrylic or glass 
      substrates, but loped on dry concrete or wood. Loping snails did not move more 
      rapidly than snails using adhesive crawling. Snails moving on concrete secreted a 
      greater volume of pedal mucus per area of trail than those moving on acrylic; 
      locomotion on concrete thus requires greater expenditure of mucus than does 
      locomotion on acrylic. Because loping snails deposit a smaller area of mucus per 
      distance traveled than do snails using adhesive crawling, loping may conserve mucus 
      when moving on porous, absorbent substrates. Members of several other terrestrial 
      pulmonate taxa can also lope on concrete, suggesting that this plasticity in gait is 
      widespread among terrestrial snails.

TI  - Light quantity and quality induce shade-avoiding plasticity in a marine macroalga.
PG  - 426-35
AB  - Light-induced plasticity in plant morphology is considered adaptive in terrestrial 
      habitats that vary in light, but remains unexplored for marine habitats. This is 
      despite similar modes of growth, development and photosynthetic equipment in 
      terrestrial and marine photoautotrophs and similarly dynamic light environments. We 
      tested whether manipulations of light quantity and quality induce morphological 
      plasticity in the marine macroalga, Asparagopsis armata. Using multivariate analyses 
      (principal components analyses and multivariate analyses of covariance), we show 
      that correlated morphological traits underlie a fundamental growth strategy 
      characterized by the production of phalanx and guerrilla phenotypes in environments 
      that mimic light and shade respectively. This foraging response is not under simple 
      genetic or environmental control, but influenced by interactions between genotype 
      and environment. Evidence of plasticity and genetic variation in plasticity in a 
      marine modular organism generates additional, testable hypotheses on the ecological 
      consequences of variation in growth form that may further explain the evolution of 
      plasticity.

AB  - Nanomaterials of various shapes and dimensions are widely used in the medical, 
      chemical, and electronic industries. Multiple studies have reported the 
      ecotoxicological effects of nanaoparticles when released in aquatic and terrestrial 
      ecosystems; however, information on the toxicity of silver nanowires (AgNWs) to 
      freshwater organisms and their transfer through the food webs is limited. In the 
      present study, we aimed to evaluate the toxicity of 10- and 20-μm-long AgNWs to the 
      alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the water flea Daphnia magna, and the zebrafish and 
      study their movement through this three-species food chain using a variety of 
      qualitative and quantitative methods as well as optical techniques. We found that 
      AgNWs directly inhibited the growth of algae and destroyed the digestive organs of 
      water fleas. The results showed that longer AgNWs (20μm) were more toxic than 
      shorter ones (10μm) to both algae and water fleas, but shorter AgNWs were 
      accumulated more than longer ones in the body of the fish. Overall, this study 
      suggests that AgNWs are transferred through food chains, and that they affect 
      organisms at higher trophic levels, potentially including humans. Therefore, further 
      studies that take into account environmental factors, food web complexity, and 
      differences between nanomaterials are required to gain better understanding of the 
      impact of nanomaterials on natural communities and human health.

AB  - Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is recognized in vertebrates as an Endocrine 
      Disrupting Chemical (EDC). DEHP can alter steroid hormones production, development, 
      reproduction and behavior in vertebrates. Only few studies investigated DEHP effects 
      on insects. However, some recent studies on aquatic insects showed that DEHP could 
      also act as an EDC by interfering with the signaling pathways of ecdysteroids, the 
      main hormones involved in the control of insect post-embryonic development and 
      physiology. The aim of the study was to investigate (1) the fate of DEHP within a 
      terrestrial insect species by exposing larvae to food containing a wide range of 
      DEHP concentrations and (2) the effects of this chemical on their post-embryonic 
      development and metamorphosis, by using a multi-level approach. DEHP was shown to be 
      present both in larvae and resulting stages, with higher concentrations in 
      chrysalises and adults than in larvae. DEHP concentrations also decreased at the end 
      of the last larval instar, suggesting the metabolic transformation or excretion of 
      this chemical during this time. Only the two highest DEHP doses induced higher 
      insect mortality, whereas low and intermediate concentrations increased larval food 
      consumption without affecting body weight. Metabolic profiles showed that in control 
      insects, the last three days before metamorphosis correspond to a metabolic 
      transition, but with time-dependent changes in treated insects. Interestingly, DEHP 
      treatments also alter both hemolymphatic ecdysteroid titers and expression levels of 
      ecdysteroid response genes. These results confirm that DEHP can alter insect 
      post-embryonic development and metamorphosis, by interfering with ecdysteroid 
      pathways.

TI  - Maintenance of variable responses for coping with wetland drying in freshwater 
      turtles.
PG  - 485-94
AB  - Aquatic animals inhabiting temporary wetlands must respond to habitat drying either 
      by estivating or moving to other wetlands. Using radiotelemetry and capture mark 
      recapture, we examined factors influencing the decisions made by individuals in a 
      population of freshwater turtles (Chelodina longicollis) in response to wetland 
      drying in southeastern Australia. Turtles exhibited both behaviors, either remaining 
      quiescent in terrestrial habitats for variable lengths of time (terrestrial 
      estivation) or moving to other wetlands. Both the proportion of individuals that 
      estivated terrestrially and the time individuals spent in terrestrial habitats 
      increased with decreasing wetland hydroperiod and increasing distance to the nearest 
      permanent wetland, suggesting behavioral decisions are conditional or state 
      dependent (i.e., plastic) and influenced by local and landscape factors. Variation 
      in the strategy or tactic chosen also increased with increasing isolation from other 
      wetlands, suggesting that individuals differentially weigh the costs and benefits of 
      residing terrestrially vs. those of long-distance movement; movement to other 
      wetlands was the near universal strategy chosen when only a short distance must be 
      traveled to permanent wetlands. The quality of temporary wetlands relative to 
      permanent wetlands at our study site varies considerably and unpredictably with 
      annual rainfall and with it the cost-benefit ratio of each strategy or tactic. 
      Residency in or near temporary wetlands is more successful during wet periods due to 
      production benefits, but movement to permanent wetlands is more successful, or least 
      costly, during dry periods due to survival and body condition benefits. This 
      shifting balance may maintain diversity in response of turtles to the spatial and 
      temporal pattern in wetland quality if their response is in part genetically 
      determined.

AB  - The level of contamination by microscopic anthropogenic litter (0.5-5mm) in 
      terrestrial ecosystems is not well understood. After chemical digestion in 10% KOH, 
      microscopic anthropogenic litter from the gastrointestinal tracts of 17 terrestrial 
      birds was identified and categorized under a stereomicroscope based on its physical 
      properties and melting tests. In total, 364 items from 16 birds were identified as 
      microscopic anthropogenic litter, ranging in size from 0.5 to 8.5mm. No relationship 
      between plastic load and body condition was found. Natural fibers, plastic fibers 
      and fragmented plastics represented, respectively, 37.4% (136 items), 54.9% (200 
      items) and 7.7% (28 items) of total litter items. Small sample sizes limited our 
      ability to draw strong conclusions about the metabolism of natural fibers, but the 
      decline in the proportion of natural fibers from the esophagus to stomach to 
      intestine suggested that they may be digestible. Particles smaller than 5mm 
      represented more than 90% of the total number of pollutant items. Particles with 
      colors in the mid-tones and fibrous shapes were overwhelmingly common particles. The 
      results reflect pollution by microscopic anthropogenic litter in the terrestrial 
      ecosystem of the study area. Microscopic natural fibers, which may disperse and 
      adsorb chemical pollutants differently from microplastic and may pose an even 
      greater risk, are in urgent need of further research.

TI  - Testing the beneficial acclimation hypothesis and its alternatives for locomotor 
      performance.
PG  - 630-44
AB  - The beneficial acclimation hypothesis (BAH) is controversial. While physiological 
      work all but assumes that the BAH is true, recent studies have shown that support 
      for the BAH is typically wanting. The latter have been criticized for assessing the 
      benefits of developmental plasticity rather than acclimation. Here we examine the 
      BAH within a strong inference framework for five congeneric species of ameronothroid 
      oribatid mites that occupy marine to terrestrial habitats. We do so by assessing 
      responses of maximum speed, optimum temperature, and performance breadth, measured 
      from -10 degrees C to 35 degrees C, to four treatment temperatures (0 degrees , 5 
      degrees , 10 degrees , and 15 degrees C). We show that the BAH and its alternatives 
      often make similar empirical predictions. Weak beneficial acclimation is 
      characteristic of one of the more marine species. In the other two upper-shore and 
      marine species, evidence exists for deleterious acclimation and the colder-is-better 
      hypothesis. In the two fully terrestrial species, there is no plasticity. Lack of 
      plasticity is beneficial when cue reliability is low or costs of plasticity are 
      high, and the former seems plausible in terrestrial habitats. However, weak 
      plasticity in the upper-shore/marine species and the absence of plasticity in the 
      terrestrial species might also be a consequence of phylogenetic constraint.

TI  - Ant cuticular response to phthalate pollution.
PG  - 13446-51
LID - 10.1007/s11356-014-3272-2 [doi]
AB  - Phthalates are common atmospheric contaminants used in the plastic industry. Ants 
      have been shown to constitute good bioindicators of phthalate pollution. Hence, 
      phthalates remain trapped on ant cuticles which are mostly coated with long-chain 
      hydrocarbons. In this study, we artificially contaminated Lasius niger ants with 
      four phthalates: dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), 
      di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP). The first three 
      have previously been found on ants in nature in Touraine (France), while the fourth 
      has not. The four phthalates disappeared rapidly (less than 5 days) from the 
      cuticles of live ants. In contrast, on the cuticles of dead ants, DEHP quantities 
      remained unchanged over time. These results indicate that phthalates are actively 
      absorbed by the cuticles of live ants. Cuticular absorption of phthalates is 
      nonspecific because eicosane, a nonnatural hydrocarbon on L. niger cuticle, was 
      similarly absorbed. Ants are important ecological engineers and may serve as 
      bioindicators of ecosystem health. We also suggest that ants and more generally 
      terrestrial arthropods may contribute to the removal of phthalates from the local 
      environment.

AB  - Accumulation of plastic litter exerts pressure on the environment. Microplastics 
      (MPs) pollution has become a universal challenge due to the overexploitation of 
      plastic products and unsystematic dumping of plastic waste. Initial studies on MPs 
      and their implications had been confined to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, but 
      recent research has also focused on MPs in the air. Their impacts on urban air 
      quality and atmospheric transport to pristine habitats have emerged to be a serious 
      concern. However, the extent and the significance of impacts of airborne particulate 
      matter (PM) MPs on human health are not clearly understood. Further, the influence 
      of airborne MPs on indoor and outdoor air quality remains unknown. We highlight the 
      human health impacts of airborne PM-MPs with a special focus on the occupational 
      safety of the industry workers, their possible influence on Air Quality Index (AQI), 
      their potential exposure, and accumulation in the canopy/arboreal, above-canopy and 
      atmospheric (aerial) habitats. The present review emphasizes the data limitations 
      and knowledge gaps on the atmospheric transport and contribution of particulate 
      plastics to the worsening of overall urban air quality and throws critical 
      perspectives on whether atmospheric MPs pollution is trivial or an actual matter of 
      concern.

AB  - Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and social issues of the 
      21st century. Recent work has highlighted the atmosphere's role in transporting 
      microplastics to remote locations [S. Allen et al., Nat. Geosci. 12, 339 (2019) and 
      J. Brahney, M. Hallerud, E. Heim, M. Hahnenberger, S. Sukumaran, Science 368, 
      1257-1260 (2020)]. Here, we use in situ observations of microplastic deposition 
      combined with an atmospheric transport model and optimal estimation techniques to 
      test hypotheses of the most likely sources of atmospheric plastic. Results suggest 
      that atmospheric microplastics in the western United States are primarily derived 
      from secondary re-emission sources including roads (84%), the ocean (11%), and 
      agricultural soil dust (5%). Using our best estimate of plastic sources and modeled 
      transport pathways, most continents were net importers of plastics from the marine 
      environment, underscoring the cumulative role of legacy pollution in the atmospheric 
      burden of plastic. This effort uses high-resolution spatial and temporal deposition 
      data along with several hypothesized emission sources to constrain atmospheric 
      plastic. Akin to global biogeochemical cycles, plastics now spiral around the globe 
      with distinct atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, and terrestrial residence times. 
      Though advancements have been made in the manufacture of biodegradable polymers, our 
      data suggest that extant nonbiodegradable polymers will continue to cycle through 
      the earth's systems. Due to limited observations and understanding of the source 
      processes, there remain large uncertainties in the transport, deposition, and source 
      attribution of microplastics. Thus, we prioritize future research directions for 
      understanding the plastic cycle.

AB  - Environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity may be a critical component of 
      response to changing environments. We examined local differentiation and adaptive 
      phenotypic plasticity in response to elevated temperature in half-sib lines 
      collected across an elevation gradient for the alpine herb, Wahlenbergia ceracea. 
      Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), we found low but significant 
      genetic differentiation between low- and high-elevation seedlings, and seedlings 
      originating from low elevations grew faster and showed stronger temperature 
      responses (more plasticity) than those from medium and high elevations. Furthermore, 
      plasticity was more often adaptive for plants of low-elevation origin and 
      maladaptive for plants of high elevation. With methylation sensitive-AFLP (MS-AFLP), 
      we revealed an increase in epigenetic variation in response to temperature in 
      low-elevation seedlings. Although we did not find significant direct correlations 
      between MS-AFLP loci and phenotypes, our results demonstrate that adaptive 
      plasticity in temperature response to warming varies over fine spatial scales and 
      suggest the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this response.

AB  - Plastics are now found in all natural environments including soil. The effects of 
      microplastics in terrestrial systems, however, remain largely unexplored. 
      Polyethylene is one of the mass-manufactured polymers found in terrestrial 
      environments. It is used in many different sectors, for example in agricultural 
      mulches, composite materials, and packaging. The presence of microplastics in soil, 
      including polyethylene, can affect the transport of hydrophobic organic pollutants 
      including pesticides. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence 
      of polyethylene microplastics (<250 μm) on the transport of two selected organic 
      plant-protection agents (atrazine and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid) in soil 
      under different aqueous conditions, using inverse liquid chromatography. The 
      distribution coefficients for the sorbates that were sorbed to pure polyethylene 
      microplastic were found to be significantly smaller than those for the sorbates 
      sorbed to pure soil. The addition of 10% (w/w) polyethylene to the soil therefore 
      led to an overall reduction in sorption, but the sorption trends due to variations 
      in pH and ionic strength were not affected. The results imply that the presence of 
      polyethylene microplastics in soil may therefore increase the mobility of organic 
      contaminants by reducing the sorption capacity of natural soils, which must be 
      validated by further research.

      Underpinning the Plastic Phenotypes of Alternanthera Philoxeroides in Contrasting

AB  - Alternanthera philoxeroides is an amphibious invasive weed that can colonize both 
      aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Individuals growing in different habitats exhibit 
      extensive phenotypic variation but little genetic differentiation. Little is known 
      about the molecular basis underlying environment-induced phenotypic changes. 
      Variation in transcript abundance in A. philoxeroides was characterized throughout 
      the time-courses of pond and upland treatments using RNA-Sequencing. Seven thousand 
      eight hundred and five genes demonstrated variable expression in response to 
      different treatments, forming 11 transcriptionally coordinated gene groups. 
      Functional enrichment analysis of plastically expressed genes revealed pathway 
      changes in hormone-mediated signaling, osmotic adjustment, cell wall remodeling, and 
      programmed cell death, providing a mechanistic understanding of the biological 
      processes underlying the phenotypic changes in A. philoxeroides. Both 
      transcriptional modulation of environmentally sensitive loci and environmentally 
      dependent control of regulatory loci influenced the plastic responses to the 
      environment. Phenotypic responses and gene expression patterns to contrasting 
      hydrological conditions were compared between A. philoxeroides and its alien 
      congener Alternanthera pungens. The terricolous A. pungens displayed limited 
      phenotypic plasticity to different treatments. It was postulated based on gene 
      expression comparison that the interspecific variation in plasticity between A. 
      philoxeroides and A. pungens was not due to environmentally-mediated changes in 
      hormone levels but to variations in the type and relative abundance of different 
      signal transducers and receptors expressed in the target tissue.

LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147166 [doi]
AB  - The amount of plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems is not well known, not 
      only because it is difficult to extract and identify plastic particles from 
      terrestrial samples, but also because it is challenging to take representative 
      samples from soils or sediments. Here, we numerically simulated how to take 
      representative terrestrial samples to quantify plastic particles, and we evaluated 
      the accuracy (error) of reported plastic concentrations in the literature. Fields 
      with randomly distributed plastic particles (uniform and clustered) were numerically 
      generated and sampled to determine the representative elementary volume (REV) and 
      the required number of samples to quantify plastic concentrations (10 to 10(6) 
      particles/m(2)) with different relative errors (5%, 10%, 15%). The REV and the 
      required number of samples decrease hyperbolically as the plastic concentration 
      increases, indicating a strong non-linear relation. For instance, hundreds to 
      thousands of soil cores (8-cm diameter) would be required to quantify plastics at 
      low concentrations (10(2) particles/m(2)), while a few cores are sufficient at high 
      plastic concentrations (10(5) particles/m(2)). For an accurate measurement of 
      plastic concentrations, the total surface area of samples taken should approach or 
      exceed the REV. We recommend to take replicated samples with each sample as large as 
      possible (e.g., 1 m × 1 m) rather than multiple small cores, and then reduce the 
      soil volume by the quartering method.

AB  - In just over half a century plastic products have revolutionized human society and 
      have infiltrated terrestrial and marine environments in every corner of the globe. 
      The hazard plastic debris poses to biodiversity is well established, but mitigation 
      and planning are often hampered by a lack of quantitative data on accumulation 
      patterns. Here we document the amount of debris and rate of accumulation on 
      Henderson Island, a remote, uninhabited island in the South Pacific. The density of 
      debris was the highest reported anywhere in the world, up to 671.6 items/m(2) (mean 
      ± SD: 239.4 ± 347.3 items/m(2)) on the surface of the beaches. Approximately 68% of 
      debris (up to 4,496.9 pieces/m(2)) on the beach was buried <10 cm in the sediment. 
      An estimated 37.7 million debris items weighing a total of 17.6 tons are currently 
      present on Henderson, with up to 26.8 new items/m accumulating daily. Rarely visited 
      by humans, Henderson Island and other remote islands may be sinks for some of the 
      world's increasing volume of waste.

AB  - Although the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in various environments is 
      increasingly well studied, knowledge of the effects of microplastics on ambient 
      microbial communities is still insufficient. To estimate the response of soil 
      bacterial community succession and temporal turnover to microplastic amendment, a 
      soil microcosm experiment was carried out with polyethylene microplastics. The soil 
      samples under control and microplastic amendment conditions were collected for 
      sequencing analysis using Illumina MiSeq technology. Microplastic amendment was 
      found to significantly alter soil bacterial community structure, and the community 
      differences were increased linearly with the incubation time. Compared with the 
      turnover rate of bacterial community in the control samples (0.0103, p < .05, based 
      on Bray-Curtis similarity), the succession rate was significantly (p < .001) higher 
      in the soil with microplastic amendment (0.0309, p < .001). In addition, the effects 
      of microplastic amendment on the time-decay relationships (TDRs) on taxonomic 
      divisions revealed considerable variations of TDRs values, indicating the effects 
      were lineage dependent. Our results propose that the presence of microbial in soil 
      ecosystem may lead to a faster succession rate of soil bacterial community, which 
      provides new insights into the evolutionary consequences of microplastics in 
      terrestrial environment.

TI  - Comparison and analysis of different approaches for estimating the human exposure to 
      phthalate esters.
PG  - 283-91
AB  - The human exposure estimates for dibutyl (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
      (DEHP) made by two models EUSES and ACC-Human, and by an estimation approach which 
      utilized measured concentrations in exposure media, were compared. The approach 
      which utilized the latest monitoring data for important exposure media, yielded 
      median daily intakes for adult humans for DBP and DEHP of 2.7 and 5.6 microg/kg body 
      weight per day, respectively, which were in the same range as previous estimates 
      based on back-calculation from urinary metabolites. EUSES estimated average daily 
      intakes of DBP and DEHP for humans that were between 8 and 13 times lower. ACC-Human 
      does not estimate average daily intakes, but ACC-Human-estimated human milk 
      concentrations/fugacities were more than a thousand times lower than measured 
      concentrations/fugacities in human milk. It was concluded that the two models 
      underestimate human exposure to phthalate esters because they consider only a few 
      key pathways that are known to be important for other, more persistent, hydrophobic 
      organic compounds. Further, it was shown that there are differences between the two 
      models on the methodology for estimating concentrations in exposure media such as 
      vegetation, milk, beef and fish. ACC-Human uses a mechanistic approach for 
      estimating transfer through aquatic and terrestrial food chains that are known to be 
      important for human exposure to persistent, hydrophobic organics and can, unlike 
      EUSES, account for food chain metabolism. It proved difficult, however, to obtain 
      organism metabolism rates needed as model inputs to ACC-Human. If exposure estimates 
      of phthalate esters are needed, it is recommended to use an estimation approach 
      based on high quality monitoring data as presented here and/or back-calculate daily 
      intake from concentrations of metabolites in human urine samples from the general 
      population.

TI  - Diversity and plasticity of C(4) photosynthesis in Eleocharis (Cyperaceae).
PG  - 571-580
LID - 10.1071/FP06296 [doi]
AB  - Eleocharis contains many amphibious species, and displays diversity of 
      photosynthetic mechanism (C(3,) C(4) or C(3)-C(4) intermediates). A unique feature 
      of Eleocharis is the plasticity in the photosynthetic mechanism of some species in 
      response to the environment. In this study, we have examined the culm anatomy and 
      photosynthetic property of several Eleocharis species grown terrestrially and the 
      changes in the newly produced culms over a short period time frame after switching 
      from terrestrial to submerged condition. Eleocharis baldwinii (Torrey) Chapman is 
      C(4)-like in terrestrial habitat, exhibiting O(2) inhibition of photosynthesis with 
      Rubisco expressed in both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells and PEPC strictly in the 
      mesophyll cells, but switches to C(3)-C(4) intermediacy when submerged. In addition 
      to Eleocharis vivipara Link type 1 (which switches from C(4)-like to C(3)), two 
      other photosynthetic types examined in this study were shown to have different 
      responses to growth in either terrestrial or submerged conditions. E. vivipara type 
      2 is a typical C(4) plant in the terrestrial habitat, but becomes a C(3)-C(4) 
      intermediate under submerged conditions. Further, terrestrially, E. vivipara type 3 
      is a C(3)-C(4) intermediate, but when submerged the δ(13)C value increases to -6.7‰, 
      indicating its use of bicarbonate as a major carbon source. The submerged form of 
      this plant exhibited about three times higher photosynthetic O(2) evolution rate, 
      compared to the C(3) species Eleocharis erythropoda Steudel. These Eleocharis 
      species possess different molecular switches for regulating C(4) gene expression in 
      response to environmental stimuli both between different species, and in E. vivipara 
      among different populations. The apparent expression of a bicarbonate transport 
      system by E. vivipara type 3 while submerged represents a unique adaptation to low 
      CO(2) availability.

TI  - The Martian and extraterrestrial UV radiation environment. Part II: further 
      considerations on materials and design criteria for artificial ecosystems.
PG  - 631-40
AB  - Ultraviolet radiation is an important natural physical influence on organism 
      function and ecosystem interactions. The UV radiation fluxes in extraterrestrial 
      environments are substantially different from those experienced on Earth. On Mars, 
      the moon and in Earth orbit they are more biologically detrimental than on Earth. 
      Based on previously presented fluxes and biologically weighted irradiances, this 
      paper considers in more detail measures to mitigate UV radiation damage and methods 
      to modify extraterrestrial UV radiation environments in artificial ecosystems that 
      use natural sunlight. The transmission characteristics of a Martian material that 
      will mimic the terrestrial UV radiation environment are presented. Transmissivity 
      characteristics of other Martian and lunar materials are described. Manufacturing 
      processes for the production of plastics and glass on the lunar and Martian surface 
      are presented with special emphasis on photobiological requirements. Novel UV 
      absorbing configurations are suggested.

TI  - Thermal plasticity of skeletal muscle phenotype in ectothermic vertebrates and its 
      significance for locomotory behaviour.
PG  - 2305-22
AB  - Seasonal cooling can modify the thermal preferenda of ectothermic vertebrates and 
      elicit a variety of physiological responses ranging from winter dormancy to an 
      acclimation response that partially compensates for the effects of low temperature 
      on activity. Partial compensation of activity levels is particularly common in 
      aquatic species for which seasonal temperature changes provide a stable cue for 
      initiating the response. Thermal plasticity of locomotory performance has evolved 
      independently on numerous occasions, and there is considerable phylogenetic 
      diversity with respect to the mechanisms at the physiological and molecular levels. 
      In teleosts, neuromuscular variables that can be modified include the duration of 
      motor nerve stimulation, muscle activation and relaxation times, maximum force and 
      unloaded shortening velocity (V(max)), although not all are modified in every 
      species. Thermal plasticity in V(max) has been associated with changes in myosin 
      ATPase activity and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) composition and/or with a change in 
      the ratio of myosin light chain isoforms. In common carp (Cyprinus carpio), there 
      are continuous changes in phenotype with acclimation temperature at lower levels of 
      organisation, such as MyHC composition and V(max), but a distinct threshold for an 
      effect in terms of locomotory performance. Thus, there is no simple relationship 
      between whole-animal performance and muscle phenotype. The nature and magnitude of 
      temperature acclimation responses also vary during ontogeny. For example, common 
      carp acquire the ability to modify MyHC composition with changes in acclimation 
      temperature during the juvenile stage. In contrast, the thermal plasticity of 
      swimming performance observed in tadpoles of the frog Limnodynastes peronii is lost 
      in the terrestrial adult stage. Although it is often assumed that the adjustments in 
      locomotory performance associated with temperature acclimation enhance fitness, this 
      has rarely been tested experimentally. Truly integrative studies of temperature 
      acclimation are scarce, and few studies have considered both sensory and motor 
      function in evaluating behavioural responses. Developmental plasticity is a special 
      case of a temperature acclimation response that can lead to temporary or permanent 
      changes in morphology and/or physiological characteristics that affect locomotory 
      performance.

TI  - Musculoskeletal architecture of the prey capture apparatus in salamandrid newts with 
      multiphasic lifestyle: does anatomy change during the seasonal habitat switches?
PG  - 757-70
LID - 10.1111/joa.12445 [doi]
AB  - Some newt species change seasonally between an aquatic and a terrestrial life as 
      adults, and are therefore repeatedly faced with different physical circumstances 
      that affect a wide range of functions of the organism. For example, it has been 
      observed that seasonally habitat-changing newts display notable changes in skin 
      texture and tail fin anatomy, allowing one to distinguish an aquatic and a 
      terrestrial morphotype. One of the main functional challenges is the switch between 
      efficient aquatic and terrestrial prey capture modes. Recent studies have shown that 
      newts adapt quickly by showing a high degree of behavioral flexibility, using 
      suction feeding in their aquatic stage and tongue prehension in their terrestrial 
      stage. As suction feeding and tongue prehension place different functional demands 
      on the prey capture apparatus, this behavioral flexibility may clearly benefit from 
      an associated morphological plasticity. In this study, we provide a detailed 
      morphological analysis of the musculoskeletal system of the prey capture apparatus 
      in the two multiphasic newt species Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris 
      by using histological sections and micro-computed tomography. We then test for 
      quantitative changes of the hyobranchial musculoskeletal system between aquatic and 
      terrestrial morphotypes, The descriptive morphology of the cranio-cervical 
      musculoskeletal system provides new insights on form and function of the prey 
      capture apparatus in newts, and the quantitative approach shows hypertrophy of the 
      hyolingual musculoskeletal system in the terrestrial morphotype of L. vulgaris but 
      hypertrophy in the aquatic morphotype of I. alpestris. It was therefore concluded 
      that the seasonal habitat shifts are accompanied by a species-dependent muscular 
      plasticity of which the potential effect on multiphasic feeding performance in newts 
      remains unclear.

TI  - Environmental Impacts by Fragments Released from Nanoenabled Products: A Multiassay, 
      Multimaterial Exploration by the SUN Approach.
PG  - 1514-1524
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.7b04122 [doi]
AB  - Nanoenabled products (NEPs) have numerous outdoor uses in construction, 
      transportation or consumer scenarios, and there is evidence that their fragments are 
      released in the environment at low rates. We hypothesized that the lower surface 
      availability of NEPs fragment reduced their environmental effects with respect to 
      pristine nanomaterials. This hypothesis was explored by testing fragments generated 
      by intentional micronisation ("the SUN approach"; Nowack et al. Meeting the Needs 
      for Released Nanomaterials Required for Further Testing: The SUN Approach. 
      Environmental Science & Technology, 2016 (50), 2747). The NEPs were composed of four 
      matrices (epoxy, polyolefin, polyoxymethylene, and cement) with up to 5% content of 
      three nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, iron oxide, and organic pigment). Regardless 
      of the type of nanomaterial or matrix used, it was observed that nanomaterials were 
      only partially exposed at the NEP fragment surface, indicating that mostly the 
      intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the matrix drove the NEP fragment toxicity. 
      Ecotoxicity in multiple assays was done covering relevant media from terrestrial to 
      aquatic, including sewage treatment plant (biological activity), soil worms 
      (Enchytraeus crypticus), and fish (zebrafish embryo and larvae and trout cell 
      lines). We designed the studies to explore the possible modulation of ecotoxicity by 
      nanomaterial additives in plastics/polymer/cement, finding none. The results support 
      NEPs grouping by the matrix material regarding ecotoxicological effect during the 
      use phase. Furthermore, control results on nanomaterial-free polymer fragments 
      representing microplastic had no significant adverse effects up to the highest 
      concentration tested.

TI  - Impact of ecological doses of the most widespread phthalate on a terrestrial 
      species, the ant Lasius niger.
PG  - 104-10
LID - S0013-9351(14)00062-0 [pii]

AB  - Phthalates are synthetic contaminants released into the environment notably by 
      plastic waste. Semi-volatile, they adsorb to atmospheric particles and get 
      distributed in all ecosystems. Effects of this major anthropogenic pollution in 
      economical species in aquatic habitats have attracted large interest. On the 
      contrary, very few studies have focused on wild terrestrial species. Yet, these 
      lipophilic molecules are easily trapped by insect cuticle; ants and other insects 
      have been shown to permanently bear among their cuticular components a 
      non-negligible proportion of phthalates, meaning that they suffer from chronic 
      exposure to these pollutants. Oral route could also be an additional way of 
      contamination, as phthalates tend to stick to any organic particle. We show here via 
      a food choice experiment that Lasius niger workers can detect, and avoid feeding on, 
      food contaminated with DEHP (DiEthyl Hexyl Phthalate), the most widespread phthalate 
      found in nature. This suggests that the main source of contamination for ants is 
      atmosphere and that doses measured on the cuticle correspond to the chronic exposure 
      levels for these animals. Such an ecologically relevant dose of DEHP was used to 
      contaminate ants in lab and to investigate their physiological impact. Over a 
      chronic exposure (1 dose per week for 5 weeks), the egg-laying rate of queens was 
      significantly reduced lending credence to endocrine disruptive properties of such a 
      pollutant, as also described for aquatic invertebrates. On the contrary, short term 
      exposure (24h) to a single dose of DEHP does not induce oxidative stress in ant 
      workers as expected, but leads to activation of the immune system. Because of their 
      very large distribution, their presence in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and 
      their representation at all trophic levels, ants could be useful indicators of 
      contamination by phthalates, especially via monitoring the level of activation of 
      their immune state.

TI  - Dehydration in dormant insects.
PG  - 837-852
AB  - Many of the mechanisms used by active insects to maintain water balance are not 
      available to dormant individuals. Physiological and biochemical mechanisms of 
      dehydration tolerance and resistance in dormant insects and some other invertebrates 
      are reviewed, as well as linkages of dehydration with energy use and metabolism, 
      with cold hardiness, and with diapause. Many dormant insects combine several 
      striking adaptations to maintain water balance that-in addition to habitat 
      choice-may include especially reduction of body water content, decreased cuticular 
      permeability, absorption of water vapour, and tolerance of low body water levels. 
      Many such features require energy and hence that metabolism, albeit much reduced, 
      continues during dormancy. Four types of progressively dehydrated states are 
      recognized: water is managed internally by solute or ion transport; relatively high 
      concentrations of solutes modify the behaviour of water in solutions; still higher 
      concentrations of certain carbohydrates lead to plasticized rubbers or glasses with 
      very slow molecular kinetics; and anhydrobiosis eliminates metabolism.

TI  - Quantifying shedding of synthetic fibers from textiles; a source of microplastics 
      released into the environment.
PG  - 1191-1199
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-0528-7 [doi]
AB  - Microplastics in the environment are a subject of intense research as they pose a 
      potential threat to marine organisms. Plastic fibers from textiles have been 
      indicated as a major source of this type of contaminant, entering the oceans via 
      wastewater and diverse non-point sources. Their presence is also documented in 
      terrestrial samples. In this study, the amount of microfibers shedding from 
      synthetic textiles was measured for three materials (acrylic, nylon, polyester), 
      knit using different gauges and techniques. All textiles were found to shed, but 
      polyester fleece fabrics shed the greatest amounts, averaging 7360 
      fibers/m(-2)/L(-1) in one wash, compared with polyester fabrics which shed 87 
      fibers/m(-2)/L(-1). We found that loose textile constructions shed more, as did worn 
      fabrics, and high twist yarns are to be preferred for shed reduction. Since fiber 
      from clothing is a potentially important source of microplastics, we suggest that 
      smarter textile construction, prewashing and vacuum exhaustion at production sites, 
      and use of more efficient filters in household washing machines could help mitigate 
      this problem.

      including n-alkanes (n-C14-n-C40), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
      phthalate esters (PAEs) and hopanes were quantified in fine particulate (PM2.5), 
      which were collected in urban area of Guangzhou, China in winter and summer in 
      2012/2013. The pollutants levels were well comparable with the data obtained in 
      previous studies in Pearl River Delta (PRD) region but much lower than most northern 
      Chinese megacities. The contribution of EC to PM2.5 and OC/EC ratio suggest that the 
      pollution sources were relatively consistent in GZ between the two seasons. 
      Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was the most abundant PAHs, which were 4.9 and 1.0ng/m(3) on 
      average, accounting for 10.7% and 9.1% to the total quantified PAHs in winter and 
      summer, respectively. The total concentrations of PAEs ranged from 289.1 to 
      2435ng/m(3) and from 102.4 to 1437ng/m(3), respectively, in winter and summer. 
      Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) was the most dominant PAEs. The ambient levels of PAEs 
      could be partly attributed to the widespread uses of the household products, 
      municipal garbage compressing, sewage, and external painting material on the 
      building. Source apportionment for OC with chemical mass balance (CMB) model 
      demonstrated coal combustion, vehicle emission, cooking, and secondary organic 
      compounds (SOC) formation were the four major pollution sources. Both of the indices 
      of n-alkanes and diagnostic PAHs ratios support that anthropogenic sources such as 
      vehicle emission and coal combustion were the significant pollution sources with 
      some extents from epicuticular waxes by terrestrial plants. The ratio of hopanes to 
      EC proved the influences from vehicle emission, and displayed a certain degree of 
      the air aging in the Guangzhou ambient air.

AB  - The global demand for polystyrene is supposed to reach an overall baseline of 23.5 
      million tons by 2020. The market has experienced the effects of such growth, 
      especially regarding the environmental performance of the production processes. In 
      Brazil, renewable assets have been used to overcome the adverse consequences of this 
      expansion. This study evaluates this issue for the production of Brazilian 
      polystyrene resins, general-purpose polystyrene (GPPS) and high-impact polystyrene 
      (HIPS). The effects of replacing fossil ethylene with a biobased alternative are 
      also investigated. Life Cycle Assessment is applied for ten scenarios, with 
      different technological approaches for renewable ethylene production and an 
      alternative for obtaining bioethanol, which considers the export of electricity. The 
      fossil GPPS and HIPS show a better performance than the partially renewable sources 
      in terms of Climate Change (CC), Terrestrial Acidification (TA), Photochemical 
      Oxidant Formation (POF), and Water Depletion (WD). The exception is Fossil Depletion 
      (FD), a somewhat predictable result. The main environmental loads associated with 
      the renewable options are related to the sugarcane production. Polybutadiene fails 
      to provide greater additional impact to HIPS when compared to GPPS. With regard to 
      obtaining ethylene from ethanol, Adiabatic Dehydration (AD) technology consumes less 
      sugarcane than Adiabatic Dehydration at High Pressure (ADHP), which leads to gains 
      in TA and POF. In contrast, ADHP was more eco-friendly for WD because of its lower 
      water losses and in terms of CC because of the advantageous balance of fossil 
      CO2(eq) at the agricultural stage and the lower consumption of natural gas in 
      ethylene production. The electricity export is an auspicious environmental 
      opportunity because it can counterbalance some of the negative impacts associated 
      with the renewable route. According to a "cradle-to-grave" perspective, the 
      partially renewable resins show a more favorable balance of carbon. This difference 
      increases when sequestration and biogenic carbon emissions are considered.

TI  - Microplastic pollution in African countries' water systems: a review on findings, 
      applied methods, characteristics, impacts, and managements.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Owed to their simplicity, flexibility, lightweight, and low cost, plastics 
      have become highly demanded in Africa as well as worldwide. However, the management 
      of plastic wastes, particularly in African countries, is inadequate and most of the 
      plastic debris is gatewayed into the water bodies. Nowadays, environmentalists, 
      organizations, and governments are aware of microplastic pollution in the marine and 
      terrestrial environment. Thus, addressing a compressive literature review in one 
      referenced paper, as they draw up the articles, is essential to propose new research 
      directions, to synthesize the existing theories among the existing studies. The 
      abundance of microplastics is variable depending on the sampling and identification 
      techniques. In this review, the available publications on microplastic pollution in 
      African countries' water systems were retrieved. Investigations found that 
      microplastic pollution levels in the studied water bodies were reported in high 
      concentrations. It was observed that different sampling and analytical methods were 
      applied for the detection of microplastics, and suggestions were raised at it may 
      affect the reliability of the results. Most of the detected and quantified 
      microplastics were confirmed as they are from secondary sources. Most of the 
      microplastic pollution research was conducted dominantly in South Africa, and 
      secondly Nigeria, although other countries should also start conducting in their 
      water systems. Surface water and sediment samples were dominantly carried out, but 
      are limited with biota samples; hence, the risk assessment of microplastics is not 
      yet determined. Some of the African countries have regulations on the prevention of 
      macroplastic wastes, but the implementations are unsuccessful and most have not yet 
      been established resulting in a threat of microplastics pollution. Thus, the 
      research priorities on microplastic detection should be identified, and the African 
      countries' governments should be more proactive in eradicating macroplastic, which 
      ends up as microplastics, pollutions in the water environments. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: 
      Researches on microplastic pollution in African countries water system is limited .A 
      high microplastics abundance is found in African countries water system.Sampling 
      methods and used analytical techniques for microplastic detection were 
      included.Harmonized standard methods for microplastic pollution research should be 
      established.Combined analytical tools at once should be adopted to detect reliable 
      microplastics.

AB  - Microplastics are continuously released into the terrestrial environment from 
      sources where they are used and produced. These microplastics accumulate in soils, 
      sediments, and freshwater bodies, and some are conveyed via wind and water to the 
      oceans. The concentration gradient between terrestrial inland and coastal regions, 
      the factors that influence the concentration, and the fundamental transport 
      processes that could dynamically affect the distribution of microplastics are 
      unclear. We analyzed microplastic concentration reported in 196 studies from 49 
      countries or territories from all continents and found that microplastic 
      concentrations in soils or sediments and surface water could vary by up to eight 
      orders of magnitude. Mean microplastic concentrations in inland locations such as 
      glacier (191 n L(-1)) and urban stormwater (55 n L(-1)) were up to two orders of 
      magnitude greater than the concentrations in rivers (0.63 n L(-1)) that convey 
      microplastics from inland locations to water bodies in terrestrial boundary such as 
      estuaries (0.15 n L(-1)). However, only 20% of studies reported microplastics below 
      20 μm, indicating the concentration in these systems can change with the improvement 
      of microplastic detection technology. Analysis of data from laboratory studies 
      reveals that biodegradation can also reduce the concentration and size of deposited 
      microplastics in the terrestrial environment. Fiber percentage was higher in the 
      sediments in the coastal areas than the sediments in inland water bodies, indicating 
      fibers are preferentially transported to the terrestrial boundary. Finally, we 
      provide theoretical frameworks to predict microplastics transport and identify 
      potential hotspots where microplastics may accumulate.

AB  - Rivers and effluents have been identified as major pathways for microplastics of 
      terrestrial sources. Moreover, lakes of different dimensions and even in remote 
      locations contain microplastics in striking abundances. This study investigates 
      concentrations of microplastic particles at two lakes in central Italy (Lake 
      Bolsena, Lake Chiusi). A total number of six Manta Trawls have been carried out, two 
      of them one day after heavy winds occurred on Lake Bolsena showing effects on 
      particle distribution of fragments and fibers of varying size categories. 
      Additionally, 36 sediment samples from lakeshores were analyzed for microplastic 
      content. In the surface waters 2.68 to 3.36 particles/m(3) (Lake Chiusi) and 0.82 to 
      4.42 particles/m(3) (Lake Bolsena) were detected, respectively. Main differences 
      between the lakes are attributed to lake characteristics such as surface and 
      catchment area, depth and the presence of local wind patterns and tide range at Lake 
      Bolsena. An event of heavy winds and moderate rainfall prior to one sampling led to 
      an increase of concentrations at Lake Bolsena which is most probable related to 
      lateral land-based and sewage effluent inputs. The abundances of microplastic 
      particles in sediments vary from mean values of 112 (Lake Bolsena) to 
      234 particles/kg dry weight (Lake Chiusi). Lake Chiusi results reveal elevated fiber 
      concentrations compared to those of Lake Bolsena what might be a result of higher 
      organic content and a shift in grain size distribution towards the silt and clay 
      fraction at the shallow and highly eutrophic Lake Chiusi. The distribution of

AB  - The pervasive spread of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) has raised 
      significant concerns on their toxicity in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. 
      These polymer-based materials have implications for plants, wildlife and human 
      health, threatening food chain integrity and ultimate ecosystem resilience. An 
      extensive - and growing - body of literature is available on MP- and NP-associated 
      effects, including in a number of aquatic biota, with as yet limited reports in 
      terrestrial environments. Effects range from no detectable, or very low level, 
      biological effects to more severe outcomes such as (but not limited to) increased 
      mortality rates, altered immune and inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, 
      genetic damage and dysmetabolic changes. A well-established exposure route to MPs 
      and NPs involves ingestion with subsequent incorporation into tissues. MP and NP 
      exposures have also been found to lead to genetic damage, including effects related 
      to mitotic anomalies, or to transmissible damage from sperm cells to their 
      offspring, especially in echinoderms. Effects on the proteome, transcriptome and 
      metabolome warrant ad hoc investigations as these integrated "omics" workflows could 
      provide greater insight into molecular pathways of effect. Given their different 
      physical structures, chemical identity and presumably different modes of action, 
      exposure to different types of MPs and NPs may result in different biological 
      effects in biota, thus comparative investigations of different MPs and NPs are 
      required to ascertain the respective effects. Furthermore, research on MP and NP 
      should also consider their ability to act as vectors for other toxicants, and 
      possible outcomes of exposure may even include effects at the community level, thus 
      requiring investigations in mesocosm models.

AB  - Populations evolve generalist, specialist, and plastic strategies in response to 
      environmental heterogeneity. Describing such within-species variation in phenotype 
      and how it arises is central to understanding a variety of ecological and 
      evolutionary topics. The literature on phenotypic differences among populations is 
      highly biased; for every one article published on a marine species, at least 10 
      articles are published on a terrestrial species and eight focus on terrestrial 
      plants. Here, I outline what we know from the marine literature about geographic 
      variation in phenotype in the sea, with a principal focus on local adaptation. The 
      theory of environmental "grain" predicts that the most likely evolutionary response 
      (e.g., local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, generalism, and balanced 
      polymorphism) depends on the spatial scale of environmental variation relative to 
      the distance that an organism disperses. Consistent with these predictions, 
      phenotypic plasticity is stronger among invertebrates with geographically broad 
      dispersal versus restricted dispersal (i.e., planktonic-dispersers versus 
      direct-developers). However, contrary to predictions, the relative frequency, and 
      spatial scale of local adaptation is not consistently greater among 
      direct-developers relative to planktonic disperers. This indicates that the 
      likelihood of local adaptation depends on other organismal or environmental traits. 
      Two of the most vexing issues that remain include (1) predicting the extent to which 
      barriers to dispersal are a cause versus consequence of phenotypic differentiation 
      and (2) delineating the relative importance of evolutionary forces that favor or 
      impede local adaptation. Understanding the mechanistic basis of the geography of 
      phenotypic differences, or phenogeography, has gained recent momentum because of a 
      need to predict impacts of global climatic change, anthropogenic disturbances, and 
      dispersal of organisms to non-native habitats.

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of microbially made polyesters 
      commercialized as biodegradable plastics. PHA production rates are predicted to 
      increase as concerns around environmental plastic contamination and limited fossil 
      fuel resources have increased the importance of biodegradable and bio-based plastic 
      alternatives. Microbially produced PHA depolymerases are the key enzymes mediating 
      PHA biodegradation, but only a few PHA depolymerases have been well-characterized 
      and screens employing metagenomic sequence data are lacking. Here, we used 3078 
      metagenomes to analyse the distribution of PHA depolymerases in microbial 
      communities from diverse aquatic, terrestrial and waste management systems. We 
      significantly expand the recognized diversity of this protein family by screening 
      1914 Gb of sequence data and identifying 13 869 putative PHA depolymerases in 1295 
      metagenomes. Our results indicate that PHA depolymerases are unevenly distributed 
      across environments. We predicted the highest frequency of PHA depolymerases in 
      wastewater systems and the lowest in marine and thermal springs. In tandem, we 
      screened 5290 metagenome-assembled genomes to describe the phylogenetic distribution 
      of PHA depolymerases, which is substantially broader compared with current cultured 
      representatives. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota are key lineages encoding PHA 
      depolymerases, but PHA depolymerases were predicted from members of the 
      Bdellovibrionota, Methylomirabilota, Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, Spirochaetota, 
      Desulfobacterota, Myxococcota and Planctomycetota.

AB  - The surge in the use of plastic materials, its poor handling and disposal have led 
      to an increase in microplastic pollution in terrestrial environments. Microplastic 
      pollution in soils is of concern due to potential influences on soil properties 
      which play a critical role in plant growth and soil fertility. Moreover, the soil 
      environment is a key nexus linking the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and 
      lithosphere, and thus represents a crucial conduit for pollutant migration from the 
      anthroposphere. In this review we evaluate the effects of microplastics in the soil 
      environment with a specific focus on physical properties and biological function in 
      the rhizosphere. Our review reveals that agricultural sources, particularly plastic 
      mulches and waste applications, represent the main source of soil microplastic 
      inputs. Once in the soil environment, microplastic effects on soil properties are 
      highly variable depending mainly on soil type and microplastic characteristics. Soil 
      properties relating to erosion-risk (i.e., bulk density), structural integrity 
      (i.e., aggregate stability, particularly micro-aggregate stability), and 
      water-storage capacity (i.e., evaporation rate, desiccation) are generally adversely 
      impacted by soil microplastic inputs. Soil microplastic effects on rhizosphere 
      function (i.e., plant health and microbial activity) are remarkably varied with some 
      studies revealing positive impacts, such as enhanced plant-symbiotic fungi 
      associations, from soil plastic additions. However, all identified publications 
      reported at least one detrimental MP-induced impact on plant responses. Finally, our 
      review revealed associations between microplastic properties and soil functional 
      parameters - in particular, polymer size and morphology control soil water-holding 
      properties whereas polymer type influences plant response. These associations will 
      be helpful in targeting future research directions on this important topic that 
      intersects all of the Earth's spheres.

LID - 141
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plastics now pollute marine environments across the globe. On entering 
      these environments, plastics are rapidly colonised by a diverse community of 
      microorganisms termed the plastisphere. Members of the plastisphere have a myriad of 
      diverse functions typically found in any biofilm but, additionally, a number of 
      marine plastisphere studies have claimed the presence of plastic-biodegrading 
      organisms, although with little mechanistic verification. Here, we obtained a 
      microbial community from marine plastic debris and analysed the community succession 
      across 6 weeks of incubation with different polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
      products as the sole carbon source, and further characterised the mechanisms 
      involved in PET degradation by two bacterial isolates from the plastisphere. 
      RESULTS: We found that all communities differed significantly from the inoculum and 
      were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, i.e. Alteromonadaceae and Thalassospiraceae 
      at early time points, Alcanivoraceae at later time points and Vibrionaceae 
      throughout. The large number of encoded enzymes involved in PET degradation found in 
      predicted metagenomes and the observation of polymer oxidation by FTIR analyses both 
      suggested PET degradation was occurring. However, we were unable to detect 
      intermediates of PET hydrolysis with metabolomic analyses, which may be attributed 
      to their rapid depletion by the complex community. To further confirm the PET 
      biodegrading potential within the plastisphere of marine plastic debris, we used a 
      combined proteogenomic and metabolomic approach to characterise amorphous PET 
      degradation by two novel marine isolates, Thioclava sp. BHET1 and Bacillus sp. 
      BHET2. The identification of PET hydrolytic intermediates by metabolomics confirmed 
      that both isolates were able to degrade PET. High-throughput proteomics revealed 
      that whilst Thioclava sp. BHET1 used the degradation pathway identified in 
      terrestrial environment counterparts, these were absent in Bacillus sp. BHET2, 
      indicating that either the enzymes used by this bacterium share little homology with 
      those characterised previously, or that this bacterium uses a novel pathway for PET 
      degradation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results of our multi-OMIC characterisation of 
      PET degradation provide a significant step forwards in our understanding of marine 
      plastic degradation by bacterial isolates and communities and evidences the 
      biodegrading potential extant in the plastisphere of marine plastic debris. Video

      vitro.

AB  - In recent decades, many toxicological tests based on in vivo or in vitro models, 
      mainly from mammalian (rat-mouse) and fish species, were used to assess the risks 
      raised by contact or ingestion of molecules of pharmaceutical, agricultural, or 
      natural origin. But no, or few, in vitro tests using other non-mammalian models such 
      as bird have been explored despite their advantages: the embryonic gonads of birds 
      have a high plasticity of development sensitive to estrogen, and sperm production is 
      nearly two times faster than in rodents. Hence, we have established an in vitro 
      culture of germ cells and somatic cells from chicken post-natal testis, and we have 
      evaluated the sensitivity against the endocrine disruptor compound 
      mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) in comparison to previous studies using rodent 
      and human models. After 96 h of exposure in presence of 10 μM MEHP, chicken 
      seminiferous tubules cultures present a structural alteration, a reduction in cell 
      proliferation and in germ cells population. Apoptosis of germ and somatic cells 
      increases in presence of 1 μM MEHP. Furthermore, MEHP does not affect inhibin B and 
      lactate production by Sertoli cells. These results are in accordance with previous 
      studies using rat, mice, or human culture of testicular cells and in similar range 
      of exposures or even better sensitivity for some "end-points" (biological 
      parameters). In conclusion, the establishment of this postnatal testicular cells 
      culture could be considered as an alternative method to in vivo experiments 
      frequently used for evaluating the impact on the terrestrial wildlife species. This 
      method could be also complementary to mammal model due to the limiting number of 
      animals used and its elevated sensitivity.

      arthropod species.

LID - 20170238
AB  - Major biological and biogeographical rules link body size variation with latitude or 
      environmental temperature, and these rules are often studied in isolation. Within 
      multivoltine species, seasonal temperature variation can cause substantial changes 
      in adult body size, as subsequent generations experience different developmental 
      conditions. Yet, unlike other size patterns, these common seasonal temperature-size 
      gradients have never been collectively analysed. We undertake the largest analysis 
      to date of seasonal temperature-size gradients in multivoltine arthropods, including 
      102 aquatic and terrestrial species from 71 global locations. Adult size declines in 
      warmer seasons in 86% of the species examined. Aquatic species show approximately 
      2.5-fold greater reduction in size per °C of warming than terrestrial species, 
      supporting the hypothesis that greater oxygen limitation in water than in air forces 
      aquatic species to exhibit greater plasticity in body size with temperature. Total 
      percentage change in size over the annual cycle appears relatively constant with 
      annual temperature range but varies between environments, such that the overall size 
      reduction in aquatic-developing species (approx. 31%) is almost threefold greater 
      than in terrestrial species (approx. 11%). For the first time, we show that strong 
      correlations exist between seasonal temperature-size gradients, laboratory responses 
      and latitudinal-size clines, suggesting that these patterns share common drivers.

TI  - Opportunistically collected data from aerial surveys reveal spatio-temporal 
      distribution patterns of marine debris in German waters.
PG  - 2893-2903
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-10610-9 [doi]
AB  - Marine debris is known for its ubiquitousness and harmful effects on marine life. 
      This study is the first analysis to provide information on the distribution of 
      floating marine debris in German waters using aerial survey data collected between 
      2002 and 2016. During regular harbour porpoise monitoring flights, 191,167 km were 
      covered and 26,512 floating debris items recorded (average encounter rate 0.1387 
      items/km). Debris was encountered more often in the North Sea than in the Baltic Sea 
      (0.16 items/km; 0.08 items/km). The average encounter rate was higher in offshore 
      waters than in coastal areas. Overlaps of marine debris distribution with 'Special 
      Areas of Conservation' are a particular reason for concern. Moreover, the spring 
      months (March-May) were identified to be the time of the year with the highest 
      average encounter rates for marine debris. Fishing-related debris was shown to 
      contribute up to 25% of the total number of all observed items. This study shows 
      that opportunistically collected data on marine debris from aerial surveys are 
      valuable for identifying distribution patterns of floating debris without additional 
      survey effort and costs. These data can be used as baseline information to inform 
      management schemes such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

TI  - Egg clutch dehydration induces early hatching in red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis

AB  - Terrestrial eggs have evolved repeatedly in tropical anurans exposing embryos to the 
      new threat of dehydration. Red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, lay eggs on 
      plants over water. Maternally provided water allows shaded eggs in humid sites to 
      develop to hatching without rainfall, but unshaded eggs and those in less humid 
      sites can die from dehydration. Hatching responses of amphibian eggs to dry 
      conditions are known from two lineages with independent origins of terrestrial eggs. 
      Here, we experimentally tested for dehydration-induced early hatching in another 
      lineage (Agalychnis callidryas, Phyllomedusidae), representing a third independent 
      origin of terrestrial eggs. We also investigated how dehydration affected egg and 
      clutch structure, and egg mortality. We collected clutches from a pond in Gamboa, 
      Panama, and randomly allocated them to wet or dry treatments at age 1 day. Embryos 
      hatched earlier from dry clutches than from wet clutches, accelerating hatching by 
      ∼11%. Clutch thickness and egg diameter were affected by dehydration, diverging 
      between treatments over time. Meanwhile, mortality in dry clutches was six-fold 
      higher than in control clutches. With this study, early hatching responses to escape 
      mortality from egg dehydration are now known from three anuran lineages with 
      independent origins of terrestrial eggs, suggesting they may be widespread. Further 
      studies are needed to understand how terrestrial amphibian eggs can respond to, or 
      will be affected by, rapid changes in climate over the next decades.

TI  - Loss of heterophylly in aquatic plants: not ABA-mediated stress but exogenous ABA 
      treatment induces stomatal leaves in Potamogeton perfoliatus.
PG  - 853-862
LID - 10.1007/s10265-016-0844-x [doi]
AB  - Heterophyllous aquatic plants produce aerial (i.e., floating and terrestrial) and 
      submerged leaves-the latter lack stomata-while homophyllous plants contain only 
      submerged leaves, and cannot survive on land. To identify whether differences in 
      morphogenetic potential and/or physiological stress responses are responsible for 
      variation in phenotypic plasticity between two plants types, responses to abscisic 
      acid (ABA) and salinity stress were compared between the closely related, but 
      ecologically diverse pondweeds, Potamogeton wrightii (heterophyllous) and P. 
      perfoliatus (homophyllous). The ABA-treated (1 or 10 μM) P. wrightii plants 
      exhibited heterophylly and produced leaves with stomata. The obligate submerged P. 
      perfoliatus plants were able to produce stomata on their leaves, but there were no 
      changes to leaf shape, and stomatal production occurred only at a high ABA 
      concentration (10 μM). Under salinity stress conditions, only P. wrightii leaves 
      formed stomata. Additionally, the expression of stress-responsive NCED genes, which 
      encode a key enzyme in ABA biosynthesis, was consistently up-regulated in P. 
      wrightii, but only temporarily in P. perfoliatus. The observed species-specific gene 
      expression patterns may be responsible for the induction or suppression of stomatal 
      production during exposure to salinity stress. These results suggest that the two 
      Potamogeton species have an innate morphogenetic ability to form stomata, but the 
      actual production of stomata depends on ABA-mediated stress responses specific to 
      each species and habitat.

AB  - Seabirds are apex predators in the marine environment and well-known ecosystem 
      engineers, capable of changing their terrestrial habitats by introducing 
      marine-derived nutrients via deposition of guano and other allochthonous inputs. 
      However, with the health of the world's oceans under threat due to anthropogenic 
      pressures such as organic, inorganic, and physical pollutants, seabirds are 
      depositing these same pollutants wherever they come to land. Using data from 2018 to 
      2020, we quantify how the Flesh-footed Shearwater (Ardenna carneipes) has 
      inadvertently introduced physical pollutants to their colonies on Lord Howe Island, 
      a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Tasman Sea and their largest breeding colony, 
      through a mix of regurgitated pellet (bolus) deposition and carcasses containing 
      plastic debris. The density of plastics within the shearwater colonies ranged 
      between 1.32 and 3.66 pieces/m(2) (mean ± SE: 2.18 ± 0.32), and a total of 688,480 
      (95% CI: 582,409-800,877) pieces are deposited on the island each year. Our research 
      demonstrates that seabirds are a transfer mechanism for marine-derived plastics, 
      reintroducing items back into the terrestrial environment, thus making seabird 
      colonies a sink for plastic debris. This phenomenon is likely occurring in seabird 
      colonies across the globe and will increase in severity as global plastic production 
      and marine plastic pollution accelerates without adequate mitigation strategies.

TI  - Root morphophysiology changes during the habitat transition from soil to canopy of 
      the aroid vine Rhodospatha oblongata.
PG  - 347-360
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcaa182 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aroid vine Rhodospatha oblongata is characterized by a 
      habitat change from terrestrial to canopy, relying on aerial roots at maturity to 
      obtain water and nutrients from the forest soil. We hypothesize that 
      morphophysiological acclimation occurs in roots as they grow under atmospheric 
      conditions. These changes would guarantee the whole-plant survival of aroid vines in 
      the new and potentially stressful habitat of the canopy. METHODS: Terrestrial and 
      aerial roots were compared on a morphophysiological basis. Root anatomy, water 
      balance, water absorption capacity via fluorescent tracer, and photochemical 
      activity via chlorophyll fluorescence were measured. KEY RESULTS: While thin 
      fasciculate roots occur on terrestrial crawling individuals, two clearly distinct 
      aerial roots (anchor and feeder) are produced on canopy individuals, which both 
      adhere to the host trunk. The colour of both aerial roots changes during development 
      from red and brownish to striped and green at maturity. Colour changes are induced 
      by the replacement of epidermis, exodermis and outer cortex by an inner layer of 
      lignified cork on the root region exposed to the atmosphere. In the root region that 
      is in contact with the host, covering substitutions do not occur and both exodermis 
      and lignified cork, along with several epidermal hairs, appear. Water retention 
      capacity was higher in green roots than in other root types. Rehydration capacity 
      via water absorption by hairs of aerial roots was confirmed by fluorescence. 
      Chlorophyll fluorescence data indicated low levels of photosynthetic capacity in 
      aerial roots. CONCLUSIONS: Plants should evolve strategies to survive stress 
      situations. The transition from soil to canopy imposes abiotic changes and 
      potentially stressful situations on R. oblongata. We conclude that the 
      morphophysiological changes observed represent an important strategy that permits 
      the maintenance of aroid roots and the survival of R. oblongata in the canopy.

TI  - The befuddling nature of mouse lemur hands and feet at Bezà Mahafaly, SW Madagascar.
LID - 10.1002/ajp.22680 [doi]
AB  - The reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) possesses striking phenotypic 
      and behavioral variation. This project investigates differences in autopod 
      proportions in neighboring populations of M. griseorufus from the Special Reserve at 
      Bezà Mahafaly in southwest Madagascar. One population resides in an environment 
      generally preferred by M. griseorufus-a spiny forest with large-trunked trees, 
      vertically-oriented supports, and more open ground, while the other resides in a 
      gallery forest with abundant small, often horizontal peripheral branches in high 
      canopy. We demonstrate significant interpopulation differences in autopod 
      morphophology despite no evidence of divergence in mitochondrial cytochrome b. We 
      test two hypotheses regarding ultimate causation. The first, based on the Fine 
      Branch Arborealism Hypothesis (FBAH), holds that autopod differences are related to 
      different locomotor practices in the two environments, and the second, based on the 
      Narrow Niche Hypothesis (NNH), holds that the observed differences reflect a 
      relaxation (from ancestral to descendant conditions) of selective pressure for 
      terrestrial locomotion and/or use of large, vertical supports combined with positive 
      selection for locomoting in peripheral branch settings. Our data conform well to 
      FBAH expectations and show some support for the NNH. Individuals from the gallery 
      forest possess disproportionally long posterior digits that facilitate locomotion on 
      small, flexible canopy supports while individuals from the spiny forest possess 
      shorter posterior digits and a longer pollex/hallux that increase functional 
      grasping diameter for large vertical supports and facilitate efficient ground 
      locomotion. Focal individual data confirm differences in how often individuals 
      descend to the ground and use vertical supports. We further show that predispersal 
      juveniles, like adults, possess autopod morphologies suited to their natal forest. 
      We explore two proximate mechanisms that could generate these cheiridial 
      differences. The first posits an in vivo plastic response to different locomotor 
      behaviors, the second posits differences that manifest in early development.

AB  - Physicochemical properties of nanoparticles influence their environmental fate and 
      toxicity, and studies investigating this are vital for a holistic approach towards a 
      comprehensive and adequate environmental risk assessment. In this study, we 
      investigated the effects of size, surface coating (charge) of silver nanoparticles 
      (AgNPs) - a most commonly-used nanoparticle-type, on the bioaccumulation in, and 
      toxicity (survival, growth, cocoon production) to the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus. 
      AgNPs were synthesized in three sizes: 20, 35 and 50 nm. Surface-coating with bovine 
      serum albumin (AgNP_BSA), chitosan (AgNP_Chit), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (AgNP_PVP) 
      produced negative, positive and neutral particles respectively. In a 28-day 
      sub-chronic reproduction toxicity test, earthworms were exposed to these AgNPs in 
      soil (0-250 mg Ag/kg soil DW). Earthworms were also exposed to AgNO(3) at 
      concentrations below known EC(50). Total Ag tissue concentration indicated uptake by 
      earthworms was generally highest for the AgNP_BSA especially at the lower exposure 
      concentration ranges, and seems to reach a plateau level between 50 and 100 mg Ag/kg 
      soil DW. Reproduction was impaired at high concentrations of all AgNPs tested, with 
      AgNP_BSA particles being the most toxic. The EC(50) for the 20 nm AgNP_BSA was 
      66.8 mg Ag/kg soil, with exposure to <60 mg Ag/kg soil already showing a decrease in 
      the cocoon production. Thus, based on reproductive toxicity, the particles ranked: 
      AgNP_BSA (negative) > AgNP_PVP (neutral) > Chitosan (positive). Size had an 
      influence on uptake and toxicity of the AgNP_PVP, but not for AgNP_BSA nor 
      AgNP_Chit. This study provides essential information on the role of physicochemical 
      properties of AgNPs in influencing uptake by a terrestrial organism L. rubellus 
      under environmentally relevant conditions. It also provides evidence of the 
      influence of surface coating (charge) and the limited effect of size in the range of 
      20-50 nm, in driving uptake and toxicity of the AgNPs tested.

TI  - Putting μ/g in a new light: plasticity in life history switch points reflects 
      fine-scale adaptive responses.
PG  - 2192-202
AB  - Life history theory predicts that organisms with complex life cycles should 
      transition between life stages when the ratio of growth rate (g) to risk of 
      mortality (µ) in the current stage falls below that in the subsequent stage. 
      Empirical support for this idea has been mixed. Implicit in both theory and 
      empirical work is that the risk of mortality in the subsequent stage is unknown. 
      However, some embryos and larvae of both vertebrates and invertebrates assess cues 
      of post-transition predation risk and alter the timing of hatching or metamorphosis 
      accordingly. Furthermore, although life history switch points of prey have 
      traditionally been treated as discrete shifts in morphology or habitat, for many 
      organisms they are continuous transitional periods within which the timing of 
      specific developmental and behavioral events can be plastic. We studied red-eyed 
      treefrogs (Agalychnis callidryas), which detect predators of both larvae and 
      metamorphs, to test if plastic changes during the process of metamorphosis could 
      reconcile the mismatch between life history theory and empirical data and if 
      plasticity in an earlier stage transition (hatching) would affect plasticity at a 
      subsequent stage transition (metamorphosis). We reared tadpoles from hatching until 
      metamorphosis in a full-factorial cross of two hatching ages (early- vs. 
      late-hatched) and the presence or absence of free-roaming predators of larvae (giant 
      water bugs) and metamorphs (fishing spiders). Hatching age affected the times from 
      oviposition to tail resorption and from hatching to emergence onto land, but did not 
      alter responses to predators or developmental stage at emergence. Tadpoles did not 
      alter their age at emergence or tail resorption in response to larval or metamorph 
      predators, despite the fact that predators reduced tadpole density by ~30%. However, 
      developmental stage at emergence and time needed to complete metamorphosis in the 
      terrestrial environment were plastic and consistent with predictions of the 
      "minimize µ/g" framework. Our results demonstrate that likely adaptive changes in 
      life history transitions occur at previously unappreciated timescales. Consideration 
      of plasticity in the developmental timing of ecologically important events within 
      metamorphosis, rather than treating it as a discrete switch point, may help to 
      reconcile inconsistencies between empirical studies of predator effects and 
      expectations of long-standing ecological theory.

AB  - Synthetic polymers, commonly referred to as plastics, are anthropogenic contaminants 
      that adversely affect the natural ecosystems. The continuous disposal of long 
      lifespan plastics has resulted in the accumulation of plastic waste, leading to 
      significant pollution of both marine and terrestrial habitats. Scientific pursuit to 
      seek environment-friendly materials from renewable resources has focused on 
      cellulose, the primary reinforcement component of the cell wall of plants, as it is 
      the most abundantly available biopolymer on earth. This paper provides an overview 
      on the current state of science on nanocellulose research; highlighting its 
      extraction procedures from lignocellulosic biomass. Literature shows that the 
      process used to obtain nanocellulose from lignocellulosic biomass greatly influences 
      its morphology, properties and surface chemistry. The efficacy of chemical methods 
      that use alkali, acid, bleaching agents, ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvent for 
      pre-treatment of biomass is discussed. There has been a continuous endeavour to 
      optimize the pre-treatment protocol as it is specific to lignocellulosic biomass and 
      also depends on factors such as nature of the biomass, process and environmental 
      parameters and economic viability. Nanofibers are primarily isolated through 
      mechanical fibrillation while nanocrystals are predominantly extracted using acid 
      hydrolysis. A concise overview on the ways to improve the yield of nanocellulose 
      from cellulosic biomass is also presented in this review. This work also reviews the 
      techniques used to modify the surface properties of nanocellulose by functionalizing 
      surface hydroxyl groups to impart desirable hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. An 
      assessment on the emerging application of nanocellulose with an emphasis on 
      development of nanocomposite materials for designing environmentally sustainable 
      products is incorporated. Finally, the status of the industrial production of 
      nanocellulose presented, which indicates that there is a continuously increased 
      demand for cellulose nanomaterials. The demand for cellulose is expected to increase 
      further due to its increasing and broadening applications.

TI  - Quantifying phenotype-environment matching in the protected Kerry spotted slug 
      (Mollusca: Gastropoda) using digital photography: exposure to UV radiation 
      determines cryptic colour morphs.
PG  - 35

LID - 35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal colours and patterns commonly play a role in reducing detection 
      by predators, social signalling or increasing survival in response to some other 
      environmental pressure. Different colour morphs can evolve within populations 
      exposed to different levels of predation or environmental stress and in some cases 
      can arise within the lifetime of an individual as the result of phenotypic 
      plasticity. Skin pigmentation is variable for many terrestrial slugs (Mollusca: 
      Gastropoda), both between and within species. The Kerry spotted slug Geomalacus 
      maculosus Allman, an EU protected species, exhibits two distinct phenotypes: brown 
      individuals occur in forested habitats whereas black animals live in open habitats 
      such as blanket bog. Both colour forms are spotted and each type strongly resembles 
      the substrate of their habitat, suggesting that G. maculosus possesses camouflage. 
      RESULTS: Analysis of digital images of wild slugs demonstrated that each colour 
      morph is strongly and positively correlated with the colour properties of the 
      background in each habitat but not with the substrate of the alternative habitats, 
      suggesting habitat-specific crypsis. Experiments were undertaken on 
      laboratory-reared juvenile slugs to investigate whether ultraviolet (UV) radiation 
      or diet could induce colour change. Exposure to UV radiation induced the black (bog) 
      phenotype whereas slugs reared in darkness did not change colour. Diet had no effect 
      on juvenile colouration. Examination of skin tissue from specimens exposed to either 
      UV or dark treatments demonstrated that UV-exposed slugs had significantly higher 
      concentrations of black pigment in their epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that colour dimorphism in G. maculosus is an example of phenotypic 
      plasticity which is explained by differential exposure to UV radiation. Each 
      resulting colour morph provides incidental camouflage against the different coloured 
      substrate of each habitat. This, to our knowledge, is the first documented example 
      of colour change in response to UV radiation in a terrestrial mollusc. Pigmentation 
      appears to be correlated with a number of behavioural traits in G. maculosus, and we 
      suggest that understanding melanisation in other terrestrial molluscs may be useful 
      in the study of pestiferous and invasive species. The implications of colour change 
      for G. maculosus conservation are also discussed.

AB  - A new tool was developed for microplastics (MPs) investigation in the water column. 
      It can collect several cubic meters of water from predefined water layers down to 
      100 m. The tool was tested in the Baltic Sea during the period of spring thermocline 
      formation. Strong MPs stratification was observed at all of the sampled stations. On 
      coastal stations (~30 m deep), stratification with high fibers content was 
      associated with the proximity of terrestrial sources and estuarine discharges, while 
      on off-shore stations the variability of MPs was related to vertical thermohaline 
      structure. Mean MPs content was the 32.2 (SD 50.4) pcs/m(3). Elevated MPs 
      concentrations were observed in subsurface, near-bottom and thermohaline layers 
      compared with intermediate layers. The heterogeneity of MPs distribution suggests 
      that MPs particles can be retained above the density-gradient layers in coastal seas 
      and the World Ocean.

AB  - Microplastic contamination in soil has received increasing attention since excessive 
      plastic debris has been emitted directly into the terrestrial environment. Once 
      released into the terrestrial environment, microplastics can be aged via photo- and 
      thermally-initiated oxidative degradation, hetero-aggregation, and bioturbation. 
      Aging affects the physiochemical properties of microplastics with the increase of 
      surface roughness and oxygen-containing groups, which could enhance the sorption and 
      mobility of microplastics in the soil and groundwater environment. However, the 
      interactions among aging, sorption, and transport of microplastics in the 
      terrestrial system have not been unveiled. This review clarifies the key processes 
      of microplastics transport pathways in soil and groundwater ecosystems influenced by 
      aging and sorption under various scenarios. Co-transport of microplastics and sorbed 
      contaminants are also addressed to help understand the risks associated with heavy 
      metals, organic contaminants, and engineered nanoparticles in the soil environment. 
      Overall, this review elaborates the most pressing research limitations on the 
      present literature and highlights the future perspectives to investigate the 
      possible broad transport pathways of microplastics in soil.

TI  - Skeletal stiffening in an amphibious fish out of water is a response to increased 
      body weight.
PG  - 3621-3631
LID - 10.1242/jeb.161638 [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial animals must support their bodies against gravity, while aquatic animals 
      are effectively weightless because of buoyant support from water. Given this 
      evolutionary history of minimal gravitational loading of fishes in water, it has 
      been hypothesized that weight-responsive musculoskeletal systems evolved during the 
      tetrapod invasion of land and are thus absent in fishes. Amphibious fishes, however, 
      experience increased effective weight when out of water - are these fishes 
      responsive to gravitational loading? Contrary to the tetrapod-origin hypothesis, we 
      found that terrestrial acclimation reversibly increased gill arch stiffness (∼60% 
      increase) in the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus when loaded normally by 
      gravity, but not under simulated microgravity. Quantitative proteomics analysis 
      revealed that this change in mechanical properties occurred via increased abundance 
      of proteins responsible for bone mineralization in other fishes as well as in 
      tetrapods. Type X collagen, associated with endochondral bone growth, increased in 
      abundance almost ninefold after terrestrial acclimation. Collagen isoforms known to 
      promote extracellular matrix cross-linking and cause tissue stiffening, such as 
      types IX and XII collagen, also increased in abundance. Finally, more densely packed 
      collagen fibrils in both gill arches and filaments were observed microscopically in 
      terrestrially acclimated fish. Our results demonstrate that the mechanical 
      properties of the fish musculoskeletal system can be fine-tuned in response to 
      changes in effective body weight using biochemical pathways similar to those in 
      mammals, suggesting that weight sensing is an ancestral vertebrate trait rather than 
      a tetrapod innovation.

AB  - Muscle fiber types in the pectoral fins of fishes have rarely been examined, despite 
      their morphological and functional diversity. Here, we describe the distribution of 
      fast and slow muscle fibers in the pectoral fins of Polypterus senegalus, an 
      amphibious, basal actinopterygian. Each of the four muscle groups examined using 
      mATPase staining showed distinct fiber-type regionalization. Comparison between fish 
      raised in aquatic and terrestrial environments revealed terrestrially reared fish 
      possess 28% more fast muscle compared with aquatically reared fish. The pattern of 
      proximal-distal variation in the abductors differed, with a relative decrease in 
      fast muscle fibers near the pectoral girdle in aquatic fish compared with an 
      increase in terrestrial fish. Terrestrially reared fish also possess a greater 
      proportion of very small diameter fibers, suggesting that they undergo more growth 
      via hyperplasia. These observations may be a further example of adaptive plasticity 
      in Polypterus, allowing for greater bursts of power during terrestrial locomotion.

TI  - Bone bonding at natural and biomaterial surfaces.
PG  - 5058-67
AB  - Bone bonding is occurring in each of us and all other terrestrial vertebrates 
      throughout life at bony remodeling sites. The surface created by the bone-resorbing 
      osteoclast provides a three-dimensionally complex surface with which the cement 
      line, the first matrix elaborated during de novo bone formation, interdigitates and 
      is interlocked. The structure and composition of this interfacial bony matrix has 
      been conserved during evolution across species; and we have known for over a decade 
      that this interfacial matrix can be recapitulated at a biomaterial surface implanted 
      in bone, given appropriate healing conditions. No evidence has emerged to suggest 
      that bone bonding to artificial materials is any different from this natural 
      biological process. Given this understanding it is now possible to explain why 
      bone-bonding biomaterials are not restricted to the calcium-phosphate-based 
      bioactive materials as was once thought. Indeed, in the absence of surface porosity, 
      calcium phosphate biomaterials are not bone bonding. On the contrary, non-bonding 
      materials can be rendered bone bonding by modifying their surface topography. This 
      paper argues that the driving force for bone bonding is bone formation by contact 
      osteogenesis, but that this has to occur on a sufficiently stable recipient surface 
      which has micron-scale surface topography with undercuts in the sub-micron 
      scale-range.

PG  - e1473

LID - e1473
AB  - Vegetative characters are widely used in the taxonomy of the amphibious genus 
      Elatine L. However, these usually show great variation not just between species but 
      between their aquatic and terrestrial forms. In the present study we examine the 
      variation of seed and vegetative characters in nine Elatine species (E. 
      brachysperma, E. californica, E. gussonei, E. hexandra, E. hungarica, E. hydropiper, 
      E. macropoda, E. orthosperma and E. triandra) to reveal the extension of plasticity 
      induced by the amphibious environment, and to test character reliability for species 
      identification. Cultivated plant clones were kept under controlled conditions 
      exposed to either aquatic or terrestrial environmental conditions. Six vegetative 
      characters (length of stem, length of internodium, length of lamina, width of 
      lamina, length of petioles, length of pedicel) and four seed characters (curvature, 
      number of pits / lateral row, 1st and 2nd dimension) were measured on 50 fruiting 
      stems of the aquatic and on 50 stems of the terrestrial form of the same clone. MDA, 
      NPMANOVA Random Forest classification and cluster analysis were used to unravel the 
      morphological differences between aquatic and terrestrial forms. The results of MDA 
      cross-validated and Random Forest classification clearly indicated that only seed 
      traits are stable within species (i.e., different forms of the same species keep 
      similar morphology). Consequently, only seed morphology is valuable for taxonomic 
      purposes since vegetative traits are highly influenced by environmental factors.

TI  - Microplastics accumulate fungal pathogens in terrestrial ecosystems.
PG  - 13214
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-92405-7 [doi]
AB  - Microplastic (MP) is a pervasive pollutant in nature that is colonised by diverse 
      groups of microbes, including potentially pathogenic species. Fungi have been 
      largely neglected in this context, despite their affinity for plastics and their 
      impact as pathogens. To unravel the role of MP as a carrier of fungal pathogens in 
      terrestrial ecosystems and the immediate human environment, epiplastic mycobiomes 
      from municipal plastic waste from Kenya were deciphered using ITS metabarcoding as 
      well as a comprehensive meta-analysis, and visualised via scanning electron as well 
      as confocal laser scanning microscopy. Metagenomic and microscopic findings provided 
      complementary evidence that the terrestrial plastisphere is a suitable ecological 
      niche for a variety of fungal organisms, including important animal and plant 
      pathogens, which formed the plastisphere core mycobiome. We show that MPs serve as 
      selective artificial microhabitats that not only attract distinct fungal 
      communities, but also accumulate certain opportunistic human pathogens, such as 
      cryptococcal and Phoma-like species. Therefore, MP must be regarded a persistent 
      reservoir and potential vector for fungal pathogens in soil environments. Given the 
      increasing amount of plastic waste in terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, this 
      interrelation may have severe consequences for the trans-kingdom and 
      multi-organismal epidemiology of fungal infections on a global scale.

PG  - 579-93
LID - 10.1007/s12010-009-8808-4 [doi]
AB  - During our search for Streptomyces spp. as new producers of bioactive secondary 
      metabolites, the ethyl acetate extract of the new terrestrial Streptomyces isolate 
      TN262 delivered eight antimicrobially active compounds. They were identified as 
      1-acetyl-beta-carboline (1), tryptophol (2), cineromycin B (3), 
      2,3-dihydrocineromycin B (4), cyclo-(tyrosylprolyl) (5), 3-(hydroxyacetyl)-indole 
      (6), brevianamide F (7), and cis-cyclo-(L-prolyl-L-leucyl) (8). Three further 
      metabolites were detected in the unpolar fractions using GC-MS and tentatively 
      assigned as benzophenone (9), N-butyl-benzenesulfonamide (10), and hexanedioic 
      acid-bis-(2-ethylhexyl) ester (11). This last compound is known as plasticizer 
      derivatives, but it has never been described from natural sources. In this article, 
      we describe the identification of the new Streptomyces sp. isolate TN262 using its 
      cultural characteristics, the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding 16S rRNA gene 
      and the phylogenetic analysis, followed by optimization, large-scale fermentation, 
      isolation of the bioactive constituents, and determination of their structures. The 
      biological activity of compounds (2), (3), (4), and those of the unpolar fractions 
      was addressed as well.

TI  - Ingestion of anthropogenic materials by yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) in 
      natural, urban, and landfill sites along Portugal in relation to diet composition.

AB  - Pollution is a global concern, increasing rapidly throughout marine and terrestrial 
      ecosystems, and affecting many species. Urbanization enhances waste production, 
      leading to the opening of landfills that constitute a spatially and temporally 
      predictable food source for opportunistic species. Several species of gulls are 
      known to exploit and breed in urban areas, taking advantage of accessible and 
      diverse food resources. The exploitation of anthropogenic food subsidies at sea 
      (e.g. fishery discards), urban sites, and landfills leads to debris ingestion by 
      gulls with potential negative effects. Here we characterize anthropogenic debris 
      ingested by yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) along Portugal, by analysing the 
      content of pellets collected in (1) natural and urban breeding locations, and in (2) 
      urban and landfill resting sites, to assess seasonal patterns in the ingestion of 
      anthropogenic debris. We also relate diet with the presence of anthropogenic debris. 
      Debris materials were found in 28.8% of pellets from breeding locations (natural and 
      urban) and in 89.7% of pellets from resting sites (urban and landfill). Gulls from 
      the most urbanized breeding location exhibited higher levels of ingested materials 
      during the entire breeding cycle, however, gulls from a natural breeding site also 
      ingested high levels of debris during the pre-breeding season. At resting sites, 
      small seasonal differences were detected in the number and mass of debris items 
      ingested, which were both higher during spring and summer. Gulls that typically fed 
      on pelagic fish had significantly less sheet and fragment plastics in their pellets. 
      The presence of certain debris categories in gull pellets was positively related to 
      the presence of some prey items, suggesting that gulls may accidentally ingest 
      debris while foraging at multiple habitats. The quantity of anthropogenic materials 
      ingested by gulls from urban locations and landfills indicates a need for improved 
      waste management.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastics in the environment are of great 
      public concern due to their potential risk to human health. Microplastics can form 
      distinct bacterial communities and absorb pollutants from the surrounding 
      environment, which provide potential hosts and exert possible selection pressure of 
      ARGs. We provide a practical evaluation of the scientific literature regarding this 
      issue. The occurrence and transport of ARGs on microplastics in wastewater treatment 
      plants, aquatic, terrestrial, and air environments were summarized. Selective 
      enrichment of ARGs and antibiotic resistance bacteria on microplastics have been 
      confirmed in different environments. Aggregates may be crucial to understand the 
      behavior and transport of ARGs on microplastics, especially in the aquatic and 
      terrestrial environment. Microplastics could be a carrier of ARGs between the 
      environment and animals. Accumulation of pollutants and dense bacterial communities 
      on microplastics provide favorable conditions for higher transfer rate and evolution 
      of ARGs. More studies are still needed to understand the enrichment, transport, and 
      transfer of ARGs on microplastics and provide a fundamental basis for evaluating 
      their exposure health risk to humans.

TI  - On the evolution of plant thermomorphogenesis.
LID - erab310 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab310 [doi]
AB  - Plants have a remarkable capacity to acclimate to their environment. Acclimation is 
      enabled to a large degree by phenotypic plasticity, the extent of which confers a 
      selective advantage, especially in natural habitats. Certain key events in evolution 
      triggered adaptive bursts necessary to cope with drastic environmental changes. One 
      such event was the colonization of land 400-500 mya. Compared to most aquatic 
      habitats, fluctuations in abiotic parameters became more pronounced, generating 
      significant selection pressure. To endure these harsh conditions, plants needed to 
      adapt their physiology and morphology and to increase the range of phenotypic 
      plasticity. In addition to drought stress and high light, high temperatures and 
      fluctuation thereof were among the biggest challenges faced by terrestrial plants. 
      Thermomorphogenesis research has emerged as a new sub-discipline of the plant 
      sciences and aims to understand how plants acclimate to elevated ambient 
      temperatures through changes in architecture. While we have begun to understand how 
      angiosperms sense and respond to elevated ambient temperature, very little is known 
      about thermomorphogenesis in plant lineages with less complex body plans. It is 
      unclear when thermomorphogenesis initially evolved and how this depended on 
      morphological complexity. In this review, we take an evolutionary-physiological 
      perspective and generate hypotheses about the emergence of thermomorphogenesis.

TI  - House crickets can accumulate polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) directly from 
      polyurethane foam common in consumer products.
PG  - 500-5
LID - 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.10.014 [doi]
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are added at percent levels to 
      many polymers and textiles abundant in human spaces and vehicles, wherein they have 
      been long assumed to be tightly sequestered. However, the mgkg(-1) burdens recently 
      detected in indoor dust testify to substantial releases. The bulk of released PBDEs 
      remain in the terrestrial environment, yet comparatively little research focuses on 
      this compartment. There, insects/arthropods, such as crickets, are the most abundant 
      invertebrate organisms and facilitate the trophic transfer of contaminants by 
      breaking down complex organic matter (including discarded polymers) and serving as 
      food for other organisms. Our experiments revealed that house crickets (Acheta 
      domesticus) provided uncontaminated food and free access to PUF containing Penta-BDE 
      (8.7%drywt) for 28 d accumulated substantial PBDE body burdens. Crickets allowed to 
      depurate gut contents exhibited whole body burdens of up to 13.4 mg kg(-1) lipid 
      ΣPenta-BDE, 1000-fold higher than typically reported in humans. Non-depurated 
      crickets and molted exoskeletons incurred even higher ΣPenta-BDE, up to 80.6 and 
      63.3 mg kg(-1) lipid, respectively. Congener patterns of whole crickets and molts 
      resembled those of PUF and the commercial Penta-BDE formulation, DE-71, indicative 
      of minimal discrimination or biotransformation. Accumulation factor (AF) 
      calculations were hampered by uncertainties in determining actual PUF ingestion. 
      However, estimated AFs were low, in the range of 10(-4)-10(-3), suggesting that 
      polymer-PBDE interactions limited uptake. Nonetheless, results indicate that 
      substantial PBDE burdens may be incurred by insects in contact with current-use and 
      derelict treated polymers within human spaces and solid waste disposal sites (e.g. 
      landfills, automotive dumps, etc.). Once ingested, even burdens not absorbed across 
      the gut wall may be dispersed within proximate terrestrial food webs via the 
      insect's movements and/or predation.

AB  - We assessed the bioavailability of Ag from Ag nanoparticles (NPs), stabilized with 
      polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), to terrestrial isopods which were exposed to 10, 100 and 
      1000 μg Ag NPs/g of dry food. Different Ag species were determined in the NP 
      suspension that was fed to isopods: (i) total Ag by atomic absorption spectroscopy, 
      (ii) the sum of Ag-PVP complexes and free Ag(+) by anodic stripping voltammetry at 
      the bismuth-film electrode, and (iii) free Ag(+) by ion-selective potentiometry. The 
      amounts of Ag species in the consumed food were compared to the masses of Ag 
      accumulated in the isopod digestive glands. Our results show that all three Ag 
      species (Ag NPs, Ag-PVP complexes and free Ag(+)) could be the source of 
      bioaccumulated Ag, but to various degrees depending on the exposure concentration 
      and transformations in the digestive system. We provide a proof that (i) Ag NPs 
      dissolve and Ag-PVP complexes dissociate in the isopod digestive tract; (ii) the 
      concentration of free Ag(+) in the suspension offered to the test organisms is not 
      the only measure of bioavailable Ag. The type of NP stabilizer along with the NP 
      transformations in the digestive system needs to be considered in the creation of 
      new computational models of the nanomaterial fate.

AB  - The versatile use of various synthetic polymers, including plastics, generates a 
      large volume of non-degradable waste, which is eventually responsible for forming 
      microplastics (MPs) in aquatic environments. The present study describes the 
      significant spatial and seasonal variation on the abundance of MPs and their 
      physiochemical nature along the Mandovi-Zuari estuarine system of Goa, west coast of 
      India. During the wet season (September), the average abundance of MPs was found 
      relatively higher in water (0.107 particles/m(3)) and sediment (7314 particles/kg) 
      than those found in the dry season (April) (0.099 particles/m(3) in water and 4873 
      particles/kg in sediment). During the wet season, heavy rain and excessive riverine 
      freshwater influx carry more terrestrial plastic debris in the estuarine system 
      which causes higher averages MPs density in surface water and sediment. <300 μm 
      sized particles and black colored MPs were predominant equally in water and sediment 
      during both seasons. MPs of different shapes like fragments, fibres, films and beads 
      accounted for most collected samples. The Micro-Fourier Transform Infrared 
      Spectroscopy (μ-FTIR) based compositional analysis identified approximately 33 types 
      of polymers, of which polyacrylamide (PAM), polyacetylene, polyamide (PA), polyvinyl 
      pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyimide (PI) were abundant. 
      Fragmentation of larger plastic particles due to mismanaged treated and untreated 
      STPs and washing machine effluents are the primary sources of these MPs in the 
      estuarine system. Moreover, these estuaries also receive a variety of domestic, 
      industrial and other wastes from local cities, ports, and fishing jetties. Thus the 
      present study enlightens the current distribution of MPs and their sources in the 
      Mandovi-Zuari estuarine system and thus provides very useful information to the 
      stakeholder and concerned departments for initiating the mitigation measures.

TI  - Rapid transcriptome responses of maize (Zea mays) to UV-B in irradiated and shielded 
      tissues.
PG  - R16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depletion of stratospheric ozone has raised terrestrial levels of 
      ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B), an environmental change linked to an increased risk 
      of skin cancer and with potentially deleterious consequences for plants. To better 
      understand the processes of UV-B acclimation that result in altered plant morphology 
      and physiology, we investigated gene expression in different organs of maize at 
      several UV-B fluence rates and exposure times. RESULTS: Microarray hybridization was 
      used to assess UV-B responses in directly exposed maize organs and organs shielded 
      by a plastic that absorbs UV-B. After 8 hours of high UV-B, the abundance of 347 
      transcripts was altered: 285 were increased significantly in at least one organ and 
      80 were downregulated. More transcript changes occurred in directly exposed than in 
      shielded organs, and the levels of more transcripts were changed in adult compared 
      to seedling tissues. The time course of transcript abundance changes indicated that 
      the response kinetics to UV-B is very rapid, as some transcript levels were altered 
      within 1 hour of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the UV-B regulated genes are 
      organ-specific. Because shielded tissues, including roots, immature ears, and 
      leaves, displayed altered transcriptome profiles after exposure of the plant to 
      UV-B, some signal(s) must be transmitted from irradiated to shielded tissues. These 
      results indicate that there are integrated responses to UV-B radiation above normal 
      levels. As the same total UV-B irradiation dose applied at three intensities 
      elicited different transcript profiles, the transcriptome changes exhibit threshold 
      effects rather than a reciprocal dose-effect response. Transcriptome profiling 
      highlights possible signaling pathways and molecules for future research.

AB  - This note reports data about a heterogeneous assemblage of anthropogenic litter 
      recorded in 307 nesting and roosting sites of Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) 
      from a small Mediterranean island. I obtained items of anthropogenic litter on > 30% 
      on the total, with plastic, glass and paper the significantly more abundant litter 
      categories. Litter items were found in the nests mainly as a dry remnant in the 
      regurgitated pellets. Fragments of expanded polystyrene (EPS) with peck marks were 
      also recorded, these last transported to the nests because of their resemblance to 
      the cuttlebones of the Sepia cuttlefish. Ingestion of this litter and the pecking on 
      EPS can negatively impact on seabirds. Moreover, the presence of this litter 
      highlights a transport of polluting material even at considerable distance from 
      anthropized areas. Finally, the presence of scavenger species (an endemic lizard and 
      terrestrial molluscs) feeding on food remains could suggest an assimilation of 
      litter into the trophic webs.

PG  - 5493-500
LID - 10.1021/es404996b [doi]
AB  - To assess the environmental behavior and impact of graphene oxide (GO) on living 
      organisms more accurately, the aggregation of GO and its deposition on Al2O3 
      particles were systematically investigated using batch experiments across a wide 
      range of solution chemistries. The results indicated that the aggregation of GO and 
      its deposition on Al2O3 depended on the solution pH and the types and concentrations 
      of electrolytes. MgCl2 and CaCl2 destabilized GO because of their effective charge 
      screening and neutralization, and the presence of NaH2PO4 and poly(acrylic acid) 
      (PAA) improved the stability of GO with the increase in pH values as a result of 
      electrostatic interactions and steric repulsion. Specifically, the dissolution of 
      Al2O3 contributed to GO aggregation at relatively low pH or high pH values. Results 
      from this study provide critical information for predicting the fate of GO in 
      aquatic-terrestrial transition zones, where aluminum (hydro)oxides are present.

TI  - Global Plastic Pollution Observation System to Aid Policy.
PG  - 7770-7775
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c00818 [doi]
AB  - Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges and 
      has received commensurate widespread attention. Although it is a top priority for 
      policymakers and scientists alike, the knowledge required to guide decisions, 
      implement mitigation actions, and assess their outcomes remains inadequate. We argue 
      that an integrated, global monitoring system for plastic pollution is needed to 
      provide comprehensive, harmonized data for environmental, societal, and economic 
      assessments. The initial focus on marine ecosystems has been expanded here to 
      include atmospheric transport and terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. An 
      earth-system-level plastic observation system is proposed as a hub for collecting 
      and assessing the scale and impacts of plastic pollution across a wide array of 
      particle sizes and ecosystems including air, land, water, and biota and to monitor 
      progress toward ameliorating this problem. The proposed observation system strives 
      to integrate new information and to identify pollution hotspots (i.e., production 
      facilities, cities, roads, ports, etc.) and expands monitoring from marine 
      environments to encompass all ecosystem types. Eventually, such a system will 
      deliver knowledge to support public policy and corporate contributions to the 
      relevant United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

TI  - [Correlation Between Microplastics Pollution and Eutrophication in the Near Shore 
      Waters of Dianchi Lake].

AB  - Microplastics have been found in many environmental media such as sea water, coastal 
      tidal flats, terrestrial water, sediments, and organisms. Microplastics pollution in 
      inland freshwater lakes have received extensive attention; however, the correlation 
      between eutrophication and microplastics pollution in freshwater lakes remains 
      unclear. In this study, 24 sampling sites were set up in the near shore surface 
      waters of Dianchi Lake, and the pollution characteristics of microplastics such as 
      abundance, composition, particle size, color, and form were evaluated. Water quality 
      parameters related to eutrophication state were analyzed, and the eutrophication 
      indices were further calculated. Specifically, sample pre-treatment was conducted 
      according to the method issued by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
      (NOAA) of the United States. The color and morphological characteristics of 
      microplastic samples were observed using a stereoscopic microscope, and counts and 
      particle size measurements were performed using Nano Measure 1.2 software. Parts of 
      the samples were selected, and the polymer composition analysis was performed using 
      micro-Fourier Transform infrared (μ-FTIR) spectroscopy. The indices related to 
      eutrophication level evaluation were tested according to the experimental standard 
      methods issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China. The results 
      showed that the abundance of microplastics in the near shore waters of Dianchi Lake 
      was between 800 and 6000 n·m(-3), with an average value of 2867 n·m(-3). The types 
      of polymers detected were polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyetherurethane (PEU), 
      polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), respectively. 
      The diameter proportion of microplastics in the range of 0.2-0.5 mm was the highest. 
      Fiber microplastics accounted for the most observed type, followed by fragments and 
      films. Among the 24 monitoring sites, it was found that proportions of severe, 
      moderate, and mild eutrophication and mesotrophication sites accounted for 8.33%, 
      58.33%, 29.17%, and 4.17% of the total sampling sites, respectively, and the main 
      pollutant was total nitrogen (TN). Microplastics abundances in the near shore waters 
      of Dianchi Lake were significantly positively correlated with TN concentrations 
      (P<0.01), whereas they were negatively correlated with chlorophyll 
      a(Chl-a)concentrations, not reaching a significant level (P>0.05). The microplastics 
      abundance and TN concentrations in the north bank water near the main urban area of 
      Kunming were significantly higher than those in the other three banks. Microplastics 
      and TN were considered to potentially have the same origin and be attributed to the 
      tail water discharge from WWTPs.

TI  - Metabolic fingerprinting of the responses to salinity in the invasive ground beetle 
      Merizodus soledadinus at the Kerguelen Islands.

AB  - Salinity is an abiotic factor that may impact survival and fitness of terrestrial 
      insects in coastal environments. Meanwhile, some terrestrial arthropods can survive 
      in hypersaline environments, and counterbalance osmotic stress by intra- and 
      extracellular buildups of organic osmolytes. The ground beetle Merizodus soledadinus 
      originates from South America and it is distributed in forests and riparian zones, 
      where salinity levels are considerably low. This species has been introduced at the 
      Kerguelen Islands a century ago, where it colonized coastal areas (tide drift 
      lines), and must thus withstand salinity variations due to tide, spray, and organic 
      matter deposited therein. In the present study, we addressed the physiological 
      plasticity of M. soledadinus to saline conditions, by monitoring body water content 
      and survival in adults experimentally subjected to different salinities. We also 
      investigated possible metabolic adjustments involved at three contrasted salinity 
      levels (0‰, 35‰, 70‰) at 4 and 8°C. We hypothesized that this invasive ground beetle 
      can withstand a broad range of salinity conditions thanks to the plastic 
      accumulation of compatible solutes. The study revealed a progressive drop in body 
      water content in individuals exposed to 35‰ and 70‰, as opposed to the controls. 
      Metabolic fingerprints showed compatible solute (erythritol, alanine, glycine and 
      proline) accumulation at medium and high salinity conditions (35‰ and 70‰). We 
      concluded that the osmo-induced accumulation of amino acids and polyols was likely 
      to modulate the ground beetles' body water balance on medium saline substrates, thus 
      enhancing their survival ability.

AB  - Microplastics are small (<5 mm) fragments of plastic debris that are ubiquitous in 
      oceans and terrestrial ecosystems. Studies on microplastics in sediment and soil 
      matrices are particularly challenging because of the need to separate the plastics 
      from the sediments. We investigated the efficiencies of 18 combinations of six 
      extracting solutions (ESs) (oil, water, oil-in-water, NaCl, oil-in-NaCl, and NaI) 
      and three isolation methods (IMs) (hand stirring, centrifugation, and aeration) for 
      fine and coarse sediments, with low and high density polymers. IMs did not affect 
      the extraction efficiency. Except in case of oil, all ESs enabled good extraction 
      (84 ± 17%) of light polymers (PE and PE-ABS). NaI presented the best extraction 
      efficiency (71 ± 17%) for the densest polymers (PET, PES, and PA). For these ESs, 
      fibers were extracted at a lower efficiency than pellets and fragments, and sediment 
      gran size did not affect the extraction. For other ESs, mean extraction rates ranged 
      from 5% to 48%. Overall, the extraction efficiencies were lower than those found in 
      the literature, despite repeating the separation process three times. The collection 
      of floating materials remained a problem, as plastics tended to adhere to the glass 
      wall. Our work will help the comparability between previous and future monitoring 
      results and the selection of the most suitable protocols for future studies. This 
      work clearly demonstrates also that there is no robust protocol for extracting all 
      types and forms of microplastics from fine sediments and that research efforts to 
      arrive at a reliable method remain by taking account the interaction of MPs with 
      other particles as well as the electrostatic properties of MP.

TI  - Potential for plastics to transport hydrophobic contaminants.
PG  - 7759-64
AB  - Plastic debris litters marine and terrestrial habitats worldwide. It is ingested by 
      numerous species of animals, causing deleterious physical effects. High 
      concentrations of hydrophobic organic contaminants have also been measured on 
      plastic debris collected from the environment, but the fate of these contaminants is 
      poorly understood. Here, we examine the uptake and subsequent release of 
      phenanthrene by three plastics. Equilibrium distribution coefficients for sorption 
      of phenanthrene from seawater onto the plastics varied by more than an order of 
      magnitude (polyethylene >> polypropylene > polyvinyl chloride (PVC)). In all cases, 
      sorption to plastics greatly exceeded sorption to two natural sediments. Desorption 
      rates of phenanthrene from the plastics or sediments back into solution spanned 
      several orders of magnitude. As expected, desorption occurred more rapidly from the 
      sediments than from the plastics. Using the equilibrium partitioning method, the 
      effects of adding very small quantities of plastic with sorbed phenanthrene to 
      sediment inhabited by the lugworm (Arenicola marina) were evaluated. We estimate 
      that the addition of as little as 1 microg of contaminated polyethylene to a gram of 
      sediment would give a significant increase in phenanthrene accumulation by A. 
      marina. Thus, plastics may be important agents in the transport of hydrophobic 
      contaminants to sediment-dwelling organisms.

TI  - Mapping of QTLs for lateral root branching and length in maize (Zea mays L.) under 
      differential phosphorus supply.
PG  - 688-95
AB  - Low phosphorus availability is a primary constraint for plant growth in terrestrial 
      ecosystems. Lateral root initiation and elongation may play an important role in the 
      uptake of immobile nutrients such as phosphorus by increasing soil exploration and 
      phosphorus acquisition. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative 
      trait loci (QTLs) controlling lateral root length (LRL), number (LRN), and 
      plasticity of the primary seedling root of maize under varying phosphorus 
      availability. Using a cigar roll culture in a controlled environment, we evaluated 
      primary root LRL and LRN at low and high phosphorus availability in 160 recombinant 
      inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between maize genotypes B73 and Mo17, which 
      have contrasting adaptation to low phosphorus availability in the field. Low 
      phosphorus availability increased LRL by 19% in Mo17, the phosphorus-efficient 
      parent, but significantly decreased LRL in B73, the phosphorus-inefficient genotype. 
      Substantial genetic variation and transgressive segregation for LRL and LRN existed 
      in the population. The plasticity of LRL ranged from -100% to 146.3%, with a mean of 
      30.4%, and the plasticity of LRN ranged from -82.2% to 164.1%, with a mean of 18.5%. 
      On the basis of composite interval mapping with a LOD threshold of 3.27, one QTL was 
      associated with LRN plasticity, five QTLs were associated with LRL and one QTL was 
      associated with LRN under high fertility. Under low fertility, six QTLs were 
      associated with LRL and one QTL with LRN. No QTLs were detected for plasticity of 
      LRL. A number of RILs exceeded Mo17, the phosphorus-efficient parent, for LRL, LRN, 
      and plasticity. The detection of QTLs for these traits, in combination with the 
      observation of transgressive segregants in our population, indicates that favorable 
      alleles can be combined to increase seedling lateral root growth in maize.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity of climbing-related traits in the ankle joint of great apes 
      and rainforest hunter-gatherers.
PG  - 309-28
AB  - The "negrito" and African "pygmy" phenotypes are predominately exhibited by 
      hunter-gatherers living in rainforest habitats. Foraging within such habitats is 
      associated with a unique set of locomotor behaviors, most notably habitual vertical 
      climbing during the pursuit of honey, fruit, and game. When performed frequently, 
      this behavior is expected to correlate with developmentally plastic skeletal 
      morphologies that respond to mechanical loading. Using six measurements in the 
      distal tibia and talus that discriminate nonhuman primates by vertical climbing 
      frequency, we tested the prediction that intraspecific variation in this behavior is 
      reflected in the morphology of the ankle joint of habitually climbing human 
      populations. First, to explore the plasticity of climbing-linked morphologies, we 
      made comparisons between chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans from wild and captive 
      settings. The analysis revealed significant differences in two climbing-linked 
      traits (anterior expansion of the articular surface of the distal tibia and 
      increased degree of talar wedging), indicating that these traits are sensitive to 
      climbing behavior. However, our analyses did not reveal any signatures of climbing 
      behavior in the ankles of habitually climbing hunter-gatherers. These results 
      suggest that the detection of fine-grained differences in human locomotor behaviors 
      at the ankle joint, particularly those associated with arboreality, may be obscured 
      by the functional demands of terrestrial bipedalism. Accordingly, it may be 
      difficult to use population-level characteristics of ankle morphology to make 
      inferences about the climbing behavior of hominins in the fossil record, even when 
      facultative arborealism is associated with key fitness benefits.

AB  - Living tetrapods owe their existence to a critical moment 360-340 million years ago 
      when their ancestors walked on land. Vertebrae are central to locomotion, yet 
      systematic testing of correlations between vertebral form and terrestriality and 
      subsequent reinvasions of aquatic habitats is lacking, obscuring our understanding 
      of movement capabilities in early tetrapods. Here, we quantified vertebral shape 
      across a diverse group of Paleozoic amphibians (Temnospondyli) encompassing 
      different habitats and nearly the full range of early tetrapod vertebral shapes. We 
      demonstrate that temnospondyls were likely ancestrally terrestrial and had several 
      early reinvasions of aquatic habitats. We find a greater diversity in temnospondyl 
      vertebrae than previously known. We also overturn long-held hypotheses centered on 
      weight-bearing, showing that neural arch features, including muscle attachment, were 
      plastic across the water-land divide and do not provide a clear signal of habitat 
      preferences. In contrast, intercentra traits were critical, with temnospondyls 
      repeatedly converging on distinct forms in terrestrial and aquatic taxa, with little 
      overlap between. Through our geometric morphometric study, we have been able to 
      document associations between vertebral shape and environmental preferences in 
      Paleozoic tetrapods and to reveal morphological constraints imposed by vertebrae to 
      locomotion, independent of ancestry.

AB  - Most ectothermic organisms mature at smaller body sizes when reared in warmer 
      conditions. This phenotypically plastic response, known as the "temperature-size 
      rule" (TSR), is one of the most taxonomically widespread patterns in biology. 
      However, the TSR remains a longstanding life-history puzzle for which no dominant 
      driver has been found. We propose that oxygen supply plays a central role in 
      explaining the magnitude of ectothermic temperature-size responses. Given the much 
      lower oxygen availability and greater effort required to increase uptake in water 
      vs. air, we predict that the TSR in aquatic organisms, especially larger species 
      with lower surface area-body mass ratios, will be stronger than in terrestrial 
      organisms. We performed a meta-analysis of 1,890 body mass responses to temperature 
      in controlled experiments on 169 terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species. This 
      reveals that the strength of the temperature-size response is greater in aquatic 
      than terrestrial species. In animal species of ∼100 mg dry mass, the 
      temperature-size response of aquatic organisms is 10 times greater than in 
      terrestrial organisms (-5.0% °C(-1) vs. -0.5% °C(-1)). Moreover, although the size 
      response of small (<0.1 mg dry mass) aquatic and terrestrial species is similar, 
      increases in species size cause the response to become increasingly negative in 
      aquatic species, as predicted, but on average less negative in terrestrial species. 
      These results support oxygen as a major driver of temperature-size responses in 
      aquatic organisms. Further, the environment-dependent differences parallel 
      latitudinal body size clines, and will influence predicted impacts of climate 
      warming on food production, community structure, and food-web dynamics.

AB  - Glyphosate and microplastics are widely found in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater 
      environments due to their globally widespread application. Further, they have proved 
      to have specific ecotoxicity effects on aquatic plants. However, few studies have 
      focused on the effects of small plastic particles and glyphosate, or especially, 
      their combined effect on vascular plants in freshwater ecosystems. This study aimed 
      to conduct a simulated greenhouse experiment to investigate the ecotoxicity of 
      polystyrene microplastics and glyphosate on the floating plant Salvinia cucullata by 
      exposure to fluorescent polystyrene microplastics (1 μm; concentration, 3, 15, and 
      75 mg/L), glyphosate (5, 25, and 50 mg/L), and a mixture of the two (3 + 5, 15 + 25, 
      and 75 + 50 mg/L) for seven days. Glyphosate significantly reduced the relative 
      growth rate, photosynthetic capacity, and root activity of S. cucullata. Polystyrene 
      microplastics did not significantly influence photosynthesis or leaf morphological 
      characteristics but they significantly reduced relative growth rate and root 
      activity in S. cucullata, indicating that the effects of microplastics on aquatic 
      plants are potentially associated with different organs exposed to pollution. 
      Polystyrene microplastics and glyphosate activated the plant antioxidant defense 
      systems by increasing antioxidative enzyme activities including, superoxide 
      dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase to cope with oxidative stress. 
      Synergistic effects (only observed in percent leaf yellowing) were observed when 
      S. cucullata was exposed to a high concentrations (≥15 + 25 mg/L) of glyphosate and 
      microplastics. Our results indicate that pervasive microplastics and herbicide 
      contamination in freshwater may potentially affect the growth of aquatic plants.

TI  - [Effects of lower limit of subsurface drip irrigation on tomato growth and its yield 
      in plastic tunnel].
PG  - 767-71
AB  - A subsurface drip irrigation experiment was conducted in a plastic tunnel to study 
      the effects of different lower limits of subsurface drip irrigation on tomato growth 
      and its yield. The lower limits of subsurface drip irrigation were expressed by soil 
      water suctions detected by tensiometers placed in 30 cm soil layer. The designed 
      values of soil water suction in this experiment were 10, 16, 25, 40 and 63 kPa, 
      respectively. The results showed that the height and biomass of tomato plant 
      decreased significantly with increasing lower limits of subsurface drip irrigation. 
      Parabolic regression curves were suitable to simulate the relationships of stem 
      diameter of tomato plant, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) with lower limits of 
      subsurface drip irrigation. The relationship between the ratio of stem diameter to 
      plant height of tomato and lower limit could be simulated by three-dimensional 
      multinomial regression curve. The growth of tomato root and shoot and their ratio 
      R/S) varied under different lowerlimits of subsurface drip irrigation. The tomato 
      plant grew well, RI/S was favorable, and the yield and WUE were higher when soil 
      water suction was in the range of 25- 33 kPa. When this range was served as the 
      criteria for subsurface drip irrigation, the soil water content at the beginning of 
      irrigation should be lower, and the irrigation frequency should be fewer than that 
      of conventional irrigation. This range of soil water suction was in favor of 
      improving the WUE and decreasing labor cost for tomato cultivation in plastic 
      tunnel.

AB  - Although we are witnesses of an increase in the number of studies examining the 
      exposure/effects of microplastics (MPs) on different organisms, there are many 
      unknowns. This review aims to: (i) analyze current studies devoted to investigating 
      the exposure/effects of MPs on animals; (ii) provide some basic knowledge about 
      different model organisms and experimental approaches used in studying MPs; and to 
      (iii) convey directions for future studies. We have summarized data from 500 studies 
      published from January 2011 to May 2020, about different aspects of model organisms 
      (taxonomic group of organisms, type of ecosystem they inhabit, life-stage, sex, 
      tissue and/or organ) and experimental design (laboratory/field, 
      ingestion/bioaccumulation/effect). We also discuss and try to encourage 
      investigation of some less studied organisms (terrestrial and freshwater species, 
      among groups including Annelida, Nematoda, Echinodermata, Cnidaria, Rotifera, birds, 
      amphibians, reptiles), and aspects of MP pollution (long-term field studies, 
      comparative studies examining life stages, sexes, laboratory and field work). We 
      hope that the information presented in this review will serve as a good starting 
      point and will provide useful guidelines for researchers during the process of 
      deciding on the model organism and study designs for investigating MPs.

TI  - Preparation of desiccation-resistant aquatic-living Nostoc flagelliforme 
      (Cyanophyceae) for potential ecological application.
PG  - 1006-12
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.12279 [doi]
AB  - Nostoc flagelliforme is a terrestrial edible cyanobacterium that grows in arid and 
      semi-arid steppes. The continued over-exploitation in the last century has led to a 
      sharp decline of this resource and a severe deterioration of the steppe ecology. 
      Liquid-cultured N. flagelliforme serves as promising algal 'seeds' for resource 
      restoration. In this study, macroscopic (or visible) aquatic-living colonies (MaACs) 
      of N. flagelliforme were developed under weak light and high nitrogen conditions. In 
      a 24 day shake-flask culture, MaACs were propagated by about 4.5-fold in biomass 
      without loss of their macro-morphology; at the same time, the addition of weak UV-B 
      treatment resulted in slightly bigger MaACs. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) k30, a 
      water-soluble polymer, was used to generate the coating around MaACs, and after full 
      desiccation, the coated MaACs could recover their photosynthetic physiological 
      activity when rehydrated, with 4% PVP k30 for coating being most effective. In 
      contrast, PVP k30-coated microscopic aquatic-living colonies of N. flagelliforme and 
      non-coated MaACs showed no resistance to full desiccation. The macroscopic 
      morphology or structure of MaACs should be crucial for the formation of protection 
      by PVP k30 coating. PVP k30-coated MaACs were more approaching to actual application 
      for resource restoration.

TI  - Removal of dissolved brown algal phlorotannins using insoluble 
      polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP).
PG  - 1899-910
AB  - Tannins, a large and diverse group of phenolic secondary metabolites, are common in 
      terrestrial plants and marine brown algae. It is sometimes desirable to remove the 
      tannins from plant or algal extracts, e.g., when isolating enzymes and nucleic 
      acids, when using certain colorimetric methods to quantify the tannin content, or to 
      create reliable controls when using tannins in experimental studies. Insoluble 
      polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) can be used to specifically remove tannins from 
      solution. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of different factors (amount 
      of PVPP, number of PVPP treatments, type of solvent, pH, and incubation time) on the 
      PVPP removal of dissolved brown algal phlorotannins. Our results imply that there is 
      a limited amount of phlorotannins that can bind to a given amount of PVPP, and that 
      it is preferable to use low quantities of PVPP repeatedly, compared to using fewer 
      treatments with a high amount of PVPP. Furthermore, we found no consistent effect on 
      the removal of phlorotannins due to solvent type (acetone, methanol, distilled water 
      or filtered seawater). There was a slight decrease in the amount of phlorotannins 
      removed from extracts with increasing pH when repeatedly treated with PVPP. All 
      phlorotannins were removed from extracts with pH < or = 6.2, and 89% of the initial 
      phlorotannin content was removed at pH 9.7. These results are compared with previous 
      methodological studies on tannin removal with PVPP. Furthermore, the implications of 
      phlorotannin removal in analytical and ecological investigations are discussed.

TI  - Biological degradation of PVA/CH blends in terrestrial and aquatic conditions.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - A new material, the water soluble blend of poly-vinyl alcohol and collagen 
      hydrolysate (PVA/CH) was developed in Slovakia. Results from a recent biodegradation 
      study including three blend variants differing in the collagen content are 
      presented. Two different biodegradation tests, one in compost environment, the other 
      at aquatic conditions and additional compost analysis after degradation of the 
      polymer have been done. Degradation rates were determined for both test systems and 
      the carbon conversion rates were calculated by drawing up a carbon balance out of 
      the aquatic test. The results proofed positive influence of collagen hydrolysate on 
      degradation but also show a relatively low biological degradability of PVA under the 
      applied test conditions. At least, no negative influence on the compost composition 
      was detected.

TI  - What to eat now? Shifts in polar bear diet during the ice-free season in western 
      Hudson Bay.
PG  - 3509-23
LID - 10.1002/ece3.740 [doi]
AB  - Under current climate trends, spring ice breakup in Hudson Bay is advancing rapidly, 
      leaving polar bears (Ursus maritimus) less time to hunt seals during the spring when 
      they accumulate the majority of their annual fat reserves. For this reason, foods 
      that polar bears consume during the ice-free season may become increasingly 
      important in alleviating nutritional stress from lost seal hunting opportunities. 
      Defining how the terrestrial diet might have changed since the onset of rapid 
      climate change is an important step in understanding how polar bears may be reacting 
      to climate change. We characterized the current terrestrial diet of polar bears in 
      western Hudson Bay by evaluating the contents of passively sampled scat and 
      comparing it to a similar study conducted 40 years ago. While the two terrestrial 
      diets broadly overlap, polar bears currently appear to be exploiting increasingly 
      abundant resources such as caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and snow geese (Chen 
      caerulescens caerulescens) and newly available resources such as eggs. This 
      opportunistic shift is similar to the diet mixing strategy common among other Arctic 
      predators and bear species. We discuss whether the observed diet shift is solely a 
      response to a nutritional stress or is an expression of plastic foraging behavior.

TI  - Cellular mechanisms of behavioral plasticity in terrestrial snail.
PG  - 597-630
AB  - Functional organization of networks underlying withdrawal, feeding, and respiration 
      in terrestrial gastropod snail Helix are described. Tracking the changes during 
      non-associative and associative modifications of behavior, analysis of plasticity 
      mechanisms in identified neurons involved in these networks allowed to formulate 
      several conceptual principles which are not widely accepted. The review will present 
      data underlying the following principles: 1. Command neuron concept can be applied 
      only to all-or-none behavior. 2. Habituation is an active down-regulation process 
      opposite to up-regulating sensitization. All long-term behavioral changes at least 
      in part are associative. 3. Reinforcement is a motivational state mediated by 
      neuromodulatory neurons and can be produced by activity of a single modulatory 
      neuron. 4. Non-addressed ('soft-wired') neuromodulatory influences are necessary for 
      acquisition of memory, while retention of memory depends mostly on 'hard-wired' 
      local changes in synaptic connectivity. 5. Retrieval of declarative (sensory) and 
      procedural (motor) memory involves different functional classes of neurons.

TI  - Evaluation of a sticky trap (AedesTraP), made from disposable plastic bottles, as a 
      monitoring tool for Aedes aegypti populations.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1186/1756-3305-5-195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue virus, which is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is the 
      most important emerging viral disease, infecting more than 50 million people 
      annually. Currently used sticky traps are useful tools for monitoring and control of 
      A. aegypti, despite differences in efficiency, labor requirements and cost. In the 
      present work, a field assay was carried out to evaluate the performance of a sticky 
      trap (AedesTrap), produced using disposable material, in capturing gravid Aedes spp. 
      females. Additionally, conditions necessary for the improved performance of the 
      device, such as number of traps per site and location (indoors or outdoors) were 
      evaluated. METHODS: During a one year period, traps were placed in a dengue endemic 
      area in 28 day cycles. The trap, named AedesTrap, consisted of a disposable plastic 
      soda bottle coated inside with colophony resin, which served as a sticky substrate. 
      Disposable bottles were donated by restaurants, and traps were made by laboratory 
      staff, reducing the cost of the sticky trap (less than U$3). Mosquito capture in 
      indoor and outdoor areas was compared by placing the traps in laundry room, kitchen 
      or bedroom (indoors) and front or back yard (outdoors). The relationship between the 
      number of AedesTraps and quantity of captured mosquitoes was investigated by 
      utilizing one or three traps/site. RESULTS: During a 28 day cycle, a single 
      AedesTrap was capable of capturing up to 15 A. aegypti in a house, with a mean 
      capture of 0.5 to 2.63 females per premise. The AedesTrap collected three times more 
      outdoors versus indoors. Similarly, the capability of detecting Aedes spp. 
      infestation, and of capturing females, was three times higher when using three 
      AedesTraps per house, compared with one trap per house. CONCLUSIONS: AedesTrap was 
      shown to be capable of capturing A. aegypti and other culicidae, providing 
      information on the adult mosquito population, and allowing the identification of 
      areas critically infested by mosquitoes. Low requirements for skilled labor together 
      with easy maintenance and low cost are additional advantages of using this sticky 
      trap.

AB  - The ability to adaptively alter morphological, anatomical, or physiological 
      functional traits to local environmental variations using external environmental 
      cues is especially well expressed by all terrestrial and most aquatic plants. A 
      ubiquitous cue eliciting these plastic phenotypic responses is mechanical 
      perturbation (MP), which can evoke dramatic differences in the size, shape, or 
      mechanical properties of conspecifics. Current thinking posits that MP is part of a 
      very ancient "stress-perception response system" that involves receptors located at 
      the cell membrane/cell wall interface capable of responding to a broad spectrum of 
      stress-inducing factors. This hypothesis is explored here from the perspective of 
      cell wall evolution and the control of cell wall architecture by unicellular and 
      multicellular plants. Among the conclusions that emerge from this exploration is the 
      perspective that the plant cell is phenotypically plastic.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial ecosystems have attracted increasing attention 
      all over the world. The adsorption-desorption behavior and bioavailability of metals 
      in soil would affect its toxicity to organisms. However, the influences of MPs on 
      adsorption-desorption behavior between metals and soil as well as bioavailability of 
      metals in soils are scarcely investigated. Herein, different percentage (0, 0.1%, 
      1%, 10%) of polyethylene-microplastic (PE-MP) were thoroughly mixed into the soil to 
      investigate the impacts of PE-MP on adsorption-desorption and bioavailability of 
      metals (Zn(2+), Pb(2+)) in the soil. A series of characterization were carried out 
      to determine the change of PE-MP before and after adsorption to investigate the 
      mechanisms. When MP100 (average size: 129 μm) content in soil increased to 10%, the 
      adsorption capacities of soil with Pb(2+) and Zn(2+) were 3.73 and 4.56 mg/g, 
      respectively, which were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of pure soil. When 
      MP300 (average size: 293 μm) content in soil increased to 10%, the extraction 
      fraction of Zn(2+) and Pb(2+) from soil by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid 
      reached 12.35% and 23.96%, respectively, which were significantly (p < 0.05) higher 
      than that of pure soil, indicating high concentration (10%) of MPs in soil would 
      decrease the adsorption capability of soil to metals and increase the mobility of 
      metals in terrestrial environment. However, when MPs content in soil was 0.1%, the 
      extraction fraction of Zn(2+) and Pb(2+) showed no significant difference with that 
      of pure soil, indicating that actual MPs in soil is unlikely to bring significant 
      influence on metal bioavailability.

AB  - Sewage effluent input and population were chosen as predictors of microplastic 
      presence in sediments at four sites in the River Thames basin (UK). Large 
      microplastic particles (1mm-4mm) were extracted using a stepwise approach to include 
      visual extraction, flotation and identification using Raman spectroscopy. 
      Microplastics were found at all four sites. One site had significantly higher 
      numbers of microplastics than other sites, average 66 particles 100g(-1), 91% of 
      which were fragments. This site was downstream of a storm drain outfall receiving 
      urban runoff; many of the fragments at this site were determined to be derived of 
      thermoplastic road-surface marking paints. At the remaining three sites, fibres were 
      the dominant particle type. The most common polymers identified included 
      polypropylene, polyester and polyarylsulphone. This study describes two major new 
      findings: presence of microplastic particles in a UK freshwater system and 
      identification of road marking paints as a source of microplastics. CAPSULE: This 
      study is the first to quantify microplastics of any size in river sediments in the 
      UK and links their presence to terrestrial sources including sewage and road marking 
      paints.

AB  - Global warming is increasing the overheating risk for many organisms, though the 
      potential for plasticity in thermal tolerance to mitigate this risk is largely 
      unknown. In part, this shortcoming stems from a lack of knowledge about global and 
      taxonomic patterns of variation in tolerance plasticity. To address this critical 
      issue, we test leading hypotheses for broad-scale variation in ectotherm tolerance 
      plasticity using a dataset that includes vertebrate and invertebrate taxa from 
      terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Contrary to expectation, plasticity in 
      heat tolerance was unrelated to latitude or thermal seasonality. However, plasticity 
      in cold tolerance is associated with thermal seasonality in some habitat types. In 
      addition, aquatic taxa have approximately twice the plasticity of terrestrial taxa. 
      Based on the observed patterns of variation in tolerance plasticity, we propose that 
      limited potential for behavioural plasticity (i.e. behavioural thermoregulation) 
      favours the evolution of greater plasticity in physiological traits, consistent with 
      the 'Bogert effect'. Finally, we find that all ectotherms have relatively low 
      acclimation in thermal tolerance and demonstrate that overheating risk will be 
      minimally reduced by acclimation in even the most plastic groups. Our analysis 
      indicates that behavioural and evolutionary mechanisms will be critical in allowing 
      ectotherms to buffer themselves from extreme temperatures.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerances in five oribatid mite species from 
      sub-Antarctic Marion Island.
PG  - 693-700
AB  - The extent to which phenotypic plasticity might mediate short-term responses to 
      environmental change is controversial. Nonetheless, theoretical work has made the 
      prediction that plasticity should be common, especially in predictably variable 
      environments by comparison with those that are either stable or unpredictable. Here 
      we examine these predictions by comparing the phenotypic plasticity of thermal 
      tolerances (supercooling point (SCP), lower lethal temperature (LLT), upper lethal 
      temperature (ULT)), following acclimation at either 0, 5, 10 or 15 degrees C, for 
      seven days, of five, closely-related ameronothroid mite species. These species 
      occupy marine and terrestrial habitats, which differ in their predictability, on 
      sub-Antarctic Marion Island. All of the species showed some evidence of pre-freeze 
      mortality (SCPs -9 to -23 degrees C; LLTs -3 to -15 degrees C), though 
      methodological effects might have contributed to the difference between the SCPs and 
      LLTs, and the species are therefore considered moderately chill tolerant. ULTs 
      varied between 36 degrees C and 41 degrees C. Acclimation effects on SCP and LLT 
      were typically stronger in the marine than in the terrestrial species, in keeping 
      with the prediction of strong acclimation responses in species from predictably 
      variable environments, but weaker responses in species from unpredictable 
      environments. The converse was found for ULT. These findings demonstrate that 
      acclimation responses vary among traits in the same species. Moreover, they suggest 
      that there is merit in assessing the predictability of changes in high and low 
      environmental temperatures separately.

TI  - Life cycle polyphenism as a factor affecting ecological divergence within 
      Notophthalmus viridescens.
PG  - 23-34
LID - 10.1007/s00442-008-1125-8 [doi]
AB  - Polyphenism, which allows a single genotype to express multiple discrete phenotypes 
      in response to environmental cues, is an adaptive trait in heterogeneous 
      environments. Pond hydroperiod is an important ecological parameter affecting 
      amphibian life history, and variation in local pond hydrology has been hypothesized 
      to play a role in species divergence via changes in polyphenism. The eastern newt 
      (Notophthalmus viridescens) expresses life cycle polyphenism. Larvae develop along 
      three possible pathways: metamorphosis to aquatic lunged adult via a terrestrial 
      juvenile (eft) stage, metamorphosis directly to an aquatic lunged adult, or 
      maturation directly to an aquatic gilled adult without metamorphosis (i.e., 
      paedomorphosis). Subspecies of N. viridescens vary in their polyphenic patterns, 
      suggesting possible adaptation to different environments. However, no studies have 
      experimentally tested how genetic and environmental components contribute to the 
      observed differences among subspecies and whether such differences may facilitate 
      divergence. We tested whether adaptation to local pond hydrology via polyphenic 
      changes existed among subspecies by rearing larvae of three subspecies (N. v. 
      dorsalis, N. v. louisianensis, and N. v. viridescens) along three hydroperiod 
      regimes (short, long, and constant) in outdoor artificial ponds. We found that 
      larval N. v. viridescens obligately metamorphosed to efts under all hydroperiods, 
      whereas N. v. dorsalis and N. v. louisianensis exhibited plasticity: larvae 
      metamorphosed to efts under drying conditions but metamorphosed directly to aquatic 
      adults or became paedomorphic in constant water. Also, N. v. viridescens 
      metamorphosed to efts faster and at a smaller body size than the other two 
      subspecies. These data suggest that subspecies of N. viridescens are adapted to 
      different pond hydroperiods, supporting the potential for polyphenism to facilitate 
      divergence. Canalizing selection for certain alternative phenotypes within a single 
      species in which other populations remain plastic may play an important role in the 
      initiation of ecological divergence.

AB  - The biofilm-producing abilities of potentially human-pathogenic serotypes of 
      Escherichia coli from the ovine reservoir were studied at different temperatures and 
      on different surfaces. A possible influence of the hydrophobicity of the bacterial 
      cells, as well as the presence of two virulence factors, the Shiga toxin-encoding 
      (Stx) bacteriophage and the eae gene, was also studied. A total of 99 E. coli 
      isolates of serotypes O26:H11, O103:H2, and O103:H25 isolated from sheep feces were 
      included. The results show that isolates of all three E. coli serotypes investigated 
      can produce biofilm on stainless steel, glass, and polystyrene at 12, 20, and 37°C. 
      There was a good general correlation between the results obtained on the different 
      surfaces. E. coli O103:H2 isolates produced much more biofilm than those of the 
      other two serotypes at all three temperatures. In addition, isolates of serotype 
      O26:H11 produced more biofilm than those of O103:H25 at 37°C. The hydrophobicity of 
      the isolates varied between serotypes and was also influenced by temperature. The 
      results strongly indicated that hydrophobicity influenced the attachment of the 
      bacteria rather than their ability to form biofilm once attached. Isolates with the 
      eae gene produced less biofilm at 37°C than isolates without this gene. The presence 
      of a Stx bacteriophage did not influence biofilm production. In conclusion, our 
      results show that potentially human-pathogenic E. coli from the ovine reservoir can 
      form biofilm on various surfaces and at several temperatures relevant for food 
      production and handling.

AB  - Methylmercury concentrations vary widely across geographic space and among habitat 
      types, with marine and aquatic-feeding organisms typically exhibiting higher mercury 
      concentrations than terrestrial-feeding organisms. However, there are few model 
      organisms to directly compare mercury concentrations as a result of foraging in 
      marine, estuarine, or terrestrial food webs. The ecological impacts of differential 
      foraging may be especially important for generalist species that exhibit high 
      plasticity in foraging habitats, locations, or diet. Here, we investigate whether 
      foraging habitat, sex, or fidelity to a foraging area impact blood mercury 
      concentrations in western gulls (Larus occidentalis) from three colonies on the US 
      west coast. Cluster analyses showed that nearly 70% of western gulls foraged 
      primarily in ocean or coastal habitats, whereas the remaining gulls foraged in 
      terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Gulls that foraged in ocean or coastal habitats 
      for half or more of their foraging locations had 55% higher mercury concentrations 
      than gulls that forage in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Ocean-foraging gulls 
      also had lower fidelity to a specific foraging area than freshwater and 
      terrestrial-foraging gulls, but fidelity and sex were unrelated to gull blood 
      mercury concentrations in all models. These findings support existing research that 
      has described elevated mercury levels in species using aquatic habitats. Our 
      analyses also demonstrate that gulls can be used to detect differences in 
      contaminant exposure over broad geographic scales and across coarse habitat types, a 
      factor that may influence gull health and persistence of other populations that 
      forage across the land-sea gradient.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity and interpopulation differences in life history traits of 
      Armadillidium vulgare (Isopoda:Oniscidae).
PG  - 85-9
AB  - The hypothesis that the balance of trade-offs between survivorship, growth and 
      reproductive allocation in the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare will change 
      when resource input is increased has been investigated experimentally. When the 
      quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from 
      herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, 
      survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 
      168%. Growth rates increased by 99% but reproductive allocation by only 21%. In the 
      field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more 
      than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. 
      The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions 
      from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less 
      available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable 
      for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature 
      fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. 
      When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory 
      conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment 
      survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an 
      excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow 
      more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with 
      higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have 
      occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and 
      reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer 
      prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for 
      reproduction takes longer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plastic pollution affects all ecosystems, and detrimental effects to 
      animals have been reported in a growing number of studies. However, there is a 
      paucity of evidence for effects on terrestrial animals in comparison to those in the 
      marine realm. METHODS: We used the fly Drosophila melanogaster to study the effects 
      that exposure to plastics may have on life history traits and immune response. We 
      reared flies in four conditions: In media containing 1% virgin polyethylene, with no 
      chemical additives; in media supplemented with 1% or 4% polyvinyl chloride, known to 
      have a high content of added chemicals; and control flies in non-supplemented media. 
      Plastic particle size ranged from 23-500 µm. We studied fly survival to viral 
      infection, the length of the larval and pupal stage, sex ratios, fertility and the 
      size of the resultant adult flies. We then performed crossings of F1 flies in 
      non-supplemented media and looked at the life history traits of the F2. RESULTS: 
      Flies treated with plastics in the food media showed changes in fertility and sex 
      ratio, but showed no differences in developmental times, adult size or the capacity 
      to fight infections in comparison with controls. However, the offspring of treated 
      flies reared in non-supplemented food had shorter life cycles, and those coming from 
      both polyvinyl chloride treatments were smaller than those offspring of controls.

AB  - Colloidal retention characteristics, recovery and size distribution of model 
      macromolecules and natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) were systematically 
      examined using an asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AFlFFF) system under 
      various membrane size cutoffs and carrier solutions. Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) 
      standards with known molecular weights (MW) were used to determine their permeation 
      and recovery rates by membranes with different nominal MW cutoffs (NMWCO) within the 
      AFlFFF system. Based on a ≥90% recovery rate for PSS standards by the AFlFFF system, 
      the actual NMWCOs were determined to be 1.9 kDa for the 0.3 kDa membrane, 2.7 kDa 
      for the 1 kDa membrane, and 33 kDa for the 10 kDa membrane, respectively. After 
      membrane calibration, natural DOM samples were analyzed with the AFlFFF system to 
      determine their colloidal size distribution and the influence from membrane NMWCOs 
      and carrier solutions. Size partitioning of DOM samples showed a predominant 
      colloidal size fraction in the <5 nm or <10 kDa size range, consistent with the size 
      characteristics of humic substances as the main terrestrial DOM component. Recovery 
      of DOM by the AFlFFF system, as determined by UV-absorbance at 254 nm, decreased 
      significantly with increasing membrane NMWCO, from 45% by the 0.3 kDa membrane to 
      2-3% by the 10 kDa membrane. Since natural DOM is mostly composed of lower MW 
      substances (<10 kDa) and the actual membrane cutoffs are normally larger than their 
      manufacturer ratings, a 0.3 kDa membrane (with an actual NMWCO of 1.9 kDa) is highly 
      recommended for colloidal size characterization of natural DOM. Among the three 
      carrier solutions, borate buffer seemed to provide the highest recovery and optimal 
      separation of DOM. Rigorous calibration with macromolecular standards and 
      optimization of system conditions are a prerequisite for quantifying colloidal size 
      distribution using the flow field-flow fractionation technique. In addition, the 
      coupling of AFlFFF with fluorescence EEMs could provide new insights into DOM 
      heterogeneity in different colloidal size fractions.

AB  - Microplastics may affect the physiology, behaviour and populations of aquatic and 
      terrestrial fauna through many mechanisms, such as direct consumption and sensory 
      disruption. However, the majority of experimental studies have employed questionably 
      high dosages of microplastics that have little environmental relevance. Predation, 
      in particular, is a key trophic interaction that structures populations and 
      communities and influences ecosystem functioning, but rarely features in 
      microplastic research. Here, we quantify the effects of low (~65-114 MP/L) and high 
      (~650-1140 MP/L) microplastic concentrations on the feeding behaviour of a 
      ubiquitous and globally representative key marine predator, the shore crab, Carcinus 
      maenas. We used a functional response approach (predator consumption across prey 
      densities) to determine crab consumption rates towards a key marine community prey 
      species, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, under low and high microplastic 
      concentrations with acute (8h) and chronic (120h) microplastic exposure times. For 
      both the acute and chronic microplastic exposure experiments, proportional prey 
      consumption by crabs did not differ with respect to microplastic concentration, but 
      significantly decreased over increasing prey densities. The crabs thus displayed 
      classical, hyperbolic Type II functional responses in all experimental groups, 
      characterised by high consumption rates at low prey densities. Crab attack rates, 
      handling times and maximum feeding rates (i.e. functional response curves) were not 
      significantly altered under lower or higher microplastics concentrations, or by 
      acute or chronic microplastic exposures. Here, we show that functional response 
      analyses could be widely employed to ascertain microplastic impacts on 
      consumer-resource interactions. Furthermore, we suggest that future studies should 
      adopt both acute and chronic microplastic exposure regimes, using 
      environmentally-relevant microplastic dosages and types as well as elevated future 
      scenarios of microplastic concentrations.

AB  - Although microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, little is 
      known about their occurrence and behavior in the terrestrial setting. In this study, 
      MPs have been isolated from soils collected from various geomorphological features 
      (yardangs, sand dunes, moving sands, seasonal lakes) of the Kavir and Lut Deserts on 
      the Iranian plateau. The number of MPs identified in 300 g samples ranged from zero 
      (not detected) in several yardang tops to 25 on some yardang hillsides, with an 
      overall average abundance of about 0.02 MP g(-1). The majority of MPs were of a 
      fibrous nature with a size distribution (≤100 μm to ≥1000 μm) skewed toward the 
      lower end, and analysis of a selection of particles by μ-Raman spectroscopy showed 
      that polyethylene terephthalate and Nylon (polyamide) were the principal polymers. 
      Scanning electron microscopy revealed intense degradation of some particles but 
      limited weathering of others. With little evidence of meso- and macroplastics in the 
      deserts, it appears that the majority of MPs are brought into these environments 
      from distant sources via the wind, with smaller, seasonal contributions from runoff 
      associated with the adjacent mountains. It is proposed that some windborne MPs are 
      transported through the deserts relatively rapidly, while others are subject to 
      internal recycling and significant photo-oxidation and mechanical weathering.

AB  - A big challenge of the 21st century is to cope with the huge amounts of plastic 
      waste on Earth. Especially the oceans are heavily polluted with plastics. To 
      counteract this issue, biological (enzymatic) plastic decomposition is increasingly 
      gaining attention. Recently it was shown that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can 
      be degraded in a saltwater-based environment using bacterial PETase produced by a 
      marine diatom. At moderate temperatures, plastic biodegradation is slow and requires 
      sensitive methods for detection, at least at initial stages. However, conventional 
      methods for verifying the plastic degradation are either complex, expensive, 
      time-consuming or they interfere with the degradation process. Here, we adapt 
      lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) as a new application for efficiently 
      monitoring enzymatic degradation of a PET glycol copolymer (PETG). LDHM is a 
      cost-effective, compact and sensitive optical method. We demonstrate enzymatic PETG 
      degradation over a time course of 43 days employing numerical analysis of LDHM 
      images.

TI  - Effects of constructed wetland system on the removal of dibutyl phthalate (DBP).
PG  - 206-11
AB  - Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) have become widely diffused in the environment via the 
      manufacturing process. Numerous experiments have shown that the bioaccumulation of 
      PAEs occurred in the aquatic and terrestrial food chain; meanwhile, it was found 
      that some of PAEs were considered as potential carcinogens, teratogens and mutagens. 
      In this research, two vertical/reverse-vertical flow constructed wetland systems 
      were set up to study its removal efficiency of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) pollution. 
      The results showed that the constructed wetland system could remove DBP effectively, 
      and the removal rates reached nearly 100%. Substrate microorganism and enzymatic 
      activities probably played key roles during DBP removal, and the removal of DBP 
      probably mainly took place in the upper layer of chamber A in the constructed 
      wetland systems.

TI  - Activity patterns within the genioglossus during suckling in domestic dogs and pigs: 
      interspecific and intraspecific plasticity.
PG  - 249-62
AB  - Suckling is universal among terrestrial mammals, but it is not clear whether 
      mechanisms of suckling are the same in mammals of differing morphology or feeding 
      ecology. An evaluation of the literature on tongue movements during suckling 
      suggests that pigs and dogs may use the tongue differently, with humans being 
      intermediate. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings of the middle and posterior 
      portions of genioglossus of pigs and dogs were compared in order to (1) see whether 
      neuromotor patterns for tongue movement during suckling can be recognized and (2) 
      identify interspecific differences in neuromotor patterns if present. A single 
      pattern of coordination was found in dogs, but results from pigs indicated 
      plasticity, both within and between individuals. The literature on humans indicates 
      that, as in pigs, suckling patterns may vary. In addition to the difference in 
      variability, pigs and dogs differed in EMG burst duration and cycle length. The 
      performance of suckling in pigs, dogs and humans, respectively, resembled the tongue 
      movements used in drinking in each species. The greater plasticity of suckling 
      behavior in pigs (and possibly humans) may be related to an ability to acquire milk 
      under a variety of environmental conditions or to a generally variable feeding 
      process characteristic of omnivorous mammals.

TI  - Effect of beta-amyloid peptide on behavior and synaptic plasticity in terrestrial 
      snail.
PG  - 40-5
AB  - A large body of evidence implicates beta-amyloid peptide (betaAP) and other 
      derivatives of the evolutionarily highly conserved amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
      in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, the functional relationship of 
      APP and its proteolytic derivatives to synaptic plasticity is not well known. We 
      demonstrate that 30 min exposure to the 25-35 fragment of betaAP do not markedly 
      change the dynamics of synaptic responses in identified neurons of terrestrial snail 
      while a significant decrease of long-term sensitization was observed after 180 min 
      betaAP bath application. In the behavioral experiments, a significant reduction of 
      sensitization, and decreased ability to develop food-aversion conditioning was 
      observed after betaAP injection. Our results clearly demonstrate that the neurotoxic 
      25-35 fragment of betaAP may play a significant role in behavioral plasticity by 
      chronically eliminating certain underlying forms of synaptic plasticity. The study 
      also proposes a novel invertebrate model to Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Most animals metamorphose, changing morphology, physiology, behavior and ecological 
      interactions. Size- and habitat-dependent mortality risk is thought to affect the 
      evolution and plastic expression of metamorphic timing, and high predation during 
      the morphological transition is posited as a critical selective force shaping 
      complex life cycles. Nonetheless, empirical data on how risk changes across 
      metamorphosis and stage-specific habitats, or how that varies with size, are rare. 
      We examined predator-prey interactions of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, 
      with an aquatic predator (giant water bug, Belostoma) and a semi-terrestrial 
      predator (fishing spider, Thaumasia) across metamorphosis. We manipulated tadpole 
      density to generate variation in metamorph size and conducted predation trials at 
      multiple developmental stages. We quantified how frog behavior (activity) changes 
      across metamorphic development, habitats, and predator presence or absence. In 
      aquatic trials with water bugs, frog mortality increased with forelimb emergence, as 
      hypothesized. In semi-terrestrial trials, contrary to predictions, predation by 
      spiders increased, not decreased, with tail resorption. In neither case did frog 
      size affect mortality. Frogs reduced activity upon forelimb emergence in the water, 
      and further with emergence into air, then increased activity with tail resorption. 
      Longer-tailed metamorphs were captured more often in spider attacks, but attacked 
      less, as most attacks followed prey movements. Metamorphs behaviorally compensated 
      for poor escape performance more effectively on land than in water, thus emergence 
      timing may critically affect mortality. The developmental timing of the ecological 
      transition between environments that select for different larval and juvenile 
      phenotypes is an important, neglected variable in studies of complex life cycles.

AB  - Plastics are globally used for a variety of benefits. As a consequence of poor 
      recycling or reuse, improperly disposed plastic waste accumulates in terrestrial and 
      aquatic ecosystems to a considerable extent. Large plastic waste items become 
      fragmented to small particles through mechanical and (photo)chemical processes. 
      Particles with sizes ranging from millimeter (microplastics, <5 mm) to nanometer 
      (nanoplastics, NP, <100 nm) are apparently persistent and have adverse effects on 
      ecosystems and human health. Current research therefore focuses on whether and to 
      what extent microorganisms or enzymes can degrade these NP. In this study, we 
      addressed the question of what information isothermal titration calorimetry, which 
      tracks the heat of reaction of the chain scission of a polyester, can provide about 
      the kinetics and completeness of the degradation process. The majority of the heat 
      represents the cleavage energy of the ester bonds in polymer backbones providing 
      real-time kinetic information. Calorimetry operates even in complex matrices. Using 
      the example of the cutinase-catalyzed degradation of polyethylene terephthalate 
      (PET) nanoparticles, we found that calorimetry (isothermal titration 
      calorimetry-ITC) in combination with thermokinetic models is excellently suited for 
      an in-depth analysis of the degradation processes of NP. For instance, we can 
      separately quantify i) the enthalpy of surface adsorption ∆(Ads)H = 
      129 ± 2 kJ mol(-1), ii) the enthalpy of the cleavage of the ester bonds ∆(EB)H = 
      -58 ± 1.9 kJ mol(-1) and the apparent equilibrium constant of the enzyme substrate 
      complex K = 0.046 ± 0.015 g L(-1). It could be determined that the heat production 
      of PET NP degradation depends to 95% on the reaction heat and only to 5% on the 
      adsorption heat. The fact that the percentage of cleaved ester bonds 
      (η = 12.9 ± 2.4%) is quantifiable with the new method is of particular practical 
      importance. The new method promises a quantification of enzymatic and microbial 
      adsorption to NP and their degradation in mimicked real-world aquatic conditions.

AB  - Adaptation to a previously unoccupied niche within a single population is one of the 
      most contentious topics in evolutionary biology as it assumes the simultaneous 
      evolution of ecologically selected and preference traits. Here, we demonstrate 
      behavioral adaptation to contrasting hydrological regimes in a sympatric mosaic of 
      Pogonus chalceus beetle populations, and argue that this adaptation may result in 
      nonrandom gene flow. When exposed to experimental inundations, individuals from 
      tidal marshes, which are naturally subjected to frequent but short floods, showed a 
      higher propensity to remain submerged compared to individuals from seasonal marshes 
      that are inundated for several months. This adaptive behavior is expected to 
      decrease the probability that individuals will settle in the alternative habitat, 
      resulting in spatial sorting and reproductive isolation of both ecotypes. 
      Additionally, we show that this difference in behavior is induced by the 
      environmental conditions experienced by the beetles during their nondispersive 
      larval stages. Hence, accidental or forced ovipositioning in the alternative habitat 
      may induce both an increased performance and preference to the natal habitat type. 
      Such plastic traits could play an important role in the most incipient stages of 
      divergence with gene flow.

AB  - Rivers are viewed as major pathways of microplastic transport from terrestrial areas 
      to marine ecosystems. However, there is paucity of knowledge on the dispersal 
      pattern and transport of microplastics in river sediments. In this study, a three 
      dimensional hydrodynamic and particle transport modelling framework was created to 
      investigate the dispersal and transport processes of microplastic particles commonly 
      present in the environment, namely, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide 
      (PA), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in river sediments. The study outcomes 
      confirmed that sedimental microplastics with lower density would have higher 
      mobility. PE and PP are likely to be transported for a relatively longer distance, 
      while PA and PET would likely accumulate close to source points. High water flow 
      would transport more microplastics from source points, and high flow velocity in 
      bottom water layer are suggested to facilitate the transport of sedimental 
      microplastics. Considering the limited dispersal and transport, the study outcomes 
      indicated that river sediments would act as a sink for microplastic pollutants 
      instead of being a transport pathway. The patchiness associated with the hotspots of 
      different plastic types is expected to provide valuable information for microplastic 
      source tracking.

TI  - Microplastics pollution in the soil mulched by dust-proof nets: A case study in 
      Beijing, China.

AB  - As a driving factor of global changes, microplastics have gradually attracted 
      widespread attention. Although MPs are extensively studied in aquatic systems, their 
      presence and fate in terrestrial systems and soil are not fully understood. In 
      China, construction-land must be mulched by dust-proof nets to prevent and control 
      fine particulate pollution, which may cause MPs pollution and increase ecological 
      risks. In order to understand the pollution characteristics and sources of MP in the 
      soil covered by dust nets, we conducted a case study in Beijing. Our results 
      revealed that the abundance of MPs in soil mulched by dust-proof nets ranged from 
      272 to 13,752 items/kg. Large-sized particles (>1000 μm) made up a significant 
      proportion (49.83%) of MPs in the study area. The dominant MP polymer types were 
      polyethylene (50.12%) and polypropylene (41.25%). The accumulation of MPs in 
      construction-site soil mulched by dust-proof nets (average, 4910.2 items/kg) was 
      significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in unmulched soil (average, 840.8 
      items/kg), which indicates a dust-proof nets as an essential source of microplastics 
      in the soil of construction land. We applied a remote-sensing data analysis 
      technique based on remote imagery acquired from a high-resolution remote-sensing 
      satellite combined with deep-learning convolutional neural networks to automatically 
      detect and segment dust-proof nets. Based on high-resolution remote sensing images 
      and using a U-net convolutional neural network, we extract the coverage area of 
      Beijing's dust-proof nets (18.6 km(2)). Combined the abundance of MPs and the 
      dust-proof nets' coverage area, we roughly estimate that 7.616 × 10(9) to 
      3.581 × 10(11) MPs accumulated in the soil mulched by the dust-proof nets in 
      Beijing. Such a large amount of MPs may cause a series of environmental problems. 
      This study will highlight the understanding of soil MPs pollution and its potential 
      environmental impacts for scientists and policymakers. It provides suggestions for 
      decision-makers to formulate effective legislation and policies, so as to protect 
      human health and protect the soil and the wider environment.

TI  - Nematode biphasic 'boom and bust' dynamics are dependent on host bacterial load 
      while linking dauer and mouth-form polyphenisms.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.15438 [doi]
AB  - Cross-kingdom interactions involve dynamic processes that shape terrestrial 
      ecosystems and represent striking examples of co-evolution. The multifaceted 
      relationships of entomopathogenic nematodes with their insect hosts and symbiotic 
      bacteria are well-studied cases of co-evolution and pathogenicity. In contrast, 
      microbial interactions in soil after the natural death of insects and other 
      invertebrates are minimally understood. In particular, the turnover and succession 
      of nematodes and bacteria during insect decay have not been well documented - 
      although it represents a rich ecological niche with multiple species interactions. 
      Here, we utilize developmentally plastic nematode Pristionchus pacificus and its 
      associated scarab beetles as models. On La Réunion Island, we collected rhinoceros 
      beetle Oryctes borbonicus, induced death, and placed carcasses in cages both on the 
      island and in a mock-natural environment in the laboratory controlling for high 
      spatial and temporal resolution. Investigating nematode population density and 
      dispersal dynamics, we were able to connect two imperative plasticities, dauer and 
      mouth form. We observed a biphasic 'boom and bust' dispersal dynamic of dauer larvae 
      that corresponds to bacterial load on carcasses but not bacterial type. Strikingly, 
      all post-dauer adults have the predatory mouth form, demonstrating novel intricate 
      interactions on decaying insect hosts. Thus, ecologically relevant survival 
      strategies incorporate critical plastic traits.

TI  - The Relative Importance of Genetic Diversity and Phenotypic Plasticity in 
      Determining Invasion Success of a Clonal Weed in the USA and China.
PG  - 213
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2016.00213 [doi]
LID - 213
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity has been proposed as an important adaptive strategy for clonal 
      plants in heterogeneous habitats. Increased phenotypic plasticity can be especially 
      beneficial for invasive clonal plants, allowing them to colonize new environments 
      even when genetic diversity is low. However, the relative importance of genetic 
      diversity and phenotypic plasticity for invasion success remains largely unknown. 
      Here, we performed molecular marker analyses and a common garden experiment to 
      investigate the genetic diversity and phenotypic plasticity of the globally 
      important weed Alternanthera philoxeroides in response to different water 
      availability (terrestrial vs. aquatic habitats). This species relies predominantly 
      on clonal propagation in introduced ranges. We therefore expected genetic diversity 
      to be restricted in the two sampled introduced ranges (the USA and China) when 
      compared to the native range (Argentina), but that phenotypic plasticity may allow 
      the species' full niche range to nonetheless be exploited. We found clones from 
      China had very low genetic diversity in terms of both marker diversity and 
      quantitative variation when compared with those from the USA and Argentina, probably 
      reflecting different introduction histories. In contrast, similar patterns of 
      phenotypic plasticity were found for clones from all three regions. Furthermore, 
      despite the different levels of genetic diversity, bioclimatic modeling suggested 
      that the full potential bioclimatic distribution had been invaded in both China and 
      USA. Phenotypic plasticity, not genetic diversity, was therefore critical in 
      allowing A. philoxeroides to invade diverse habitats across broad geographic areas.

TI  - Plasticity and superplasticity in the acclimation potential of the Antarctic mite 
      Halozetes belgicae (Michael).
PG  - 593-601
AB  - The plasticity of an organism's phenotype may vary spatially and temporally, and 
      across levels of physiological organisation. Given the adaptive value of plasticity 
      in heterogeneous environments, it might be expected that it will be expressed most 
      in a phenotype's most significant adaptive suites; at high latitudes, one of these 
      is low temperature adaptation. This study examines the phenotypic plasticity of cold 
      acclimation in the Antarctic mite, Halozetes belgicae (Michael). Both plastic and 
      'superplastic' (extreme plasticity) acclimation responses were found. Plastic 
      responses were evident in responses to laboratory acclimation and field 
      acclimatisation. 'Superplasticity' was found in its ability to rapidly cold harden 
      (RCH) at 0, -5 and -10 degrees C. For example, after just 2 h of acclimation at 0 
      degrees C, mites acclimated at 10 degrees C shifted their supercooling points (SCPs) 
      by approx. 15 degrees C. In terms of the combined speed of induction and lowering of 
      lethal temperature, this is the most potent RCH response yet reported for a 
      terrestrial arthropod. RCH was also expressed in thermal activity thresholds. 
      Mechanisms responsible for significant differences in recovery from chill torpor are 
      unknown; however, analysis of gut nucleator abundance suggest that the dynamic 
      management of supercooling potential is largely achieved behaviourally, via 
      evacuation. Comparisons with the literature reveal that plasticity in this species 
      varies latitudinally, as well as temporally. The high degree of plasticity 
      identified here is coincident with H. belgicae's occupation of the most exposed 
      spatial niche available to Antarctic terrestrial arthropods.

TI  - DGT measurement of dissolved aluminum species in waters: comparing Chelex-100 and 
      titanium dioxide-based adsorbents.
PG  - 2267-75
LID - 10.1021/es203674n [doi]
AB  - Aluminum is acutely toxic, and elevated concentrations of dissolved Al can have 
      detrimental effects on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Robust analytical 
      methods that can determine environmentally relevant Al fractions accurately and 
      efficiently are required by the environmental monitoring community. A simple, robust 
      passive sampling method, the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique, was 
      evaluated for the measurement of dissolved Al species in freshwater and marine water 
      using either Chelex-100 or Metsorb (a titanium dioxide-based binding agent) as the 
      adsorbent. Mass vs time DGT deployments at pH 5.05 (Al(3+) and Al(OH)(2+) dominate) 
      and 8.35 (Al(OH)(4)(-) dominates) demonstrated linear uptake of Al (R(2) = 0.989 and 
      0.988, respectively) for Metsorb. Similar deployments of Chelex-DGT showed linear 
      uptake at pH 5.05 (R(2) = 0.994); however, at pH 8.35 the mass of Al accumulated was 
      40-70% lower than predicted, suggesting that Chelex-100 is not suitable for Al 
      measurements at high pH. The Metsorb-DGT measurement was independent of pH (5.0-8.5) 
      and ionic strength (0.001-0.7 mol L(-1) NaNO(3)), whereas the Chelex-DGT measurement 
      was only independent of ionic strength at pH 5.0. At pH 8.4, increasing ionic 
      strength led to considerable underestimation (up to 67%) of Al concentration. 
      Deployments of Metsorb-DGT (up to 4 days) in synthetic freshwater (pH range 5.4-8.1) 
      and synthetic seawater (pH 8.15) resulted in linear mass uptakes, and the 
      concentration measured by DGT agreed well with solution concentrations. Conversely, 
      deployment of Chelex-DGT in synthetic seawater and freshwater (pH ≥7.7 Al(OH)(4)(-) 
      dominant species) resulted in a decrease in accumulated mass with increasing 
      deployment time. In situ field evaluations in fresh, estuarine, and marine waters 
      confirmed that Metsorb-DGT was more accurate than Chelex-DGT for the measurement of 
      dissolved Al in typical environmental waters.

AB  - The extent until which plastics are present in our surrounding environment 
      completely exceeds our expectations. Plastic materials in the form of microplastics 
      have been found in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments and are 
      transported through the atmosphere even to remote locations. However, we are still 
      far from understanding the effects that they may have caused and are causing to 
      biota. In the present study, we investigated the alterations in the expression of 
      twelve genes in the aquatic insect Chironomus riparius after 36 h exposures to 
      polystyrene and tire rubber microplastics at nominal concentrations of 1 and 
      10 mg L(-1). The results indicated that several genes encoding for heat shock 
      proteins (hsp90, Glycoprotein 93 (Gp93), hsc70, hsp60, hsp40, and the small HSP 
      hsp17) were overexpressed respect to the control. In addition, the genes coding for 
      manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD Mn, related to alleviation of oxidative stress) 
      and for the FK506-binding protein of 39 kDa. (FKBP39, related to development and 
      pupation) showed altered expression. Most of the alterations on gene expression 
      level occurred at a concentration of 10 mg L(-1) of tire rubber microplastics, 
      although specific modifications arose at other concentrations of both rubber and 
      polystyrene. On the contrary, one hsp gene (hsp10) and genes related to 
      biotransformation and detoxification (Cyp9f2, Cyp12a2, and ABCB6) did not alter 
      their expression in any of the treatments. Overall, the results of the gene 
      expression indicated that microplastics (especially tire rubber) or their additives 
      caused cellular stress that led to some alterations in the normal gene expression 
      but did not cause any mortality after 36 h. These results highlight the need for 
      more studies that describe the alterations caused by microplastics at the molecular 
      level. Additionally, it opens questions about the effects caused to aquatic fauna in 
      environmental realistic situations, especially in hot spots of microplastic 
      contamination (e.g., tire rubber released in storm water runoff discharge points).

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity mediates climate change responses among invasive and 
      indigenous arthropods.
PG  - 2531-7
AB  - Synergies between global change and biological invasion have been identified as a 
      major potential threat to global biodiversity and human welfare. The global 
      change-type drought characteristic of many temperate terrestrial ecosystems is 
      especially significant because it will apparently favour invasive over indigenous 
      species, adding to the burden of conservation and compromising ecosystem service 
      delivery. However, the nature of and mechanisms underlying this synergy remain 
      poorly explored. Here we show that in a temperate terrestrial ecosystem, invasive 
      and indigenous springtail species differ in the form of their phenotypic plasticity 
      such that warmer conditions promote survival of desiccation in the invasive species 
      and reduce it in the indigenous ones. These differences are consistent with 
      significant declines in the densities of indigenous species and little change in 
      those of invasive species in a manipulative field experiment that mimicked climate 
      change trends. We suggest that it is not so much the extent of phenotypic plasticity 
      that distinguishes climate change responses among these invasive and indigenous 
      species, as the form that this plasticity takes. Nonetheless, this differential 
      physiological response provides support for the idea that in temperate terrestrial 
      systems experiencing global change-type drought, invasive species may well be at an 
      advantage relative to their indigenous counterparts.

AB  - Voltammetric sensors based on screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) await diverse 
      applications in environmental monitoring, food, agricultural and biomedical 
      analysis. However, due to the single-use and disposable characteristics of SPEs and 
      the scale of measurements performed, their environmental impacts should be 
      considered. A life cycle assessment was conducted to evaluate the environmental 
      footprint of SPEs manufactured using various substrate materials (SMs: cotton 
      textile, HDPE plastic, Kraft paper, graphic paper, glass, and ceramic) and electrode 
      materials (EMs: platinum, gold, silver, copper, carbon black, and carbon nanotubes 
      (CNTs)). The greatest environmental impact was observed when cotton textile was used 
      as SM. HDPE plastic demonstrated the least impact (13 out of 19 categories), 
      followed by ceramic, glass and paper. However, considering the end-of-life scenarios 
      and release of microplastics into the environment, ceramic, glass or paper could be 
      the most suitable options for SMs. Amongst the EMs, the replacement of metals, 
      especially noble metals, by carbon-based EMs greatly reduces the environmental 
      footprint of SPEs. Compared with other materials, carbon black was the least 
      impactful on the environment. On the other hand, copper and waste-derived CNTs 
      (WCNTs) showed low impacts except for terrestrial ecotoxicity and human toxicity 
      (non-cancer) potentials. In comparison to commercial CNTs (CCNTs), WCNTs 
      demonstrated lower environmental footprint and comparable voltammetric performance 
      in heavy metal detections, justifying the substitution of CCNTs with WCNTs in 
      commercial applications. In conclusion, a combination of carbon black or WCNTs EMs 
      with ceramic, glass or paper SMs represents the most environmentally friendly SPE 
      configurations for voltammetric sensor arrangement.

AB  - Human activity and urbanization are having profound effects on natural landscapes 
      and ecosystems. The presence and persistence of human-made materials such as 
      microplastics can have major impacts on the health of organisms in both marine and 
      terrestrial environments. We quantified microplastics in herring gull (Larus 
      argentatus) and great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) nests at three colonies in 
      the northeast United States that varied in their degree of urbanization: Jamaica Bay 
      (JB) in New York City, Youngs Island (YI) on Long Island, New York, and Tuckernuck 
      Island (TN) in Massachusetts. Nests in urban colonies contained a higher proportion 
      of microplastics than those in the more remote colony. Our results link urbanization 
      with microplastic accumulation in coastal environments and suggest that assessing 
      microplastics in seabird nests could provide a means of evaluating microplastics 
      encountered by seabirds and other coastal marine animals.

AB  - The world is dealing with the mismanaged plastic waste found even in the Arctic. The 
      crisis is being tried to solve with the plastivor bugs or bio-plastics, and the 
      marine pollution profiles become priority however, putative phytotoxicity on 
      terrestrial farming have not received significant attention. Hence, 
      morpho-physiological and molecular response in maize seedlings exposed to the most 
      prevalent microplastic (MP) types (PP, PET, PVC, PS, PE) differing in their particle 
      size (75-150 μm and 150-212 μm) and combinations (PP + PET + PVC + PS + PE mix) was 
      analyzed here for a predictive holistic model. While POD1 regulating the oxidative 
      defense showed a slight down-regulation, HSP1 abundance quantified in the 
      75-150 μm MP lead a significant up-regulation particularly for PET (2.2 fold) PVC 
      (3.3 fold), and the MP mix (6.4 fold). Biochemical imbalance detected at lower sized 
      (75-150 μm) MPs in particular at the MP mix, involved the cell membrane instability, 
      lesser photosynthetic pigments and a conjectural restraint in the photosynthetic 
      capacity along with the accumulated endogenous H(2)O(2) proved that the bigger the 
      particle size the better the cells restore the damage under MP-caused xenobiotic 
      stress. The determination of the impacts of MP pollution in in-vitro agricultural 
      models might guide the development of policies in this direction and help ensure 
      agricultural security by predicting the possible pollution damage.

TI  - Identification of nanobacteria in human arthritic synovial fluid by method validated

PG  - 3324-8
AB  - Earlier we introduced a biosensor for the identification of nanobacteria in water 
      drops. Here, we generalize its principle and apply it to identify nanobacteria in 
      synovial fluid from a patient with osteoarthritis. Results indicate the prevalence 
      of nanobacteria in the synovial fluid. The identification method is applicable to 
      body fluids such as unfiltered human blood and urine, is independent of culturing 
      procedures, and permits for a rapid detection of nanoparticles in liquid drops. In 
      view of increasing clinical evidence on a contribution of nanobacteria in disease, 
      their reported detection in HIV-infected people in South Africa, laboratory 
      experiments indicating the excretion of viable (i.e., propagating) nanobacteria from 
      humans via urine, the use of human excreta in agricultural irrigation, models 
      predicting an injection of nanoaerosols contained in irrigation water enriched with 
      human excreta into the atmosphere, and the identification of nanobacteria in the 
      terrestrial atmosphere, promote the identification method described in this work to 
      an important tool to monitor nanobacteria in body fluids and environmental samples.

AB  - The abundance and composition of anthropogenic marine debris from 2012 to 2014 was 
      assessed according to three bottom trawl surveys conducted on the upper continental 
      slope between 198 m and 501 m off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan. The 
      surveys quantitated marine debris as follows: 33.52-164.62 items km(-2) (January to 
      July 2012), 91.68-215.11 items km(-2) (November 2012 to May 2013), and 160.13-178.19 
      items km(-2) (November 2013 to May 2014). Plastic bags or household materials mainly 
      dominated terrestrial sources of debris. Principal component analysis latitudinally 
      divided the study area according to debris abundance caused by geographical and 
      hydrodynamic features. The long-term effect of tsunami-associated debris on the 
      seafloor environment was recognized, because terrestrial sources such as heavy 
      household materials were most abundant throughout the study period, with the 
      additional accumulation of fishing gear and plastic bags.

AB  - Plastic products have played significant roles in protecting people during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. The widespread use of personal protective gear created a massive 
      disruption in the supply chain and waste disposal system. Millions of discarded 
      single-use plastics (masks, gloves, aprons, and bottles of sanitizers) have been 
      added to the terrestrial environment and could cause a surge in plastics washing up 
      the ocean coastlines and littering the seabed. This paper attempts to assess the 
      environmental footprints of the global plastic wastes generated during COVID-19 and 
      analyze the potential impacts associated with plastic pollution. The amount of 
      plastic wastes generated worldwide since the outbreak is estimated at 1.6 million 
      tonnes/day. We estimate that approximately 3.4 billion single-use facemasks/face 
      shields are discarded daily as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, globally. Our 
      comprehensive data analysis does indicate that COVID-19 will reverse the momentum of 
      years-long global battle to reduce plastic waste pollution. As governments are 
      looking to turbo-charge the economy by supporting businesses weather the pandemic, 
      there is an opportunity to rebuild new industries that can innovate new reusable or 
      non-plastic PPEs. The unanticipated occurrence of a pandemic of this scale has 
      resulted in unmanageable levels of biomedical plastic wastes. This expert insight 
      attempts to raise awareness for the adoption of dynamic waste management strategies 
      targeted at reducing environmental contamination by plastics generated during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Micro/nanoplastic mediated pathophysiological changes in rodents, rabbits, and 
      chicken.
LID - 10.4315/JFP-21-117 [doi]
AB  - Plastics provide tremendous societal benefits and are an indispensable part of our 
      lives. However, fragmented plastics or those intentionally manufactured in small 
      sizes (microplastics or nanoplastics) are of concern because they can infiltrate 
      soils and enter the human food chain through trophic transfer. The 
      pathophysiological impacts of micro/nanoplastics in humans are not characterized but 
      their effects in terrestrial mammals may help elucidate their potential effects in 
      human beings. Rodent studies have demonstrated that micro/nanoplastics can breach 
      the intestinal barrier, accumulate in various organs, cause gut dysbosis, decrease 
      mucus secretion, induce metabolic alterations, and cause neurotoxicity, amongst 
      other pathophysiologic effects. Larger mammals such as rabbits can also absorb 
      microplastics orally. In farm animals such as chicken, microplastics have been 
      detected in the gut, thereby raising food safety concerns. This review mostly 
      focuses on studies conducted to assess effects of micro/nanoplastic exposure through 
      food and water in terrestrial mammals and farm animals including rodents, rabbit and 
      chicken, identifies main knowledge gaps, and provides recommendations for further 
      research to understand food-borne MP/NP toxicity in humans.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity results in production of wastes, including litter in the 
      environment. The problem of waste pollution is especially noticeable and usually 
      discussed from the perspective of marine environments. It is significantly less 
      addressed in terrestrial habitats, where the spatial dispersion of litter makes it 
      difficult to assess the degree of pollution and its impact on the ecosystems. In 
      this study, we present the problem of littering the terrestrial environments in the 
      context of their inclusion in raptor nests, which are relatively rare elements of 
      these ecosystems and because they comprise the top positions in their trophic 
      chains, are exemplary bioindicators. During the breeding season we quantitatively 
      and qualitatively assessed the anthropogenic debris present in the nests of 48 Back 
      Kites (Milvus migrans) and Red kites (Milvus milvus). We found that the prevalence 
      of litter in the nests was 100% for both species. The average number of litter items 
      and average total area of litter recorded per nest was 31.3 and 0.44 m(2), 
      respectively and differed between species, where higher values were recorded for the 
      Black Kite than for the Red Kite (53.1 vs. 23.8 and 0.54 m(2) vs. 0.34 m(2), 
      respectively). Taking into account the average nest surface area of both studied 
      species (0.33 m(2) and 0.57 m(2), respectively), obtained values indicate large 
      littering of the studied nests. Furthermore, 71% of identified debris items were 
      plastics which constituted 65% of the total surface of all recorded debris. Our 
      study suggests a high availability of litter in the terrestrial habitats that 
      constitute the breeding territories of the two sympatric study species.

      between January and February 2016. The gastro-intestinal tracts of 22 of the 
      carcasses were investigated. Marine debris including netting, ropes, foils, 
      packaging material and a part of a car were found in nine of the 22 individuals. 
      Here we provide details about the findings and consequences for the animals. While 
      none of the items was responsible for the death of the animal, the findings 
      demonstrate the high level of exposure to marine debris and associated risks for 
      large predators, such as the sperm whale.

TI  - Behavioural plasticity in a native species may be related to foraging resilience in 
      the presence of an aggressive invader.
PG  - 20200877

LID - 20200877
AB  - Competition between invasive and native species can result in the exploitation of 
      resources by the invader, reducing foraging rates of natives. However, it is 
      increasingly recognized that multiple factors can enhance the resilience of native 
      species competing for limiting resources with invaders. Although extensively studied 
      in terrestrial species, little research has focused on behavioural plasticity in 
      aquatic ecosystems and how this influences native species resilience. Here, we 
      examined the role of behavioural plasticity in interactions between a native 
      Australian fish, Pseudomugil signifer, and a widespread invasive fish, Gambusia 
      holbrooki. To determine whether P. signifer displays behavioural plasticity that may 
      mitigate competition with G. holbrooki, we first quantified social behaviours 
      (aggression, submission and affiliation) and shoal cohesion for each species in 
      single- and mixed-species groups. Second, we compared the feeding rates of both 
      species in these groups to ascertain if any modulation of social behaviours and 
      cohesion related to foraging success. We found that aggressive and submissive 
      behaviours of G. holbrooki and P. signifer showed plasticity in the presence of 
      heterospecifics, but social affiliation, shoaling and, most importantly, foraging, 
      remained inflexible. This variation in the degree of plasticity highlights the

AB  - The effects of microplastics (MPs) on terrestrial organisms remain poorly 
      understood, even though soil is an important MPs sink. In this study, the earthworms 
      Eisenia fetida were exposed to 0.25% (w/w) of industrial-grade high-density 
      polyethylene (HDPE, 28-145, 133-415 and 400-1464 μm) and polypropylene (PP, 8-125, 
      71-383 and 761-1660 μm) MPs in an agricultural soil for 28 d. The results showed 
      that HDPE and PP MPs with different size ranges can be ingested by E. fetida. 
      Exposure to different size ranges of HDPE and PP MPs altered the activities of 
      superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase and induced an increase 
      in the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine level in E. fetida, suggesting that MPs-induced 
      oxidative stress occurred in E. fetida. A size and type-dependent toxicity of MPs to 
      E. fetida was demonstrated by the integrated biological response index. In addition, 
      to obtain detailed molecular information on the responses of E. fetida to MPs 
      exposure, transcriptomic analysis was conducted for E. fetida from HDPE (28-145 μm) 
      and PP (8-125 μm) treatment groups. Transcriptomic analysis identified 34,937 and 
      28,494 differentially expressed genes in the HDPE and PP MPs treatments compared 
      with the control, respectively. And, exposure to HDPE and PP MPs significantly 
      disturbed several pathways closely related to neurodegeneration, oxidative stress 
      and inflammatory responses in E. fetida. This study provides important information 
      for the ecological risk assessment of different size ranges and types of 
      industrial-grade MPs.

AB  - Temperature has pervasive effects on physiological processes and is critical in 
      setting species distribution limits. Since invading Australia, cane toads have 
      spread rapidly across low latitudes, but slowly into higher latitudes. Low 
      temperature is the likely factor limiting high-latitude advancement. Several 
      previous attempts have been made to predict future cane toad distributions in 
      Australia, but understanding the potential contribution of phenotypic plasticity and 
      adaptation to future range expansion remains challenging. Previous research 
      demonstrates the considerable thermal metabolic plasticity of the cane toad, but 
      suggests limited thermal plasticity of locomotor performance. Additionally, the 
      oxygen-limited thermal tolerance hypothesis predicts that reduced aerobic scope sets 
      thermal limits for ectotherm performance. Metabolic plasticity, locomotor 
      performance and aerobic scope are therefore predicted targets of natural selection 
      as cane toads invade colder regions. We measured these traits at temperatures of 10, 
      15, 22.5 and 30°C in low- and high-latitude toads acclimated to 15 and 30°C, to test 
      the hypothesis that cane toads have adapted to cooler temperatures. High-latitude 
      toads show increased metabolic plasticity and higher resting metabolic rates at 
      lower temperatures. Burst locomotor performance was worse for high-latitude toads. 
      Other traits showed no regional differences. We conclude that increased metabolic 
      plasticity may facilitate invasion into higher latitudes by maintaining critical 
      physiological functions at lower temperatures.

AB  - Considering that the extensive biomedical, pharmaceutics, cosmetic and other 
      industrial applications of biomaterials (BMs) is of great concern nowadays, 
      regarding their environmental risk, the present study aimed to investigate the 
      effects of four BMs, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu), 
      chitosan (CS) and modified chitosan (succinic acid grafted chitosan) (CS-Suc) in the 
      form of microplastics (particle sizes less than 1 mm) on biochemical parameters of 
      snails Cornu aspersum hemocytes. Due to the absence of knowledge about the 
      environmentally relevant concentrations of BMs, snails were initially treated 
      through their food with a wide range of nominal concentrations of each BM to define 
      the half maximal effective concentration (NRRT(50)), according to the 
      destabilization degree of hemocytes' lysosomal membranes (by mean of neutral red 
      retention time/NRRT assay). Thereafter, snails were treated with each BM, at 
      concentrations lower than the estimated NRRT(50) values in all cases, for periods up 
      to 15 days. After the end of the exposure period, a battery of stress indices were 
      measured in hemocytes of challenged snails. According to the results, all parameters 
      tested in BMs-treated snails statistically differed from those measured in BMs-free 
      snails, thus indicating the pro-oxidant potential of BMs, as well as their ability 
      to affect animals' physiology. The most considerable effect in most cases seems to 
      be caused by modified chitosan and PCL, while chitosan appears to be the least 
      toxic. A common response mechanism of snails' blood cells against the 4 BMs used in 
      the present study was shown. After exposure to each of the studied BMs a significant 
      augmentation in protein carbonyls, MDA equivalents and DNA damage, while a 
      significant reduction in NRRT values was determined in the snails hemocytes, in 
      relation to the unexposed animals. From the biochemical parameters examined, MDA 
      equivalents and DNA damage seem to be more susceptible than the other parameters 
      studied, to respond to BMs effect, with MDA to react with more sensitivity to PCL 
      and CS, while DNA damage to CS-Suc and PBSu. Our results could suggest the 
      simultaneous use of the latter biomarkers in biomonitoring studies of terrestrial 
      ecosystems against the specific BMs.

AB  - Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, triclosan and propylparaben are contaminants of emerging 
      concern that have been subjected to extensive toxicological studies, but for which 
      limited information is currently available concerning adverse effects on terrestrial 
      plant systems. The Allium cepa test, which is considered one of the most efficient 
      approaches to assess toxic effects of environmental chemicals, was selected to 
      evaluate the potential risks of these ubiquitous pollutants. Our data demonstrate 
      that all three compounds studied may in some way be considered toxic, but different 
      effects were noted depending on the chemical and the end point analysed. Results 
      derived from the analysis of macroscopic parameters used in testing for general 
      toxicity, revealed that while di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate had no apparent effects, the 
      other two chemicals inhibited A. cepa root growth in a dose-dependent manner. On the 
      other hand, although all three compounds caused alterations in the mitotic index of 
      root-tip cells, propylparaben was the only one that did not show evidence of 
      genotoxicity in assays for chromosome aberrations and micronuclei. The results of 
      the present study clearly indicate that sensitive plant bioassays are useful and 
      complementary tools to determine environmental impact of contaminants of emerging 
      concern.

AB  - Research on the environmental impact of plastics, especially on the effect of 
      microplastics (MPs), has become a priority issue in recent years, mainly in 
      terrestrial ecosystems where there is a lack of studies. This work aims to assess 
      the impact of two types of polyethylene MPs, white microbeads (W) and fluorescent 
      blue microbeads (FB), and their interactions with two contaminants, ibuprofen (Ib) 
      and simazine (Sz), on different organisms. A set of bioassays for Vibrio fischeri, 
      Caenorhabditis elegans and Lactuca sativa was carried out, which helped to establish 
      the ecotoxicological impact of those pollutants. C. elegans showed the least 
      sensitivity, while V. fischeri and L. sativa showed a high toxicological response to 
      MPs alone. We found that W and FB induced an inhibition of 27% and 5.79%, 
      respectively, in V. fischeri, and the growth inhibition rates were near 70% in 
      L. sativa for both MPs. MPs exhibited a potential role as contaminant vectors in 
      V. fischeri since the inhibition caused by W-Ib or W-Sz complexes was near 39%. The 
      W-Sz complex significantly reduced leaf development in L. sativa, and a reduction of 
      30% in seed germination was detected when the complex FB-Sz was tested. This study 
      reveals the importance of designing a complete set of analyses with organisms from 
      different trophic levels, considering the great variability in the effects of MPs 
      and the high number of relevant factors.

AB  - Earlier work on the submergence-tolerant species Rumex palustris revealed that leaf 
      anatomical and morphological changes induced by submergence enhance underwater gas 
      exchange considerably. Here, the hypothesis is tested that these plastic responses 
      are typical properties of submergence-tolerant species. Submergence-induced 
      plasticity in leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf, cell wall and cuticle thickness was 
      investigated in nine plant species differing considerably in tolerance to complete 
      submergence. The functionality of the responses for underwater gas exchange was 
      evaluated by recording oxygen partial pressures inside the petioles when plants were 
      submerged. Acclimation to submergence resulted in a decrease in all leaf parameters, 
      including cuticle thickness, in all species irrespective of flooding tolerance. 
      Consequently, internal oxygen partial pressures (pO(2)) increased significantly in 
      all species until values were close to air saturation. Only in nonacclimated leaves 
      in darkness did intolerant species have a significantly lower pO(2) than tolerant 
      species. These results suggest that submergence-induced leaf plasticity, albeit a 
      prerequisite for underwater survival, does not discriminate tolerant from intolerant 
      species. It is hypothesized that these plastic leaf responses may be induced in all 
      species by several signals present during submergence; for example, low LMA may be a 
      response to low photosynthate concentrations and a thin cuticle may be a response to 
      high relative humidity.

AB  - Human-induced trait change has been documented in freshwater, marine, and 
      terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. These trait changes are driven by phenotypic 
      plasticity and contemporary evolution. While efforts to manage human-induced trait 
      change are beginning to receive some attention, managing its ecological consequences 
      has received virtually none. Recent work suggests that contemporary trait change can 
      have important effects on the dynamics of populations, communities, and ecosystems. 
      Therefore, trait changes caused by human activity may be shaping ecological dynamics 
      on a global scale. We present evidence for important ecological effects associated 
      with human-induced trait change in a variety of study systems. These effects can 
      occur over large spatial scales and impact system-wide processes such as trophic 
      cascades. Importantly, the magnitude of these effects can be on par with those of 
      traditional ecological drivers such as species presence. However, phenotypic change 
      is not always an agent of ecological change; it can also buffer ecosystems against 
      change. Determining the conditions under which phenotypic change may promote vs 
      prevent ecological change should be a top research priority.

PG  - 764-72
LID - 10.1111/ele.12108 [doi]
AB  - Stoichiometric homeostasis of heterotrophs is a common, but not always well-examined 
      premise in ecological stoichiometry. We experimentally evaluated the relationship 
      between substrate (plant litter) and consumer (microorganisms) stoichiometry for a 
      tropical terrestrial decomposer system. Variation in microbial C : P and N : P 
      ratios tracked that of the soluble litter fraction, but not that of bulk leaf litter 
      material. Microbial N and P were not isometrically related, suggesting higher rates 
      of P than N sequestration in microbial biomass. Shifts in microbial stoichiometry 
      were related to changes in microbial community structure. Our results indicate that 
      P in dissolved form is a major driver of terrestrial microbial stoichiometry, 
      similar to aquatic environments. The demonstrated relative plasticity in microbial 
      C : P and N : P and the critical role of P have important implications for 
      theoretical modelling and contribute to a process-based understanding of 
      stoichiometric relationships and the flow of elements across trophic levels in 
      decomposer systems.

TI  - Latitudinal patterns in phenotypic plasticity: the case of seasonal flexibility in 
      lizards' fat body size.
PG  - 745-52
LID - 10.1007/s00442-013-2682-z [doi]
AB  - Several studies published over the last years suggest that the ability of many 
      species to cope with global change will be closely related to the current amount of 
      plasticity for fitness-related traits. Thus, disentangling general patterns in 
      phenotypic flexibility, which could be then included in models aimed to predict 
      changes in species distribution, represent a central goal in the current ecological 
      agenda. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) could be considered a timely and 
      promising hypothesis since it provides an explicit link between climatic and 
      geographic variables and phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, the CVH states that as 
      the range of climatic fluctuation experienced by terrestrial animals increases with 
      latitude, individuals at higher latitudes should present greater levels of 
      phenotypic flexibility. Within this framework, here we evaluate the existence of 
      latitudinal patterns in fat body size flexibility--estimated as the difference 
      between maximum and minimum fat body size values observed throughout a year--for 59 
      lizard species, comprising the first evaluation of the CVH for a trait, other than 
      thermic or metabolic characters, in ectothermic species. Conventional and 
      phylogenetic analyses indicated a positive relationship between fat body size 
      flexibility and latitude, and also between flexibility and temperature variability 
      indexes. Together with previous findings our results suggest that: (1) latitudinal 
      pattern for fitness-related traits, other than thermal characters, are beginning to 
      emerge; (2) latitude is usually a better predictor of phenotypic plasticity than 
      putative climatic variables; (3) hemispheric differences in climatic variability 
      appears to be correlated with hemispheric differences in phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution in the environment has aroused great concern. However, 
      our knowledge of MP abundance and distribution in soil environment is scarce. This 
      work investigated the MPs in the farmland and grassland at a remote area of China, 
      namely, the eastern area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The average numbers of 
      MPs were 53.2 ± 29.7 and 43.9 ± 22.3 items/kg in shallow and deep soil, 
      respectively, from 35 soil samples. A remarkable difference in MP abundances was 
      observed among soil samples from mulch farmland, greenhouses, farmland without 
      covering, and grassland. The MPs were mostly in the form of a film and transparent 
      in color in this study. The dominant polymers of MPs in the soil samples were 
      polyester (PE) and polypropylene (PP). This study revealed the characteristics of MP 
      distribution among different land use at the QTP, and MPs may stem from the 
      fragmentation of plastic mulch in farmland soil. Notably, MP abundance increased 
      with the increase in mulching time in facility agriculture. Additionally, human 
      disturbances and increased mulching time in facility agriculture promote the 
      fragmentation of soil MPs. This study provides important data for follow-up research 
      on MPs in a plateau terrestrial ecosystem.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant transitions to land require robust cell walls for regulatory 
      adaptations and to resist changing environments. Cell walls provide essential 
      plasticity for plant cell division and defense, which are often conferred by the 
      expansin superfamily with cell wall-loosening functions. However, the evolutionary 
      mechanisms of expansin during plant terrestrialization are unclear. RESULTS: Here, 
      we identified 323 expansin proteins in 12 genomes from algae to angiosperms. 
      Phylogenetic evolutionary, structural, motif gain and loss and Ka/Ks analyses 
      indicated that highly conserved expansin proteins were already present in algae and 
      expanded and purified after plant terrestrialization. We found that the expansion of 
      the FtEXPA subfamily was caused by duplication events and that the functions of 
      certain duplicated genes may have differentiated. More importantly, we generated 
      space-time expression profiles and finally identified five differentially expressed 
      FtEXPs in both large and small fruit Tartary buckwheat that may regulate fruit size 
      by responding to indoleacetic acid. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 323 expansin proteins 
      from 12 representative plants were identified in our study during 
      terrestrialization, and the expansin family that originated from algae expanded 
      rapidly after the plants landed. The EXPA subfamily has more members and 
      conservative evolution in angiosperms. FtEXPA1, FtEXPA11, FtEXPA12, FtEXPA19 and 
      FtEXPA24 can respond to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) signals and regulate fruit 
      development. Our study provides a blueprint for improving the agronomic traits of 
      Tartary buckwheat and a reference for defining the evolutionary history of the 
      expansin family during plant transitions to land.

PG  - 1085-91
AB  - Lethal and sublethal effects of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl 
      phthalate (DBP) on adult individuals of the collembolan Folsomia fimetaria were 
      investigated in the laboratory by the use of small microcosms. Effects of DEHP and 
      DBP were also tested on newly hatched collembolans in a multidish system. The 
      endpoints were juvenile mortality, growth, and development. When exposed to DEHP, 
      adults and juveniles were unaffected at all test concentrations, that is, up to 
      5,000 mg/kg. However, DBP caused increased adult mortality at 250 mg/kg and juvenile 
      mortality at 25 mg/kg. For DBP, adult reproduction was a more sensitive endpoint 
      than was survival, with an EC10 and EC50 of 14 and 68 mg/kg, respectively. Juvenile 
      molting frequency seems to be a sensitive parameter, because number of cuticles 
      produced by young springtails was reduced at 1 mg/kg. Toxicity was reduced when soil 
      spiked with DBP was stored at 20 degrees C for a period of up to 28 d before adding 
      the animals. Reduction in toxicity of DBP may be due a combination of degradation, 
      evaporation, and adsorption of DBP to soil material. This was confirmed by chemical 
      analyses, which showed a rapid initial disappearance followed by a much slower 
      disappearance. Our results lead to the overall conclusion that significant adverse 
      effects of phthalates on collembolans are not likely to occur as a result of normal 
      sewage sludge application.

AB  - Through adaptive developmental plasticity, individuals may function most effectively 
      in the type of environment in which they have spent most of their time. Such 
      habitat-specific modifications may favor active selection of that habitat type later 
      in life, further reinforcing developmentally plastic phenotypic modifications. The 
      interaction between these processes may have profound evolutionary implications. In 
      nature, Australian tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) use a complex mosaic of 
      terrestrial, arboreal, and aquatic habitats. We raised juvenile tiger snakes for the 
      first 11 months of life in enclosures mimicking one of these habitats and then 
      tested their habitat selection when offered a choice of habitat types. Snakes 
      consistently selected the habitat types in which they had been reared, and they were 
      more effective at locomotion in those habitats than in the others. This attachment 
      to a familiar habitat and phenotypically flexible adjustments in order to function 
      effectively in that habitat constitute a positive feedback loop. That is, animals 
      benefit by choosing a familiar habitat because they can fine-tune behaviors in ways 
      that enable them to function better in that habitat, and, by consistently selecting 
      that kind of habitat, they not only reinforce those phenotypically plastic 
      adjustments but also are placed under continuing selection to cope with the 
      challenges (of foraging, predator evasion, etc.) imposed by that habitat type. The 
      end result may be to create ecomorphs, whereby different individuals within a 
      population become specialized for different types of habitats even in the absence of 
      genetic differentiation.

AB  - Among ectotherms, individuals raised in cooler temperatures often have larger body 
      size and/or larger cell size. The current study tested whether geographic variation 
      in cell size and plasticity for cell size exist in a terrestrial, ectothermic 
      vertebrate, Anolis carolinensis Voigt, 1832. We demonstrated temperature-induced 
      plasticity in erythrocytes and epithelial cells of hatchlings lizards derived from 
      the eggs of females sampled from four populations and incubated at multiple 
      temperatures. Larger cells were produced in hatchlings from cooler treatments; 
      however, hatchling body size was unaffected by temperature. Therefore, 
      temperature-induced plasticity applies at the cellular, but not organismal, level in 
      A. carolinensis. In addition, reaction norms for cell size differed among 
      populations. There was a latitudinal trend in cell size and in plasticity of cell 
      size among our study populations. The two southernmost populations showed plasticity 
      in cell size, whereas the two northernmost ones did not. We suggest that selection 
      pressure for larger cell size in northern, cooler environments has restricted 
      plasticity in A. carolinensis applied at the cellular level in response to variable 
      incubation environments.

AB  - Microplastics are widespread contaminants in soils and terrestrial ecosystems in 
      many areas worldwide. In this study, we measured soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil 
      organic matter (SOM) in microplastic-treated soils to determine if the presence of 
      microplastics could affect the accuracy of carbon-based soil quality indicator 
      measurements. Six different sizes and types of microplastics were selected, and six 
      soil samples were used to evaluate the impacts. Treating soil with polyethylene and 
      low-density polyethylene significantly increased SOC (p < 0.05) when measured with 
      the modified Walkley & Black method; microplastic addition (0.01%, v/v) increased 
      SOC by >40% compared to control organic carbon-poor soil (<10.0 g kg(-1)). We 
      conclude that the microplastics can disrupt the accurate measurement of SOC. Likely, 
      the physicochemical treatment used in the SOC measurement process can cause the 
      organic compounds and/or carbon complexes to be extracted from microplastics, and 
      this can affect the results. Considering that SOC is a main indicator for assessing 
      soil quality and the global carbon cycle, overestimations caused by microplastic 
      contamination should be further discussed to identify appropriate ways to deal with 
      microplastics as a new carbon source in the environment.

TI  - Microplastic Mass Concentrations and Distribution in German Bight Waters by 
      Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Thermochemolysis Reveal Potential 
      Impact of Marine Coatings: Do Ships Leave Skid Marks?
PG  - 2285-2295
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.0c04522 [doi]
AB  - In this first mass-related survey of microplastics (MPs, <1 mm) in the German Bight 
      (North Sea, 2.5 m water depth), spatial load, temporal variations, and potential 
      sources were examined. Relevant plastic types were detected using pyrolysis-gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry/thermochemolysis (Py-GC/MS). This suitable method 
      provides qualitative and trace-level polymer or polymer cluster-specific mass 
      quantitative MP data. Neither MP concentration (2-1396 μg m(-3)) nor type 
      distribution was homogeneous. Concentrations appeared to be substantially influenced 
      by meteorological and oceanographic conditions. The coastal MP-type composition 
      showed an overprint indicating a packaging waste-related signal. Considerably 
      different compositions were observed in central and estuarine areas. Here, a close 
      relation to marine (antifouling) coating particles, i.e., abrased chlorinated 
      rubber-, acryl-styrene-, and epoxide binder-containing particles are hypothesized as 
      the main MP source, indicating ship "skid marks". They represent a dominant, 
      toxicologically relevant but underestimated marine-based MP share, inverting the 
      widely cited 80% terrestrial- to 20% marine-based debris ratio for MPs. In 
      consequence of the findings, polymer clusters attributed to the basic polymers

TI  - Creation of biological module for self-regulating ecological system by the way of 
      polymerization of composite materials in free space.
PG  - 1585-91
AB  - The large-size frame of space ship and space station can be created with the use of 
      the technology of the polymerization of fiber-filled composites and a liquid 
      reactionable matrix applied in free space or on the other space body when the space 
      ship or space station will be used during a long period of time. For the 
      polymerization of the station frame the fabric impregnated with a long-life polymer 
      matrix (prepreg) is prepared in terrestrial conditions and, after folding, can be 
      shipped in a compact container to orbit and kept folded on board the station. In due 
      time the prepreg is carried out into free space and unfolded. Then a reaction of 
      matrix polymerization starts. After reaction of polymerization the durable frame is 
      ready for exploitation. After that, the frame can be filled out with air, the 
      apparatus and life support systems. The technology can be used for creation of 
      biological frame as element of self regulating ecological system, and for creation 
      of technological frame which can be used for a production of new materials on Earth 
      orbit in microgravity conditions and on other space bodies (Mars, Moon, asteroids) 
      for unique high price mineral extraction. Based on such technology a future space 
      base on Earth orbit with volume of 10(6) m3 and a crew of 100 astronauts is 
      considered.

TI  - The development of the O(2)-sensing system in an amphibious fish: consequences of 
      variation in environmental O(2) levels.
PG  - 681-699
LID - 10.1007/s00360-021-01379-5 [doi]
AB  - Proper development of the O(2)-sensing system is essential for survival. Here, we 
      characterized the development of the O(2)-sensing system in the mangrove rivulus 
      (Kryptolebias marmoratus), an amphibious fish that transitions between hypoxic 
      aquatic environments and O(2)-rich terrestrial environments. We found that NECs 
      formed in the gills and skin of K. marmoratus during embryonic development and that 
      both NEC populations are retained from the embryonic stage to adulthood. We also 
      found that the hyperventilatory response to acute hypoxia was present in embryonic 
      K. marmoratus, indicating that functional O(2)-sensing pathways are formed during 
      embryonic development. We then exposed embryos to aquatic normoxia, aquatic 
      hyperoxia, aquatic hypoxia, or terrestrial conditions for the first 30 days of 
      embryonic development and tested the hypothesis that environmental O(2) availability 
      during embryonic development modulates the development of the O(2)-sensing system in 
      amphibious fishes. Surprisingly, we found that O(2) availability during embryonic 
      development had little impact on the density and morphology of NECs in the gills and 
      skin of K. marmoratus. Collectively, our results demonstrate that, unlike the only 
      other species of fish in which NEC development has been studied to date (i.e., 
      zebrafish), NEC development in K. marmoratus is largely unaffected by environmental 
      O(2) levels during the embryonic stage, indicating that there is interspecies 
      variation in O(2)-induced plasticity in the O(2)-sensing system of fishes.

TI  - Origin of tektites: an alternative to terrestrial impact theory.
PG  - 458-74
AB  - The Terrestrial Impact Theory (TIT) has won a complete victory over O'Keefe's lunar 
      volcanic theory, but only because the Moon appears to be the wrong place for 
      tektites. Indeed, the TIT ignores strong evidence of their volcanic origin--far from 
      the Moon. The Extraterrestrial Volcanic Comet Theory proposes an alternative to both 
      of these theories. Major arguments for an extraterrestrial tektite source are 
      paradoxical: a great time difference between tektite formation and their arrival on 
      Earth, and also forms, plastic deformations, ice collision marks, vacuum voids, etc. 
      indicating specific conditions of tektite formation such as low gravitational field, 
      lack of atmosphere, interaction of hot plastic tektites with ice, etc. Major 
      evidence of volcanic origin includes: close analogy between shaped tektites and 
      small volcanic bombs, and between layered tektites and lava or tuff-lava flows or 
      huge bombs; analogy between flanged tektites and volcanic bombs ablated by gasjets: 
      long-time, multistage formation of some tektites that corresponds to wide variations 
      in their radiometric ages; well-ordered long compositional trends (series) typical 
      of magmatic differentiation; different compositional tektite families (subseries) 
      comparable to different stages (phases) of the volcanic process. Thus, different 
      types of volcanic eruptions under extraterrestrial conditions could be reconstructed 
      based on tektite properties. It is presumed that tektites were transported to the 
      Earth by specific eruptive comets, i.e. in the form of ice-tektite agglomerates 
      launched into space by volcanic explosion. Major arguments favouring comets include: 
      ice collision marks and imprints as mentioned above; linear band-like sculpture of 
      the Australasian strewn field as evidence of comet fragmentation and slope or 
      skipping trajectory of separate fragments; compact coincidence of the Zhamanshin 
      impact crater with small tektite strewn field as evidence of steep trajectory of 
      separate comet fragments that disintegrated while entering the atmosphere. The 
      comet-Earth collision under consideration happened 10,000 years ago and caused the 
      global catastrophe marked by the sharp Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, i.e. by abrupt 
      climatic changes, the end of glaciation, mass extinction, etc. This event can be 
      compared with the "dinosaur" catastrophe at the K/T boundary 65 Ma, which was also 
      accompanied by tektite fall.

PG  - 27474-27480
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-12459-y [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, efforts for complementing data concerning microplastics (MPs) in 
      freshwater systems are required as MPs exist in many populated areas. The goal of 
      this study is to investigate the distribution and profiles of riverine MPs along the 
      Arakawa River watershed, which runs through the Tokyo Metropolitan area. The MPs 
      were found in 10 of the 12 sampling sites in the watershed with the mean of 1.8 
      pieces/m(3). Also, the spatial distribution of the MPs displayed the accumulation in 
      the downstream and in the tributary areas with high populations, reflecting the 
      levels of the local anthropogenic activities. In contrast to the heterogeneity of 
      the floating concentrations, polymer type compositions were consistent with the 
      predominance of polyethylene compared with polypropylene and polystyrene. Moreover, 
      the size distributions of the particles were consistent among samples with the 
      predominance of the relatively smaller size fractions. These results suggest that 
      the sources of fragmented plastic debris are likely spread over terrestrial areas 
      and that reducing burden from these land-based MPs is necessary for mitigating MPs 
      pollution in urban aquatic environments.

PG  - 411-7
LID - 10.1021/jf902835k [doi]
AB  - Shoot glucosinolate profiles of Brassicaceae are known to vary within species, 
      across environmental conditions, and between developmental stages. Here we study 
      whether root profiles follow the intra-specific, environmental, and developmental 
      variation observed for aerial parts in white cabbage cultivars. We also assess 
      whether greenhouse studies can be used to predict shoot and root glucosinolate 
      concentrations and profiles in the field. Root glucosinolate profiles showed 
      significant intra-specific variation; however, this variation was unrelated to that 
      in shoot profiles. One of the strongest determinants of the diversity in the root 
      profiles was 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate (gluconasturtiin). Root profiles were 
      generally comparable between greenhouse studies and field trials, whereas shoot 
      profiles were highly plastic. We conclude that among white cabbage cultivars, shoot 
      glucosinolate profiles are not indicative of root profiles. We further conclude that 
      greenhouse assessments of root glucosinolates can be reliable predictors of root 
      glucosinolate profiles in the field due to their low plasticity.

TI  - Thermal conditions during juvenile development affect adult dispersal in a spider.
PG  - 17000-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0806830105 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the causes and consequences of dispersal is a prerequisite for the 
      effective management of natural populations. Rather than treating dispersal as a 
      fixed trait, it should be considered a plastic process that responds to both genetic 
      and environmental conditions. Here, we consider how the ambient temperature 
      experienced by juvenile Erigone atra, a spider inhabiting crop habitat, influences 
      adult dispersal. This species exhibits 2 distinct forms of dispersal, ballooning 
      (long distance) and rappelling (short distance). Using a half-sib design we raised 
      individuals under 4 different temperature regimes and quantified the spiders' 
      propensity to balloon and to rappel. Additionally, as an indicator of investment in 
      settlement, we determined the size of the webs build by the spiders following 
      dispersal. The optimal temperature regimes for reproduction and overall dispersal 
      investment were 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Propensity to perform short-distance 
      movements was lowest at 15 degrees C, whereas for long-distance dispersal it was 
      lowest at 30 degrees C. Plasticity in dispersal was in the direction predicted on 
      the basis of the risks associated with seasonal changes in habitat availability; 
      long-distance ballooning occurred more frequently under cooler, spring-like 
      conditions and short-distance rappelling under warmer, summer-like conditions. Based 
      on these findings, we conclude that thermal conditions during development provide 
      juvenile spiders with information about the environmental conditions they are likely 
      to encounter as adults and that this information influences the spider's dispersal 
      strategy. Climate change may result in suboptimal adult dispersal behavior, with 
      potentially deleterious population level consequences.

AB  - Abundance, chemical composition and ecological risk of microplastics (MPs) in 
      terrestrial and marine environments have merited substantial attention from the 
      research communities. This is the first attempt to comprehend the ecological risk of 
      MPs in sediments along the Indian coast using meta-data. Polymer hazard index (PHI), 
      pollution load index (PLI) and potential ecological risk index (PERI) were used to 
      evaluate the quality of sediments. Areas have high PHI values (>1000) due to the 
      presence of polymers with high hazard scores such as polyamide (PA) and polystyrene 
      (PS). According to PLI values, sediments along the west coast of India (WCI) are 
      moderately contaminated with MPs (PLI: 3.03 to 15.5), whereas sediments along the 
      east coast of India (ECI) are less contaminated (PLI: 1 to 6.14). The PERI values of 
      sediments along the Indian coast showed higher ecological risk for the metropolitan 
      cities, river mouths, potential fishing zones and the remote islands.

AB  - A size and distance-based technique was used to assess the distribution, abundance 
      and composition of floating marine debris in the northeast Indian Ocean. Densities 
      of floating litter (>1 cm) were greater and more variable in the Straits of Malacca 
      (578±219 items km(-2)) than in oceanic waters of the Bay of Bengal (8.8±1.4 items 
      km(-2)). The density of debris in the Straits was correlated with terrestrial 
      vegetation, and peaked close to urban centres, indicating the predominance of 
      land-based sources. In the Bay of Bengal, debris density increased north of 17°N 
      mainly due to small fragments probably carried in run-off from the Ganges Delta. The 
      low densities in the Bay of Bengal relative to model predictions may result from 
      biofouling-induced sinking and wind-driven export of debris items. Standardised data 
      collection protocols are needed for counts of floating debris, particularly as 
      regards the size classes used, to facilitate comparisons among studies.

AB  - Plastic pollution is ubiquitous and not even remote protected islands are safe from 
      it. Floating debris can adsorb toxic compounds that concentrate on their surface, 
      being available to the animals that ingest them. For this reason, a baseline study 
      of plastic pollution was conducted in the remote Revillagigedo Archipelago, in the 
      Mexican Pacific Ocean. In 47 manta net samples an average of 4.8 plastics/1000m(2) 
      was found, 73% of the pieces being <5 mm. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the 
      most common polymers found. The chemical analysis of organic pollutants revealed 
      that organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated 
      biphenyls are adsorbed on the plastics collected in the area. Filter feeding 
      megafauna such as humpback whales, manta rays and whale sharks could ingest 
      contaminated micro and macroplastics. Plastics were found also on the beach, where 
      they are available to the ingestion by terrestrial animals, including endemic 
      species endangered to extinction.

AB  - Stormwater drains are important sinks for microplastics and potentially aid the 
      transport of microplastics from terrestrial to marine environments. Samples were 
      collected from sediments in five stormwater drainage systems with different land 
      uses, area, population, and sediment characteristics. Microplastic concentrations 
      within the drainage network varied between 0 and 3500 microplastics per kg of dry 
      sediment, with a mean concentration of 664 particles per kg. The majority of 
      microplastics found were fibres. Polyethylene and polypropylene were the dominant 
      polymer types (μ-FTIR). Based on a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, the expected 
      number of microplastics for a representative urban drain was 760 particles per kg, 
      with 245 particles per kg expected for an agricultural drain. Sediment grain size 
      was a predictor for microplastic abundance, with sandier sediments containing more 
      microplastics. This study is the first to quantify microplastic pollution in 
      stormwater drainage systems in Western Australia.

AB  - Plastic pollution has become a serious issue on Earth. Although efficient industrial 
      recycling processes exist, a significant fraction of plastic waste still ends up in 
      nature, where it can endure for centuries. Slow mechanical and chemical decay lead 
      to the formation of micro- and nanoplastics, which are washed from land into rivers 
      and finally end up in the oceans. As such particles cannot be efficiently removed 
      from the environment, biological degradation mechanisms are highly desirable. 
      Several enzymes have been described that are capable of degrading certain plastic 
      materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Such enzymes have a huge 
      potential for future biotechnology applications. However, they require model systems 
      that can be efficiently adapted to very specific conditions. Here, we present 
      detailed instructions, how to convert the model diatom Phaeodactylum into a 
      solar-fueled microbial cell factory for PETase expression, resulting in a whole cell 
      catalyst for PET degradation at moderate temperatures under saltwater conditions.

AB  - Chitinaceous organisms have been found to ingest microplastic; however, a 
      standardised, validated, and time- and cost-efficient method for dissolving these 
      organisms without affecting microplastic particles is still required. This study 
      tested four protocols for dissolving organisms with a chitin exoskeleton: 1) 
      potassium hydroxide (KOH) + chitinase, 2) Creon® + chitinase, 3) hydrogen peroxide 
      (H(2)O(2)) + chitinase, and, 4) Nitric Acid (HNO(3)) + hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). 
      The effects on microplastics composed of eight different polymers were also tested. 
      The use of H(2)O(2) followed by chitinase was found to be a highly efficient method. 
      The three other protocols either did not digest the chitin sufficiently or 
      negatively affected the tested polymers. A recovery test using microplastic fibres, 
      beads and tyre particles revealed high recovery rates of 0.85, 0.89 and 1 
      respectively. This further supported the applicability of the H(2)O(2) and chitinase 
      (protocol 3) for dissolving chitinaceous organisms. Thus, we recommend that future 
      investigations of microplastic (0.05 μm-5000 μm) in chitinaceous organisms (0.3 cm-5 
      cm) utilise the here presented methodology. This represents an important component 
      of the ongoing validation and harmonization of methodological approaches that are 
      urgently needed for the advancement of microplastic assessments globally.

TI  - Plasticizers in the environment: the fate of di-N-octyl phthalate (DOP) in two model 
      ecosystems and uptake and metabolism of DOP by aquatic organisms.
PG  - 244-55
AB  - The fate of the plasticizer, di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) has been examined in 33-day 
      terrestrial-aquatic and three-day aquatic model ecosystems. The five organisms of 
      the two systems contained residues of DOP, demonstrating the propensity of this 
      lipoid soluble organic molecule to be concentrated from the water. The residues in 
      the organisms in the three-day system were higher than in the 33-day system with the 
      exception of the fish, indicating perhaps, that DOP can undergo some degradation 
      before the fish is placed in the system on the 30th day. A half-life of five days 
      for DOP disappearance from the water was calculated from water samples taken 
      periodically. Further, effects of mixed function oxidase and esterase inhibitors 
      were investigated on the metabolism of DOP by various selected organisms and tissues 
      of the two ecosystems.

PG  - 257-63
AB  - The behavior at degradation by soil burial of some plasticized polyvinyl chloride 
      (PVC) based blends with a variable content of hydrolyzed collagen (HC) has been 
      followed. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The modifications induced in the environment by the 
      polymer systems (pH variation, physiologic state of the plants, assimilatory 
      pigments) were studied. Using the growth test of the terrestrial plants, we followed 
      the development of Triticum (wheat), Helianthus annus minimus (little sunflower), 
      Pisum sativum (pea), and Vicia X hybrida hort, during a vegetation cycle. After the 
      harvest, for each plant, the quantities of chlorophyll and carotenoidic pigments and 
      of trace- and macroelements were determined. RESULTS: It was proved that, in the 
      presence of polymer blends, the plants do not suffer morphological and physiological 
      modifications, the products released in the culture soil being not toxic for the 
      plants growth.

PG  - 638-40
AB  - The internal substructures of a type B sample have been examined at high 
      magnification and compared with terrestrial rocks. Selected ultrathin sections were 
      prepared from these multiphase materials by an ion-thinning technique and examined 
      in a 1-Mev electron microscope, with complementary optical analyses. The structures 
      in the ilmenite and plagioclase indicate that the lunar material has undergone 
      plastic deformation by dislocation movement and possibly microtwinning, with 
      subsequent recovery. The pyroxene exhibits complex lamellar structures of submicron 
      spacing. These various observations are consistent with the optical microscopy 
      evidence for distortion and recovery and identify the processes involved.

TI  - Mantle Modularity Underlies the Plasticity of the Molluscan Shell: Supporting Data

PG  - 622400

AB  - Molluscs have evolved the capacity to fabricate a wide variety of shells over their 
      540+ million-year history. While modern sequencing and proteomic technologies 
      continue to expand the catalog of molluscan shell-forming proteins, a complete 
      functional understanding of how any mollusc constructs its shell remains an 
      ambitious goal. This lack of understanding also constrains our understanding of how 
      evolution has generated a plethora of molluscan shell morphologies. Taking advantage 
      of a previous expression atlas for shell-forming genes in Lymnaea stagnalis, I have 
      characterized the spatial expression patterns of seven shell-forming genes in the 
      terrestrial gastropod Cepaea nemoralis, with the aim of comparing and contrasting 
      their expression patterns between the two species. Four of these genes were selected 
      from a previous proteomic screen of the C. nemoralis shell, two were targeted by 
      bioinformatics criteria designed to identify likely shell-forming gene products, and 
      the final one was a clear homolog of a peroxidase sequence in the L. stagnalis 
      dataset. While the spatial expression patterns of all seven C. nemoralis genes could 
      be recognized as falling into distinct zones within the mantle tissue similar to 
      those established in L. stagnalis, some zones have apparently been modified. These 
      similarities and differences hint at a modularity to the molluscan mantle that may 
      provide a mechanistic explanation as to how evolution has efficiently generated a 
      diversity of molluscan shells.

LID - 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2009.02260.x [doi]
AB  - California grunion Leuresthes tenuis synchronize spawning with tidal cycles, so the 
      embryos incubate in a terrestrial environment, delay hatching until cued by a 
      specific environmental trigger, and may extend incubation for up to an additional 
      four weeks. These adaptations, however, do not appear to alter the morphology or 
      sequence of early developmental stages as compared to other Atherinomorph fishes in 
      the Orders Beloniformes and Cyprinodontiformes. Embryonic development is described 
      in a series of 30 stages based on morphology observed by light microscopy. Stages 
      are placed in five periods: zygote and cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation 
      and organogenesis, and hatching competence. Embryos from a southern population of L. 
      tenuis in Los Angeles are compared with embryos found > 560 km north in San 
      Francisco Bay. Northern L. tenuis embryos developed more slowly at several stages 
      than southern embryos and reached hatching competence later, but both locations 
      maintained synchrony with the tidal cycle for both spawning and hatching. The 
      variation in rates of development and stage at hatching readiness are forms of 
      developmental heterochrony that may be associated with evolutionary adaptation or 
      morphological plasticity within this highly successful clade.

TI  - Cannabinoid regulation in identified synapse of terrestrial snail.
PG  - 3207-14
AB  - In the terrestrial snail a direct monosynaptic glutamatergic connection between the 
      primary sensory neuron and a premotor interneuron involved in withdrawal behaviour 
      can be functionally identified using electrophysiological techniques. We 
      investigated the involvement of cannabinoids in regulation of this synaptic contact. 
      The results demonstrate that the specific binding sites for agonists to mammalian 
      type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) exist in the snail's nervous system. 
      Application of a synthetic cannabinoid agonist anandamide selectively changed the 
      efficacy of synaptic contacts between the identified neurons. A decrease in the 
      long-term synaptic facilitation of the synaptic contact elicited by high-frequency 
      nerve tetanization in the presence of cannabinoid agonist anandamide was observed, 
      suggesting a possible role of endocannabinoids in regulation of plasticity at this 
      synaptic site. The selective antagonist of CB1Rs 
      [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide] 
      AM251 bath application was changing the efficacy of the synaptic contact only when 
      the postsynaptic neuron had been intracellularly activated before its application. 
      This observation implies an involvement of endocannabinoids in plasticity phenomena 
      induced by activity in the postsynaptic target. Additional support of 
      endocannabinoid involvement in synaptic function at this site was given by 
      experiments in which AM251 blocked the short-term suppression of synaptic excitation 
      evoked by low-frequency nerve tetanization, a phenomenon qualitatively similar to 
      cannabinoid-dependent synaptically evoked suppression of excitation demonstrated in 
      the mammalian nervous system. The results of the present study suggest an 
      involvement of cannabinoids in the regulation of synaptic efficacy. Further, 
      anandamide could be a candidate for an endogenous neuromessenger involved in 
      plasticity processes.

TI  - Gastrin-cholecystokinin immunoreactivity in the central nervous system of Helix 
      aspersa during rest and activity.
PG  - 29-37
AB  - The immunostaining pattern for the peptide gastrin/cholecystokinin 8 (gastrin/CCK8) 
      in the molluscan central nervous system has been considered. The changes in the 
      distribution of gastrin/CCK8 immunoreactivity were analyzed in the neurons of 
      different areas of the cerebral ganglia (mesocerebrum and metacerebrum) and in the 
      buccal ganglia of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa, during rest and active 
      phases. During the period of inactivity and after one day of activity, there were 
      several immunoreactive neurons in the mesocerebrum and metacerebrum of the snails 
      and in the buccal ganglia, whereas after 7 days of activity the number of labeled 
      neurons decreased. Data suggested a storage of gastrin/CCK8 in the neurons when 
      behavioral activities in which the peptide is involved (such as feeding-related 
      behavior) are suppressed or reduced. The different percentage of gastrin/CCK8 
      immunoreactive neurons in the left and right mesocerebrum provides information about 
      the activities controlled by these neurons, which could be related to the adaptive 
      evolution and plasticity of the brain in terrestrial pulmonates.

TI  - Caspase-like activity is essential for long-term synaptic plasticity in the 
      terrestrial snail Helix.
PG  - 129-40
AB  - Although caspase activity in the nervous system of mollusks has not been described 
      before, we suggested that these cysteine proteases might be involved in the 
      phenomena of neuroplasticity in mollusks. We directly measured caspase-3 (DEVDase) 
      activity in the Helix lucorum central nervous system (CNS) using a fluorometrical 
      approach and showed that the caspase-3-like immunoreactivity is present in the 
      central neurons of Helix. Western blots revealed the presence of 
      caspase-3-immunoreactive proteins with a molecular mass of 29 kDa. Staurosporin 
      application, routinely used to induce apoptosis in mammalian neurons through the 
      activating cleavage of caspase-3, did not result in the appearance of a smaller 
      subunit corresponding to the active caspase in the snail. However, it did increase 
      the enzyme activity in the snail CNS. This suggests differences in the regulation of 
      caspase-3 activity in mammals and snails. In the snail CNS, the caspase homolog 
      seems to possess an active center without activating cleavage typical for mammals. 
      In electrophysiological experiments with identified snail neurons, selective 
      blockade of the caspase-3 with the irreversible and cell-permeable inhibitor of 
      caspase-3 N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp-(OMe)-fluoro-methylketone 
      prevented development of the long-term stage of synaptic input sensitization, 
      suggesting that caspase is necessary for normal synaptic plasticity in snails. The 
      results of our study give the first direct evidence that the caspase-3-like activity 
      is essential for long-term plasticity in the invertebrate neurons. This activity is 
      presumably involved in removing inhibitory constraints on the storage of long-term 
      memory.

TI  - Selection on reaction norms, genetic correlations and constraints.
PG  - 115-25
AB  - Two approaches to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous 
      environments have recently been put forward. The first focuses on selection on the 
      character expression within each environment; plasticity is seen as a by-product of 
      local selection in various habitats. The second approach focuses on selection on the 
      parameters of the response function of genotypes, and selection is thought to change 
      the frequencies of 'plasticity' genes that affect the function. This paper discusses 
      the relationship between the two approaches, with emphasis on applications. A method 
      is described that allows switching from one approach to the other. It is argued that 
      character state and reaction norm approaches, while to a large extent 
      interchangeable, usually differ in the response function chosen. This choice, 
      however, may strongly affect the biological interpretation. The methods outlined in 
      this paper permit one to look at the data from different perspectives in order to 
      avoid this danger.

AB  - Residence time effects on phase transformation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) 
      (15-50 nm, with and without polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coating) were investigated in 
      reducing soils using experimental geochemistry and synchrotron-based x-ray 
      techniques. After 30 days of anaerobic incubation, a substantial fraction of 
      PVP-coated AgNPs (15 nm) were transformed into Ag₂S and or humic acid (HA) complexed 
      Ag(I), whereas only the HA fraction was dominant in uncoated AgNPs (50 nm). Several 
      investigations recently reported that sulfidation of AgNPs to Ag₂S was the 
      predominant mechanism controlling the fate of AgNP in soil-water environments. 
      However, this investigation showed each AgNP underwent particle-specific chemical 
      transformations to different end compounds after 30 days. Considering the small 
      contribution of Ag(I) dissolution from all AgNPs (less than 5%), we concluded that 
      changes in solid-state chemical speciation of sorbed AgNPs was promoted by 
      particle-specific interactions of NPs in soil chemical constituents, suggesting a 
      critical role of soil absorbents in predicting the fate of AgNPs in terrestrial 
      environments.

TI  - Removal of dissolved organic matter by anion exchange: effect of dissolved organic 
      matter properties.
PG  - 7431-7
AB  - Ten isolates of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) were evaluated to determine 
      the effect that chemical properties of the DOM, such as charge density, aromaticity, 
      and molecular weight, have on DOM removal by anion exchange. The DOM isolateswere 
      characterized as terrestrial, microbial, or intermediate humic substances or 
      transphilic acids. All anion exchange experiments were conducted using a magnetic 
      ion exchange (MIEX) resin. The charge density of the DOM isolates, determined by 
      direct potentiometric titration, was fundamental to quantifying the stoichiometry of 
      the anion exchange mechanism. The results clearly show that all DOM isolates were 
      removed by anion exchange; however, differences among the DOM isolates did influence 
      their removal by MIEX resin. In particular, MIEX resin had the greatest affinity for 
      DOM with high charge density and the least affinity for DOM with low charge density 
      and low aromaticity. This work illustrates that the chemical characteristics of DOM 
      and solution conditions must be considered when evaluating anion exchange treatment 
      for the removal of DOM.

TI  - [Beta-amyloid peptide influences behavioral plasticity in terrestrial snail].
PG  - 229-36
AB  - Influence of neurotoxic fragment of beta-amyloid peptide (25-35) on Helix lucorum 
      behavioral plasticity (sensitization and food-aversion learning) was investigated. 
      After beta-amyloid peptide (25-35) injection a significant reduction of behavioral 
      long-term sensitization was observed. It was found, that beta-amyloid peptide 
      (25-35) may interfere with associative learning and memory. Our results clearly 
      demonstrate that beta-amyloid peptide (25-35) may play a significant role in 
      behavioral plasticity by chronically eliminating certain underlying forms of 
      synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Non-native plants can impact riparian ecosystem function through diverse terrestrial 
      and aquatic pathways, with cascading effects on food webs. Invasion-mediated 
      vegetation changes can depress terrestrial arthropod communities and alter arthropod 
      flux across the aquatic-terrestrial interface. We investigated the effects of a 
      non-native woody plant, Robinia neomexicana, on insect contributions to riparian 
      songbird diets. This plant was introduced over 100 years ago to the Clear Creek 
      drainage in northwestern Colorado (USA) from its native range, which extends into 
      southern Colorado. We used stable isotope analysis of insects and avian feces to 1) 
      assess whether the relative contributions of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived 
      arthropod prey differed between reference sites and sites invaded by R. neomexicana, 
      and 2) quantify the amount of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived resources consumed by 
      an insectivorous songbird assemblage. Two species of insectivorous songbirds 
      consumed more aquatic insects in invaded sites compared to reference sites. This 
      change in terrestrial- and aquatic-derived prey in bird diets in response to a 
      near-range plant invasion suggests that the introduction of novel species from more 
      distant native ranges could produce similar or stronger effects. Overall, the 
      songbird community consumed approximately 34% aquatic resources, which highlights 
      the importance of these subsidies to riparian consumers. Our investigation of insect 
      subsidies demonstrates how introduced species can indirectly affect food webs and 
      provides insight into the plasticity of riparian consumer responses.

AB  - Phenotypic divergence between populations, i.e. how much phenotypes within a species 
      vary geographically, is critical to many aspects of ecology and evolution, including 
      eco-geographical trends, speciation and coexistence. Yet, the variation of 
      divergence across species with different ecologies and distributions and the 
      relative role of adaptive causes remains little understood. We predict that genetic 
      control vs. phenotypic plasticity of traits, geographical distance and (assuming 
      adaptation) environmental differences should explain much of the phenotypic 
      variability between populations. We tested these predictions with body sizes of 1447 
      populations in 98 terrestrial vertebrate species. Population phenotypic variability 
      differs strongly across species, and divergence increases with increasing levels of 
      clade-typical phenotypic plasticity, the area covered by populations and body size. 
      Geographical distance and environmental dissimilarity are similarly important 
      predictors of divergence within species, highlighting a potential role for biotic 
      and environmental conditions. Increased availability of phylogeographical and 
      ecological data should facilitate further understanding of population divergence 
      drivers at broad scales.

TI  - Blend configuration in functional polymeric materials with a high lignin content.
PG  - 43-59
LID - 10.1039/c7fd00083a [doi]
AB  - Lignins upgrade the lignocellulosic cell-wall domains in all vascular plants; they 
      embody 20-30% of terrestrial organic carbon. For 50 years, mistaken assumptions 
      about the configuration of lignin have hindered the development of useful polymeric 
      materials with a lignin content above 40 wt%. Now, polymeric materials composed only 
      of methylated softwood lignin derivatives can exhibit better tensile behavior than 
      polystyrene. Marked improvements may be achieved with small quantities (5-10 wt%) of 
      miscible blend components as simple as poly(ethylene glycol). These observations 
      contradict commonly held views about crosslinking or hyper-branching in lignin 
      chains. The hydrodynamic compactness of the macromolecular lignin species arises 
      from powerful noncovalent interactions between the lignin substructures. Individual 
      lignin components undergo association to form macromolecular complexes that are 
      preserved in plastics with a very high lignin content. Material continuity results 
      from interpenetration between the peripheral components in adjoining lignin 
      complexes. Through interactions with the peripheral domains, miscible blend 
      components modulate the strength and ductility of these utterly original 
      lignin-based plastics.

TI  - Developmental phenotypic plasticity helps bridge stochastic weather events 
      associated with climate change.
LID - jeb161984 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.161984 [doi]
AB  - The slow, inexorable rise in annual average global temperatures and acidification of 
      the oceans are often advanced as consequences of global change. However, many 
      environmental changes, especially those involving weather (as opposed to climate), 
      are often stochastic, variable and extreme, particularly in temperate terrestrial or 
      freshwater habitats. Moreover, few studies of animal and plant phenotypic plasticity 
      employ realistic (i.e. short-term, stochastic) environmental change in their 
      protocols. Here, I posit that the frequently abrupt environmental changes (days, 
      weeks, months) accompanying much longer-term general climate change (e.g. global 
      warming over decades or centuries) require consideration of the true nature of 
      environmental change (as opposed to statistical means) coupled with an expansion of 
      focus to consider developmental phenotypic plasticity. Such plasticity can be in 
      multiple forms - obligatory/facultative, beneficial/deleterious - depending upon the 
      degree and rate of environmental variability at specific points in organismal 
      development. Essentially, adult phenotypic plasticity, as important as it is, will 
      be irrelevant if developing offspring lack sufficient plasticity to create modified 
      phenotypes necessary for survival.

TI  - The hominins: a very conservative tribe? Last common ancestors, plasticity and

PG  - 686-99
LID - 10.1111/joa.12424 [doi]
AB  - In the early 20th century the dominant paradigm for the ecological context of the 
      origins of human bipedalism was arboreal suspension. In the 1960s, however, with 
      recognition of the close genetic relationship of humans, chimpanzees and bonobos, 
      and with the first field studies of mountain gorillas and common chimpanzees, it was 
      assumed that locomotion similar to that of common chimpanzees and mountain gorillas, 
      which appeared to be dominated by terrestrial knuckle-walking, must have given rise 
      to human bipedality. This paradigm has been popular, if not universally dominant, 
      until very recently. However, evidence that neither the knuckle-walking or vertical 
      climbing of these apes is mechanically similar to human bipedalism, as well as the 
      hand-assisted bipedality and orthograde clambering of orang-utans, has cast doubt on 
      this paradigm. It now appears that the dominance of terrestrial knuckle-walking in 
      mountain gorillas is an artefact seen only in the extremes of their range, and that 
      both mountain and lowland gorillas have a generalized orthogrady similar to that 
      seen in orang-utans. These data, together with evidence for continued arboreal 
      competence in humans, mesh well with an increasing weight of fossil evidence 
      suggesting that a mix of orang-utan and gorilla-like arboreal locomotion and upright 
      terrestrial bipedalism characterized most australopiths. The late split date of the 
      panins, corresponding to dates for separation of Homo and Australopithecus, leads to 
      the speculation that competition with chimpanzees, as appears to exist today with 
      gorillas, may have driven ecological changes in hominins and perhaps cladogenesis. 
      However, selection for ecological plasticity and morphological conservatism is a 
      core characteristic of Hominidae as a whole, including Hominini.

AB  - The plasticizer bisphenol-A (BPA) is common to municipal wastewaters and can exert 
      toxicity to exposed organisms in the environment. Here BPA concentration at 5 sewage 
      treatment works (STW) and distribution throughout a river catchment in South West UK 
      were investigated. Sampling sites included influent and effluent wastewater (n = 5), 
      river water (n = 7) and digested sludge (n = 2) which were monitored for 7 
      consecutive days. Findings revealed average BPA loads in influent wastewater at two 
      STWs were 10-37 times greater than the other wastewaters monitored. Concentrations 
      up to ~100 μg L(-1) were measured considerably higher than previously reported for 
      municipal wastewaters. Temporal variability throughout the week (i.e., highest 
      concentrations during weekdays) suggests these high concentrations are linked with 
      industrial activity. Despite ≥90% removal during wastewater treatment, notable 
      concentrations remained in tested effluent (62-892 ng L(-1)). However, minimal 
      impact on BPA concentrations in river water was observed for any of the effluents. 
      The maximum BPA concentration found in river water was 117 ng L(-1) which is 
      considerably lower than the current predicted no effect concentration of 
      1.6 μg L(-1). Nevertheless, analysis of digested sludge from sites which received 
      these elevated BPA levels revealed average concentrations of 4.6 ± 0.3 and 
      38.7 ± 5.4 μg g(-1). These sludge BPA concentrations are considerably greater than 
      previously reported and are attributed to the high BPA loading in influent 
      wastewater. A typical sludge application regime to agricultural land would result in 
      a predicted BPA concentration of 297 ng g(-1) in soil. Further studies are needed on 
      the toxicological thresholds of exposed terrestrial organisms in amended soils to 
      better assess the environmental risk here.

TI  - Responses to river inundation pressures control prey selection of riparian beetles.
PG  - e61866

LID - e61866
AB  - BACKGROUND: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation (flooding) and 
      are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability in aquatic/terrestrial 
      subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of this subsidy in active riparian 
      floodplains is thought to underpin local biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates 
      dominate the fauna, exhibiting traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic 
      subsidies while reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species 
      micro-spatial positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not 
      known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from either aquatic or 
      terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to inundation tolerance and 
      avoidance. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat 
      analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to inundation 
      risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The study examined patch 
      scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of the aquatic subsidy according to 
      species traits. Prey sourced from terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic 
      invertebrates varied in relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance 
      strategies. Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest 
      proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting uptake. Less 
      able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and switched to a terrestrial 
      diet under moderate inundation pressures. All trait groups showed a seasonal shift 
      in diet towards terrestrial prey in the early spring. Prey selection became 
      exaggerated towards aquatic prey in downstream samples. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Our results suggest that partitioning of resources and habitat creates overlapping 
      niches that increase the processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By 
      demonstrating functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain 
      ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological variability. With 
      an increasing interest in reconnecting rivers to their floodplains, these 
      invertebrates represent a key functional element in ensuring that such reconnections 
      have demonstrable ecological value.

AB  - Understanding sources of variation in animal thermal limits is critical to 
      forecasting ecological responses to climate change. Here, we estimated upper and 
      lower thermal limits, and their capacity to respond to thermal acclimation, in 
      several species and populations of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) from diverse 
      geographic regions representative of variable climate within South Africa. We also 
      considered ecoregions and latitudinal ranges as potential predictors of thermal 
      limits and the plasticity thereof. For upper thermal limits, species showed 
      significant variation and limited acclimation-related plasticity. Lower thermal 
      limits responded to acclimation in some cases and showed marked variation among 
      species that could be explained by taxonomic affiliation and ecoregion. Limited 
      acclimation ability in the species included in this study suggest plasticity of 
      thermal limits will not be a likely buffer for coping with climate change. From the 
      present results for the Dytiscidae of the region, it appears the group may be 
      particularly susceptible to heat and/or drought and may thus serve as useful 
      indicator species of ecosystem change. Understanding how these climate-related 
      impacts play out at different spatial and temporal scales will have profound 
      implications for conservation management and functional responses, especially 
      important in a region already showing a trend for warming and drying.

TI  - Hypomethylation of the aquatic invasive plant, Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. 
      hexapetala mimics the adaptive transition into the terrestrial morphotype.
PG  - 280-298
LID - 10.1111/ppl.13162 [doi]
AB  - Ongoing global changes affect ecosystems and open up new opportunities for 
      biological invasion. The ability of invasive species to rapidly adapt to new 
      environments represents a relevant model for studying short-term adaptation 
      mechanisms. The aquatic invasive plant, Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala, is 
      classified as harmful in European rivers. In French wet meadows, this species has 
      shown a rapid transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments with emergence of 
      two distinct morphotypes in 5 years. To understand the heritable mechanisms involved 
      in adjustment to such a new environment, we investigate both genetic and epigenetic 
      as possible sources of flexibility involved in this fast terrestrial transition. We 
      found a low overall genetic differentiation between the two morphotypes arguing 
      against the possibility that terrestrial morphotype emerged from a new adaptive 
      genetic capacity. Artificial hypomethylation was induced on both morphotypes to 
      assess the epigenetic hypothesis. We analyzed global DNA methylation, morphological 
      changes, phytohormones and metabolite profiles of both morphotype responses in both 
      aquatic and terrestrial conditions in shoot and root tissues. Hypomethylation 
      significantly affected morphological variables, phytohormone levels and the amount 
      of some metabolites. The effects of hypomethylation depended on morphotypes, 
      conditions and plant tissues, which highlighted differences among the morphotypes 
      and their plasticity. Using a correlative integrative approach, we showed that 
      hypomethylation of the aquatic morphotype mimicked the characteristics of the 
      terrestrial morphotype. Our data suggest that DNA methylation rather than a new 
      adaptive genetic capacity is playing a key role in L. grandiflora subsp. hexapetala 
      plasticity during its rapid aquatic to terrestrial transition.

AB  - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is widespread in terrestrial and aquatic species, 
      plastic in response to environmental changes. Isoetes L. is one of the earliest 
      basal vascular plants and CAM is popular in this genus. Isoetes sinensis Palmer is 
      an amphibious species, alternating frequently between terrestrial and aquatic 
      environments. Given this, we investigated and compared photosynthetic 
      characteristics over a diurnal cycle under submerged condition (SC) and terrestrial 
      condition (TC). The results suggest that I. sinensis possesses a stronger CAM 
      capacity under SC. Compared with under TC, titratable acidity levels and organic 
      acid concentrations were more enriched under SC, whereas soluble sugar or starch and 
      protein levels were lower under SC. Transcript analyses for nine photosynthetic 
      genes revealed that CAM-associated genes possessed high transcripts under SC, but 
      C3-related transcripts were highly expressed under TC. In addition, the enzyme 
      activity measurements demonstrated that PEPC activity over a diurnal cycle was 
      slightly higher under SC, whereas Rubisco activity during the daytime was greater 
      under TC. This comprehensive study probably facilitates general understandings about 
      the CAM photosynthetic characteristics of Isoetes in response to the environmental 
      changes.

AB  - Laying eggs out of water was crucial to the transition to land and has evolved 
      repeatedly in multiple animal phyla. However, testing hypotheses about this 
      transition has been difficult because extant species only breed in one environment. 
      The pantless treefrog, Dendropsophus ebraccatus, makes such tests possible because 
      they lay both aquatic and arboreal eggs. Here, we test the oviposition site choices 
      of D. ebraccatus under conflicting risks of arboreal egg desiccation and aquatic egg 
      predation, thereby estimating the relative importance of each selective agent on 
      reproduction. We also measured discrimination between habitats with and without 
      predators and development of naturally laid aquatic and arboreal eggs. Aquatic 
      embryos in nature developed faster than arboreal embryos, implying no cost to 
      aquatic egg laying. In choice tests, D. ebraccatus avoided habitats with fish, 
      showing that they can detect aquatic egg predators. Most importantly, D. ebraccatus 
      laid most eggs in the water when faced with only desiccation risk, but switched to 
      laying eggs arboreally when desiccation risk and aquatic predators were both 
      present. This provides the first experimental evidence to our knowledge that aquatic 
      predation risk influences non-aquatic oviposition and strongly supports the 
      hypothesis that it was a driver of the evolution of terrestrial reproduction.

TI  - Evolution without standing genetic variation: change in transgenerational plastic 
      response under persistent predation pressure.
PG  - 266-281

AB  - Transgenerational phenotypic plasticity is a fast non-genetic response to 
      environmental modifications that can buffer the effects of environmental stresses on 
      populations. However, little is known about the evolution of plasticity in the 
      absence of standing genetic variation although several non-genetic inheritance 
      mechanisms have now been identified. Here we monitored the pea aphid 
      transgenerational phenotypic response to ladybird predators (production of winged 
      offspring) during 27 generations of experimental evolution in the absence of initial 
      genetic variation (clonal multiplication starting from a single individual). We 
      found that the frequency of winged aphids first increased rapidly in response to 
      predators and then remained stable over 25 generations, implying a stable phenotypic 
      reconstruction at each generation. We also found that the high frequency of winged 
      aphids persisted for one generation after removing predators. Winged aphid frequency 
      then entered a refractory phase during which it dropped below the level of control 
      lines for at least two generations before returning to it. Interestingly, the 
      persistence of the winged phenotype decreased and the refractory phase lasted longer 
      with the increasing number of generations of exposure to predators. Finally, we 
      found that aphids continuously exposed to predators for 22 generations evolved a 
      significantly weaker plastic response than aphids never exposed to predators, which, 
      in turn, increased their fitness in presence of predators. Our findings therefore 
      showcased an example of experimental evolution of plasticity in the absence of 
      initial genetic variation and highlight the importance of integrating several 
      components of non-genetic inheritance to detect evolutionary responses to 
      environmental changes.

AB  - Species that inhabit marine and intertidal ecosystems face osmoregulatory 
      challenges, risking dehydration and increased ion concentrations in the body. 
      Lizards need to either tolerate or regulate these increased ion concentrations. In 
      this study, we aim to understand how Suter's skink (Oligosoma suteri), an intertidal 
      skink restricted to shoreline habitats, is able to cope with the physiological 
      stress of living in an extreme salt environment. We determined the diet, prey 
      species' salt content, and nasal and cloacal salt excretion on Rangitoto and 
      Motutapu Islands in northern New Zealand, where the skinks have contrasting access 
      to terrestrial invertebrates. Analysis of stable isotopes suggests inter- and 
      intra-population variability in Suter's skink diets. Intertidal invertebrates under 
      washed up seaweed appear to compose a major part of the diet of the Rangitoto 
      population, while the Motutapu population showed evidence for a mixed diet of 
      terrestrial and intertidal invertebrates. Sodium content of prey species decreased 
      with an increasing distance from the seawater. Field secretion of cations through 
      nasal glands consisted primarily of Na(+), which is consistent with other marine and 
      intertidal species. Sodium was also the primary cation in urine. In contrast, fecal 
      cations consisted primarily of K(+). This first study into the salt secretion of an 
      intertidal skink species provides evidence of Suter's skink's plasticity in 
      secreting excess ions through nasal salt glands. This likely enables it to deal with 
      the challenges of living in a semi-marine habitat.

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary consequences of size-selective harvesting: how much do 
      we know?
PG  - 209-20
AB  - Size-selective harvesting, where the large individuals of a particular species are 
      preferentially taken, is common in both marine and terrestrial habitats. 
      Preferential removal of larger individuals of a species has been shown to have a 
      negative effect on its demography, life history and ecology, and empirical studies 
      are increasingly documenting such impacts. But determining whether the observed 
      changes represent evolutionary response or phenotypic plasticity remains a 
      challenge. In addition, the problem is not recognized in most management plans for 
      fish and marine invertebrates that still mandate a minimum size restriction. We use 
      examples from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to illustrate some of the 
      biological consequences of size-selective harvesting and discuss possible future 
      directions of research as well as changes in management policy needed to mitigate 
      its negative biological impacts.

TI  - Context dependence of transgenerational plasticity: the influence of parental 
      temperature depends on offspring environment and sex.
PG  - 391-401
LID - 10.1007/s00442-020-04783-w [doi]
AB  - Under environmental change, the relationship between phenotype and fitness can 
      change rapidly, leaving populations vulnerable. Plasticity within and between 
      generations could provide the fastest mitigation to environmental change. However, 
      plasticity may depend on interactions among parental environment, offspring 
      environment and offspring sex, and we know little of how these interactions 
      manifest. We examine the importance of parental and offspring thermal environment in 
      the context of a terrestrial ectotherm (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus), 
      where the thermal environment depends on complex thermoregulatory behaviours. By 
      manipulating both parental and offspring thermoregulatory (basking) opportunities in 
      a full factorial design, we found that transgenerational plasticity was highly 
      context dependent. Overall, longer parental thermoregulatory opportunities led to 
      increased growth in offspring, providing a clear fitness benefit to daughters but 
      inducing a cost of increased oxidative stress in sons. Daughters, but not sons, 
      received the greatest advantage when their thermal environment matched that of their 
      parents. The offspring thermal environment had little independent effect on 
      offspring phenotype. Together, the results suggest that both directional selection 
      on offspring size (leading to growth being dependent on thermal conditions) and 
      selection for anticipatory parental effects operate, but with a different balance in 
      males and females. More broadly, restrictions in thermoregulatory opportunities 
      under climatic warming will have negative consequences both within and between 
      generations, but the exact nature will depend on the evolved functional form of 
      plasticity.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs), plastic particles <5 mm, are found in environments, including 
      terrestrial ecosystems, planetwide. Most research so far has focused on 
      ecotoxicology, examining effects on performance of soil biota in controlled 
      settings. As research pivots to a more ecosystem and global change perspective, 
      questions about soil-borne biogeochemical cycles become important. MPs can affect 
      the carbon cycle in numerous ways, for example, by being carbon themselves and by 
      influencing soil microbial processes, plant growth, or litter decomposition. Great 
      uncertainty surrounds nano-sized plastic particles, an expected by-product of 
      further fragmentation of MPs. A major concerted effort is required to understand the 
      pervasive effects of MPs on the functioning of soils and terrestrial ecosystems; 
      importantly, such research needs to capture the immense diversity of these particles 
      in terms of chemistry, aging, size, and shape.

AB  - Although environmental research has recently begun to focus on the ubiquity of 
      microplastics in terrestrial systems, there is still lack of comprehensive data 
      which describe microplastics levels in soils and the factors influencing the 
      distribution of this contaminant. Here, we show that microplastics contamination 
      (3877 ± 2356 p kg(1)) is omnipresent in numerous soil samples collected along the 
      Yangtze River. Subsoils (4005 ± 2472 p kg(1)) showed higher levels of microplastics 
      than topsoils (3748 ± 2301 p kg(1)), while polyamide (32%) was the most commonly 
      found polymer in the samples. Small microplastics particles (< 200 µm) accounted for 
      approximately 70% of the microplastics detected in subsoils. In terms of shape, 
      microfragments were the most common type of microplastic particle, accounting for 
      34% of total microplastics, followed by microfibers (30%). Furthermore, 
      microplastics contamination was found to be positively correlated with both the 
      population of the study area and precipitation, yet negatively correlated with the 
      elevation of the sampling site. Our study represents the first large-scale study of 
      microplastic contamination in riparian soils along the Yangtze River, and provides 
      important data regarding the ecotoxicology and ecosystem effects of microplastics in 
      terrestrial environments.

AB  - The skin epithelium, ie, the epidermis, of dolphins and whales (cetaceans) is up to 
      50 times thicker than that of humans and other mammals living on land. Recently, 
      comparative genomics revealed further striking differences in the cytoskeleton of 
      the outer layers of the epidermis in aquatic and terrestrial mammals. Cetaceans lack 
      the cytoskeletal keratins, which make up more than half of the total protein mass in 
      the cornified epidermal layer of terrestrial mammals under homeostatic conditions. 
      By contrast, orthologs of stress-inducible epithelial keratins are conserved in 
      cetaceans and these keratins are constitutively expressed in their skin. Thus, the 
      epidermal stress response program of a terrestrial common ancestor of modern mammals 
      has become the default program of epidermal differentiation and a central component 
      of the unique cutaneous organization of cetaceans. We propose that phenotypic 
      plasticity during stress responses plays important roles in the evolution of the 
      skin.

TI  - Rodents in relation to problems of arthropod-borne diseases.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - Because rodents are numerically predominant in most terrestrial biotopes, exhibit a 
      high degree of ecological plasticity and live in close contact with both man and a 
      number of blood-sucking arthropods, they have become the main reservoirs of many 
      human diseases occurring in natural foci, including some that spread without the 
      intervention of a vector. The author describes the unique ecological characteristics 
      of rodents, analyses their role in the maintenance of infection in natural foci, and 
      examines the conditions under which epizootics among rodents may give rise to 
      epidemics in man. In the light of such knowledge, it is possible to forecast the 
      epizootic and epidemiological situation several months in advance and to improve the 
      efficacy of control measures based on rodent eradication.

      transition in an amphibious fish.
LID - 10.1242/jeb.235515 [doi]
LID - jeb235515
AB  - The terrestrial radiation of vertebrates required changes in skin that resolved the 
      dual demands of maintaining a mechanical and physiological barrier while also 
      facilitating ion and gas transport. Using the amphibious killifish Kryptolebias 
      marmoratus, we found that transcriptional regulation of skin morphogenesis was 
      quickly activated upon air exposure (1 h). Rapid regulation of cell-cell adhesion 
      complexes and pathways that regulate stratum corneum formation was consistent with 
      barrier function and mechanical reinforcement. Unique blood vessel architecture and 
      regulation of angiogenesis likely supported cutaneous respiration. Differences in 
      ionoregulatory transcripts and ionocyte morphology were correlated with differences 
      in salinity acclimation and resilience to air exposure. Evolutionary analyses 
      reinforced the adaptive importance of these mechanisms. We conclude that rapid 
      plasticity of barrier, respiratory and ionoregulatory functions in skin evolved to 
      support the amphibious lifestyle of K. marmoratus; similar processes may have 
      facilitated the terrestrial radiation of other contemporary and ancient fishes.

TI  - Terrestrial isopods associated with shallow underground of forested scree slopes in 
      the Western Carpathians (Slovakia).
PG  - 323-335
LID - 10.3897/zookeys.801.24113 [doi]
AB  - The shallow underground of forested scree slopes represents a little-studied 
      subterranean biotope. In this paper, species diversity and depth distribution of 
      terrestrial isopod communities studied in the depth profile (5-95 cm from the 
      surface) of eight forested scree slopes in the Western Carpathians (Slovakia) is 
      discussed. The southern edge of the Western Carpathians where the study sites are 
      located represents the northernmost limit of distribution of obligate subterranean 
      fauna in Europe. The sites differ from each other in type of bedrock, forest 
      composition, slope aspect, and altitude. To sample isopods, a set of three 
      subterranean pitfall traps consisting of a plastic cylinder (Ø 110 mm) and ten 
      plastic cups was buried in each studied scree slope. In total, 252 isopods belonging 
      to eleven species were sampled (1-5 species per site). Of the species found, the 
      blind and depigmented Mesoniscusgraniger was the sole species closely associated 
      with deeper parts of the depth profile and was present in most of the sites studied. 
      Another ten species were represented by a small number of individuals and their 
      occurrence deeper in the scree slope profile was rather accidental. A comparison 
      between winter and summer periods indicates apparent differences in seasonal 
      activities of isopods. Ethylene glycol seems to be more appropriate fixative 
      solution for trapping isopods than formaldehyde.

AB  - Trabecular bone is responsive to mechanical loading, and thus may be a useful tool 
      for interpreting past behaviour from fossil morphology. However, the ability to 
      meaningfully interpret variation in archaeological and hominin trabecular morphology 
      depends on the extent to which trabecular bone properties are integrated throughout 
      the postcranium or are locally variable in response to joint specific loading. We 
      investigate both of these factors by comparing trabecular bone throughout the lower 
      limb between a group of highly mobile foragers and two groups of sedentary 
      agriculturalists. Trabecular bone structure is quantified in four volumes of 
      interest placed within the proximal and distal joints of the femur and tibia. We 
      determine how trabecular structures correspond to inferred behavioural differences 
      between populations and whether the patterns are consistent throughout the limb. A 
      significant correlation was found between inferred mobility level and trabecular 
      bone structure in all volumes of interest along the lower limb. The greater 
      terrestrial mobility of foragers is associated with higher bone volume fraction, and 
      thicker and fewer trabeculae (lower connectivity density). In all populations, bone 
      volume fraction decreases while anisotropy increases proximodistally throughout the 
      lower limb. This observation mirrors reductions in cortical bone mass resulting from 
      proximodistal limb tapering. The reduction in strength associated with reduced bone 
      volume fraction may be compensated for by the increased anisotropy in the distal 
      tibia. A similar pattern of trabecular structure is found throughout the lower limb 
      in all populations, upon which a signal of terrestrial mobility appears to be 
      superimposed. These results support the validity of using lower limb trabecular bone 
      microstructure to reconstruct terrestrial mobility levels from the archaeological 
      and fossil records. The results further indicate that care should be taken to 
      appreciate variation resulting from differences in habitual activity when inferring 
      behaviour from the trabecular structure of hominin fossils through comparisons with 
      modern humans.

AB  - Platydemus manokwari is a broadly distributed invasive terrestrial flatworm that 
      preys heavily on land snails and has been credited with the demise of numerous 
      threatened island faunas. We examined whether P. manokwari tracks the mucus trails 
      of land snail prey, investigated its ability to determine trail direction, and 
      evaluated prey preference among various land snail species. A plastic treatment 
      plate with the mucus trail of a single species and a control plate without the trail 
      were placed side by side at the exit of cages housing P. manokwari. All trials were 
      then videotaped overnight. The flatworms moved along plates with mucus trails, but 
      did not respond to plates without trails, blank control (distilled water), or with 
      conspecific flatworm trails. When presented at the midpoint of a snail mucus trail, 
      the flatworms followed the trail in a random direction. The flatworms showed a 
      preference when choosing between two plates, each with a mucus trail of different 
      land snail species. Our results suggest that P. manokwari follows snail mucus trails 
      based on chemical cues to increase the chance of encountering prey; however, 
      trail-tracking behavior showed no directionality.

TI  - Inconsistent intraspecific pattern in leaf life span along nitrogen-supply gradient.
PG  - 342-346
LID - 10.3732/ajb.1600435 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Leaf life span (LLS) has long been hypothesized to plastically 
      increase with decreasing nitrogen (N) supply from soil to maximize N retention, 
      carbon assimilation, and fitness; however, accumulating evidence shows no consistent 
      trend. The apparent inconsistencies are explained by a recent model that assumes LLS 
      has a hump-shaped quadratic response to the N-supply gradient. The available 
      evidence mostly originates from comparisons of LLS at only two levels of N 
      availability, and the hypothesis remains unanswered. METHODS: We investigated LLS of 
      two asteraceous forbs (Adenocaulon himalaicum and Xanthium canadense) experimentally 
      grown at eight levels of N supply, which covered a range of N supply in their 
      natural habitats. We additionally conducted a literature search to retrieve studies 
      reporting LLS response along an N-supply gradient. KEY RESULTS: The LLS of neither 
      species showed a hump-shaped response along the N-supply gradient. Past studies 
      examining the LLS of an aquatic forb and terrestrial shrubs and trees along the 
      N-supply gradient (more than four levels of N supply) also refuted the hypothesis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The LLS of a single species exhibited neither an increase nor a 
      hump-shaped response to decreased N supply in a variety of life forms. Comparisons 
      at only a few N levels are misleading with regard to LLS response to N supply.

PG  - 1267-76
LID - 10.1007/s00442-014-2962-2 [doi]
AB  - Many prey species face trade-offs in the timing of life history switch points like 
      hatching and metamorphosis. Costs associated with transitioning early depend on the 
      biotic and abiotic conditions found in the subsequent life stage. The red-eyed 
      treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, faces risks from predators in multiple, successive 
      life stages, and can hatch early in response to mortality threats at the egg stage. 
      Here we tested how the consequences of life history plasticity, specifically early 
      hatching in response to terrestrial egg predators, depend on the assemblage of 
      aquatic larval predators. We predicted that diverse predator assemblages would 
      impose lower total predation pressure than the most effective single predator 
      species and might thereby reduce the costs of hatching early. We then conducted a 
      mesocosm experiment where we crossed hatchling phenotype (early vs. normal hatching) 
      with five larval-predator environments (no predators, either waterbugs, dragonflies, 
      or mosquitofish singly, or all three predator species together). The consequences of 
      hatching early varied across predator treatments, and tended to disappear through 
      time in some predation treatments, notably the waterbug and diverse predator 
      assemblages. We demonstrate that the fitness costs of life history plasticity in an 
      early life stage depend critically on the predator community composition in the next 
      stage.

AB  - Plasticity or evolution in behavioural responses are key attributes of successful 
      animal invasions. In northern Australia, the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) 
      recently invaded semi-arid regions. Here, cane toads endure repeated daily bouts of 
      severe desiccation and thermal stress during the long dry season (April-October). We 
      investigated whether cane toads have shifted their ancestral nocturnal rehydration 
      behaviour to one that exploits water resources during the day. Such a shift in 
      hydration behaviour could increase the fitness of individual toads by reducing 
      exposure to desiccation and thermal stress suffered during the day even within 
      terrestrial shelters. We used a novel method (acoustic tags) to monitor the daily 
      hydration behaviour of 20 toads at two artificial reservoirs on Camfield station, 
      Northern Territory. Remarkably, cane toads visited reservoirs to rehydrate during 
      daylight hours, with peaks in activity between 9.00 and 17.00. This diurnal pattern 
      of rehydration activity contrasts with nocturnal rehydration behaviour exhibited by 
      adult toads in their native geographical range and more mesic parts of Australia. 
      Our results demonstrate that cane toads phase shift a key behaviour to survive in a 
      harsh semi-arid landscape. Behavioural phase shifts have rarely been reported in 
      invasive species but could facilitate ongoing invasion success.

AB  - Azospirillum thiophilum BV-S(T), isolated from a sulfide spring, is a novel 
      nitrogen-fixing bacterium harboring sulfur-lithotrophy. In order to identify genetic 
      characteristics with habitat- and metabolic features contrasting to those from 
      terrestrial Azospirillum species, we present here the genome sequence of a novel 
      species A. thiophilum BV-S(T), with a significance of first genome report in the 
      aquatic Azospirillum species. The genome of strain BV-S(T) is comprised of 7.6Mb 
      chromosome with a GC content of 68.2%. This information will contribute to expand 
      understandings of sulfur-oxidizer microbes that preserve inherencies as a 
      diazotroph, and further it will provide insights into genome plasticity of the genus 
      Azospirillum for niche specific adaptations.

AB  - Human muscles, limbs and supporting ventilatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic 
      systems are well adapted for walking, and there is reasonable transfer of efficiency 
      of movement to bicycling. Our efficiency and economy of movement of bipedal walking 
      (≈30%) are far superior to those of apes. This overall body efficiency during 
      walking and bicycling represents the multiplicative interaction of a phosphorylative 
      coupling efficiency of ≈60%, and a mechanical coupling efficiency of ≈50%. These 
      coupling efficiencies compare well with those of other species adapted for 
      locomotion. We are capable runners, but our speed and power are inferior to 
      carnivorous and omnivorous terrestrial mammalian quadrupeds because of biomechanical 
      and physiological constraints. But, because of our metabolic plasticity (i.e., the 
      ability to switch among carbohydrate (CHO)- and lipid-derived energy sources) our 
      endurance capacity is very good by comparison to most mammals, but inferior to 
      highly adapted species such as wolves and migratory birds. Our ancestral ability for 
      hunting and gathering depends on strategy and capabilities in the areas of 
      thermoregulation, and metabolic plasticity. Clearly, our competitive advantage of 
      survival in the biosphere depends in intelligence and behavior. Today, those 
      abilities that served early hunter-gatherers make for interesting athletic 
      competitions due to wide variations in human phenotypes. In contemporary society, 
      the stresses of regular physical exercise serve to minimize morbidities and 
      mortality associated with physical inactivity, overnutrition, and aging.

AB  - Instruments and methods for normalization of energy-dependent gamma radiation survey 
      data to a less energy-dependent basis of measurement are evaluated based on relevant 
      field data collected at 15 different sites across the western United States along 
      with a site in Mongolia. Normalization performance is assessed relative to 
      measurements with a high-pressure ionization chamber (HPIC) due to its "flat" energy 
      response and accurate measurement of the true exposure rate from both cosmic and 
      terrestrial radiation. While analytically ideal for normalization applications, cost 
      and practicality disadvantages have increased demand for alternatives to the HPIC. 
      Regression analysis on paired measurements between energy-dependent sodium iodide 
      (NaI) scintillation detectors (5-cm by 5-cm crystal dimensions) and the HPIC 
      revealed highly consistent relationships among sites not previously impacted by 
      radiological contamination (natural sites). A resulting generalized data 
      normalization factor based on the average sensitivity of NaI detectors to naturally 
      occurring terrestrial radiation (0.56 nGy hHPIC per nGy hNaI), combined with the 
      calculated site-specific estimate of cosmic radiation, produced reasonably accurate 
      predictions of HPIC readings at natural sites. Normalization against two to 
      potential alternative instruments (a tissue-equivalent plastic scintillator and 
      energy-compensated NaI detector) did not perform better than the sensitivity 
      adjustment approach at natural sites. Each approach produced unreliable estimates of 
      HPIC readings at radiologically impacted sites, though normalization against the 
      plastic scintillator or energy-compensated NaI detector can address 
      incompatibilities between different energy-dependent instruments with respect to 
      estimation of soil radionuclide levels. The appropriate data normalization method 
      depends on the nature of the site, expected duration of the project, survey 
      objectives, and considerations of cost and practicality.

      of a pond-breeding amphibian.
PG  - 1071-1081
LID - 10.1007/s00442-021-04881-3 [doi]
AB  - Assessing carryover effects from the aquatic to the terrestrial stage of 
      pond-breeding amphibians is critical as temperature and hydrologic regimes of 
      temporary ponds continue to be altered as a result of climate change and other 
      stressors. We evaluated carryover effects of hydroperiod length (50-62 days) on 
      amphibian survival, developmental rates, and locomotor performance using a model 
      organism, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), through aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm 
      experiments with individual tests of locomotor performance. We found that shorter 
      hydroperiods (50 days) had low larval survival (0.44 ± 0.03) compared to the 62-day 
      hydroperiod (0.91 ± 0.09) and increased developmental rates, resulting in smaller 
      sizes at metamorphosis. We did not find evidence of carryover effects on terrestrial 
      survival three months post-metamorphosis with all hydroperiod treatments showing 
      high terrestrial survival (0.88 ± 0.07). However, post-metamorphic frogs from the 
      longer hydroperiod treatments grew faster and larger compared to individuals from 
      shortest hydroperiods and performed significantly better during endurance trials at 
      18 °C. Disentangling complex carryover effects across multiple life stages in 
      species with high phenotypic plasticity can shed light on the physiological capacity 
      of species to respond to changing environments and inform mechanistic predictions of 
      persistence in the face of anthropogenic stressors.

TI  - Extensive use of face masks during COVID-19 pandemic: (micro-)plastic pollution and 
      potential health concerns in the Arabian Peninsula.
PG  - 3181-3186
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.09.054 [doi]
AB  - Face masks are primary line of defense to reduce the transmission risk of severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). World Health Organization 
      (WHO) has already updated the guidelines and advised the use of face masks in public 
      areas essentially. This has dramatically increased the production and use of face 
      masks in many parts of the world. Arabian Peninsula is comprised of six countries 
      where the public perception of following WHO guidelines is high. In this study, we 
      highlight the concerns relating to extensive use of face masks in this region, 
      particularly in the context of (micro-)plastic pollution. We computed the number of 
      face masks to be used in each of the countries of Arabian Peninsula for varying 
      levels of acceptance rate and average number of daily usages. Accordingly, the 
      amount of (micro-)plastic that could come into the terrestrial and marine 
      environment is also reported. Saudi Arabia, being the most populated country in the 
      region may contribute up to 32-235 thousand tons of (micro-)plastic which is nearly 
      half of the amount in the whole Peninsula. On the other hand, an extremely high 
      infection rate in Qatar (25.74%) may also lead to a significant increase of 
      (micro-)plastic content due to high public acceptance rate and living standards. The 
      high (micro-)plastic fraction is of significant concern because it ends up in the 
      marine ecosystems. Further, it allows colonization of several pathogenic 
      microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungal filaments, and spores) and might serve as 
      carriers of disease transmission finally affecting the living organisms habituating 
      these ecosystems. It is suggested that appropriate regulations on face masks waste 
      should be devised to avoid any unwanted consequences in the near future.

LID - e98485
AB  - Accumulation of anthropogenic litter (i.e. garbage; AL) and its ecosystem effects in 
      marine environments are well documented. Rivers receive AL from terrestrial habitats 
      and represent a major source of AL to marine environments, but AL is rarely studied 
      within freshwater ecosystems. Our objectives were to 1) quantify AL density in urban 
      freshwaters, 2) compare AL abundance among freshwater, terrestrial, and marine 
      ecosystems, and 3) characterize the activity and composition of AL biofilms in 
      freshwater habitats. We quantified AL from the Chicago River and Chicago's Lake 
      Michigan shoreline, and found that AL abundance in Chicago freshwater ecosystems was 
      comparable to previously reported data for marine and terrestrial ecosystems, 
      although AL density and composition differed among habitats. To assess microbial 
      interactions with AL, we incubated AL and natural substrates in 3 freshwater 
      ecosystems, quantified biofilm metabolism as gross primary production (GPP) and 
      community respiration (CR), and characterized biofilm bacterial community 
      composition via high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The main driver of 
      biofilm community composition was incubation location (e.g., river vs pond), but 
      there were some significant differences in biofilm composition and metabolism among 
      substrates. For example, biofilms on organic substrates (cardboard and leaves) had 
      lower GPP than hard substrates (glass, plastic, aluminum and tiles). In addition, 
      bacterial communities on organic substrates were distinct in composition from those 
      on hard substrates, with higher relative abundances of bacteria associated with 
      cellulose decomposition. Finally, we used our results to develop a conceptual 
      diagram designed to unite the study of AL in terrestrial and freshwater environments 
      with the well-established field of marine debris research. We suggest this broad 
      perspective will be useful for future studies which synthesize AL sources, ecosystem 
      effects, and fate across multiple ecosystem types, and will benefit management and 
      reduction of global AL accumulations.

AB  - Sharing of positive or negative regulators between multiple targets is frequently 
      observed in cellular signaling cascades. For instance, phosphatase sharing between 
      multiple kinases is ubiquitous within the MAPK pathway. Here we investigate how such 
      phosphatase sharing could shape robustness and evolvability of the phosphorylation 
      cascade. Through modeling and evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that 1) 
      phosphatase sharing dramatically increases robustness of a bistable MAPK response, 
      and 2) phosphatase-sharing cascades evolve faster than nonsharing cascades. This 
      faster evolution is particularly pronounced when evolving from a monostable toward a 
      bistable phenotype, whereas the transition speed of a population from a bistable to 
      monostable response is not affected by phosphatase sharing. This property may enable 
      the phosphatase-sharing design to adapt better in a changing environment. Analysis 
      of the respective mutational landscapes reveal that phosphatase sharing reduces the 
      number of limiting mutations required for transition from monostable to bistable 
      responses, hence facilitating a faster transition to such response types. Taken 
      together, using MAPK cascade as an example, our study offers a general theoretical 
      framework to explore robustness and evolutionary plasticity of signal transduction 
      cascades.

      experiments focusing on post-natal development are scant. Documented effects of heat 
      waves on whole-body metabolism may reflect changes in mitochondrial function, but 
      most studies do not measure physiological traits at both the cellular and whole 
      organism levels. Here, we exposed nests of zebra finches to experimentally simulated 
      heat waves for 18 days after hatching and measured body mass, growth rate, 
      whole-body metabolic rate, body temperature, wet thermal conductance, evaporative 
      water loss, and relative water economy of chicks at three ages corresponding to 
      ectothermic (day 5), poikilothermic (day 12), and homoeothermic (day 50) stages. 
      Additionally, we measured mitochondrial bioenergetics of blood cells 80 days 
      post-hatch. While early-life exposure to heat wave conditions did not impact whole 
      body metabolic and hygric physiology, body temperature was lower for birds from 
      heated compared with control nests at both 12 and 50 days of age. There was also an 
      effect of nest heating at the cellular level, with mitochondria from heated birds 
      having higher endogenous and proton-leak related respiration, although oxidative 
      phosphorylation, maximum respiratory capacity, and coupling efficiency were not 
      impacted. Our results suggest that early-life exposure to high ambient temperature 
      induces programming effects on cellular-level and thermal physiology that may not be 
      apparent for whole-animal metabolism.

AB  - The environment experienced by developing organisms can shape the timing and 
      character of developmental processes, generating different phenotypes from the same 
      genotype, each with different probabilities of survival and performance as adults. 
      Chordates have two basic modes of development, indirect and direct. Species with 
      indirect development, which includes most fishes and amphibians, have a complex life 
      cycle with a free-swimming larva that is typically a growth stage, followed by a 
      metamorphosis into the adult form. Species with direct development, which is an 
      evolutionarily derived developmental mode, develop directly from embryo to the 
      juvenile without an intervening larval stage. Among the best studied species with 
      complex life cycles are the amphibians, especially the anurans (frogs and toads). 
      Amphibian tadpoles are exposed to diverse biotic and abiotic factors in their 
      developmental habitat. They have extensive capacity for developmental plasticity, 
      which can lead to the expression of different, adaptive morphologies as tadpoles 
      (polyphenism), variation in the timing of and size at metamorphosis, and carry-over 
      effects on the phenotype of the juvenile/adult. The neuroendocrine stress axis plays 
      a pivotal role in mediating environmental effects on amphibian development. Before 
      initiating metamorphosis, if tadpoles are exposed to predators they upregulate 
      production of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), which acts directly on the 
      tail to cause it to grow, thereby increasing escape performance. When tadpoles reach 
      a minimum body size to initiate metamorphosis they can vary the timing of 
      transformation in relation to growth opportunity or mortality risk in the larval 
      habitat. They do this by modulating the production of thyroid hormone (TH), the 
      primary inducer of metamorphosis, and CORT, which synergizes with TH to promote 
      tissue transformation. Hypophysiotropic neurons that release the stress neurohormone 
      corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) are activated in response to environmental 
      stress (e.g., pond drying, food restriction, etc.), and CRF accelerates 
      metamorphosis by directly inducing secretion of pituitary thyrotropin and 
      corticotropin, thereby increasing secretion of TH and CORT. Although activation of 
      the neuroendocrine stress axis promotes immediate survival in a deteriorating larval 
      habitat, costs may be incurred such as reduced tadpole growth and size at 
      metamorphosis. Small size at transformation can impair performance of the adult, 
      reducing probability of survival in the terrestrial habitat, or fecundity. 
      Furthermore, elevations in CORT in the tadpole caused by environmental stressors 
      cause long term, stable changes in neuroendocrine function, behavior and physiology 
      of the adult, which can affect fitness. Comparative studies show that the roles of 
      stress hormones in developmental plasticity are conserved across vertebrate taxa 
      including humans.

AB  - Generalist species can potentially exploit a wide variety of resources, but at the 
      individual level they often show a certain degree of foraging specialization. 
      Specific foraging strategies, however, may increase exposure to environmental 
      contaminants that can alter the cost-benefit balance of consuming particular food 
      items. The Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) is known to opportunistically 
      feed on a wide range of marine and terrestrial prey that differ in contaminant load, 
      such as mercury (Hg) that strongly biomagnifies through the aquatic food web. The 
      hypothesis tested in this study were: i) a predominant use of marine prey by females 
      during egg-formation and by both parents during chick rearing increases the exposure 
      to Hg during embryonic development and chick growth, and ii) this affects parental 
      investment in clutch volume, chick growth and body condition. Total Hg burden and 
      isotopic signatures of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) were determined for 
      eggs, down feathers, and primary feathers of L. fuscus chicks collected at a coastal 
      colony in Belgium. As expected, eggs and feathers of chicks from parents with a 
      stable isotope signature that suggested a predominantly marine diet had higher 
      levels of Hg. The use of marine resources by females during the egg-formation period 
      positively correlated to maternal investment in egg size, though entailing the cost 
      of increased Hg-concentrations which in turn negatively affected clutch volume. 
      Furthermore, it is shown that the use of chick down feathers is a suitable matrix to 
      non-lethally estimate Hg concentrations in eggs. Contrary to our expectations, no 
      relationship between Hg exposure and chick growth or chick body condition was found, 
      which may be due the low concentrations found. We conclude that currently Hg 
      contamination does not constitute a risk for development and condition of L. fuscus 
      offspring at the levels currently observed at the Belgian coast.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in brain plasticity and brain repair. In 
      mammals, it is mostly restricted to specific brain regions and specific 
      physiological functions. The function and evolutionary history of mammalian adult 
      neurogenesis has been elusive so far. The largest neurogenic site in mammals 
      (subventricular zone, SVZ) generates neurons destined to populate the olfactory 
      bulb. The SVZ neurogenic activity appears to be related to the dependence of the 
      species on olfaction since it occurs at high rates throughout life in animals 
      strongly dependent on this function for their survival. Indeed, it dramatically 
      decreases in humans, who do not depend so much on it. This study investigates 
      whether the SVZ neurogenic site exists in mammals devoid of olfaction and olfactory 
      brain structures, such as dolphins. Our results demonstate that a small SVZ-like 
      region persists in these aquatic mammals. However, this region seems to have lost 
      its neurogenic capabilities since neonatal stages. In addition, instead of the 
      typical newly generated neuroblasts, some mature neurons were observed in the 
      dolphin SVZ. Since cetaceans evolved from terrestrial ancestors, non-neurogenic SVZ 
      may indicate extinction of adult neurogenesis in the absence of olfactory function, 
      with the retention of an SVZ-like anatomical region either vestigial or of still 
      unknown role.

LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically characterize intra-limb patterns of skeletal 
      plasticity to loading among living women, in order to better understand regional 
      complexity in structural adaptation within the lower limb and more accurately infer 
      behavior in the past. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used peripheral quantitative 
      computed tomography imaging of the femur, tibia, first and second metatarsals to 
      quantify bone morphology among female controls and athletes representative of either 
      terrestrial or marine mobility, grouped by loading category (odd-impact, repetitive 
      low-impact, and high-magnitude). Parameters included midshaft bone density, areas, 
      rigidity, and shape, epiphyseal bone densities and areas. We assessed between-group 
      differences and the influence of training history on significant variation among the 
      loading groups. RESULTS: Terrestrial mobility strategies were best distinguished by 
      significant midshaft periosteal hypertrophy across the lower limb/foot relative to 
      controls, and by particularly high midshaft femoral and tibial cortical bone areas 
      relative to rowers. Enhanced midshaft bone area was typically paired with decreased 
      bone density among athlete groups. Sport-specific variation in training 
      duration/timing was significantly correlated with multiple midshaft parameters. 
      DISCUSSION: Results demonstrate characteristic patterns of intra-limb adaptation to 
      terrestrial and marine mobility strategies among active women relative to controls, 
      and highlight components of these patterns that may be shaped in part by differences 
      in loading duration/timing. Additionally, our findings support constraints on 
      skeletal variation in the distal tibia and foot relative to more proximal locations 
      about the knee among living women. For example, metatarsal variation was 
      constrained, but where present reflected sport-specific variation in force 
      distribution in the foot.

AB  - Evolutionary transitions from terrestrial to aquatic life modify selective forces on 
      an animal's coloration. For example, light penetrates differently through water than 
      air, and a new suite of predators and visual backgrounds changes the targets of 
      selection. We suggest that an aquatic animal's coloration may also affect its 
      susceptibility to algal fouling. In a colour-polymorphic field population of 
      seasnakes (Emydocephalus annulatus) in New Caledonia, black individuals supported 
      higher algal cover than did banded conspecifics. In experimental tests, black snake 
      models (plastic tubes) accumulated more algae than did banded models. Algal cover 
      substantially reduced snake activity (in the field) and swimming speeds (in the 
      laboratory). Effects of algal cover on a snake's hydrodynamic efficiency and/or its 
      rate of cutaneous gas exchange thus may impose selection on the colours of aquatic 
      organisms.

AB  - Bisphenol A (2,2-bis[4-hydroxyphenyl]propane, BPA), the monomer used to produce 
      polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, is weakly estrogenic and therefore of 
      environmental and human health interest. Due to the high production volumes and 
      disposal of products made from BPA, polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, BPA has 
      entered terrestrial and aquatic environments. In the presence of oxygen, diverse 
      taxa of bacteria, fungi, algae and even higher plants metabolize BPA, but anaerobic 
      microbial degradation has not been documented. Recent reports demonstrated that 
      abiotic processes mediate BPA transformation and mineralization in the absence of 
      oxygen, indicating that BPA is susceptible to degradation under anoxic conditions. 
      This review summarizes biological and nonbiological processes that lead to BPA 
      transformation and degradation, and identifies research needs to advance predictive 
      understanding of the longevity of BPA and its transformation products in 
      environmental systems.

TI  - Postsynaptic calcium contributes to reinforcement in a three-neuron network 
      exhibiting associative plasticity.
PG  - 227-33
AB  - We show that activation of a single serotonergic cell is sufficient to trigger 
      long-term associative enhancement of synaptic input to the withdrawal interneuron in 
      a simple network consisting of three interconnected identified cells in the nervous 
      system of terrestrial snail Helix. 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) 
      Ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) injection in the postsynaptic neuron 
      abolishes the pairing-specific enhancement of synaptic input. Activation of a single 
      modulatory cell that we used to reinforce the synaptic input induced an increase of 
      the intracellular [Ca2+] in the ipsilateral withdrawal interneuron without any 
      changes of its membrane potential or input resistance. Similar changes in 
      intracellular [Ca2+] were observed in the same withdrawal interneuron under bath 
      application of 10(-5) m serotonin. Responses to repeated glutamate applications to 
      the soma of synaptically isolated withdrawal interneurons increased after 10 min of 
      serotonin or thapsigargin bath application, but were absent in conditions of 
      preliminary BAPTA intracellular injection, significantly decreased under heparin 
      injection. Thus, activity of a single modulatory cell may mediate reinforcement via 
      an increase of [Ca2+] in the postsynaptic cell in a simple network consisting of 
      neurons with defined behavioural roles.

TI  - Oscillations and gaseous oxides in invertebrate olfaction.
PG  - 110-22
AB  - Olfactory systems combine an extraordinary molecular sensitivity with robust 
      synaptic plasticity. Central neuronal circuits that perform pattern recognition in 
      olfaction typically discriminate between hundreds of molecular species and form 
      associations between odor onsets and behavioral contingencies that can last a 
      lifetime. Two design features in the olfactory system of the terrestrial mollusk 
      Limax maximus may be common elements of olfactory systems that display the twin 
      features of broad molecular sensitivity and rapid odor learning: spatially coherent 
      oscillations in the second-order circuitry that receives sensory input; and 
      involvement of the interneuronal messengers nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide 
      (CO) in sensory responses and circuit dynamics of the oscillating olfactory network. 
      The principal odor processing center in Limax, the procerebrum (PC) of the cerebral 
      ganglion, contains on the order of 10(5) local interneurons and receives both direct 
      and processed input from olfactory receptors. Field potential recordings in the PC 
      show an oscillation at approximately 0.7 Hz that is altered by odor input. Optical 
      recordings of voltage changes in local regions of the PC show waves of 
      depolarization that originate at the distal pole and propagate to the base of the 
      PC. Weak odor stimulation transiently switches PC activity from a propagating mode 
      to a spatially uniform mode. The field potential oscillation in the PC lobe depends 
      on intercellular communication via NO, based on opposing effects of reagents that 
      decrease or increase NO levels in the PC. Inhibition of NO synthase slows the field 
      potential oscillation, while application of exogenous NO increases the oscillation 
      frequency. A role for CO in PC dynamics is suggested by experiments in which CO 
      liberation increases the PC oscillation frequency. These design features of the 
      Limax PC lobe odor processing circuitry may relate to synaptic plasticity that 
      subserves both connection of new receptors throughout the life of the slug and its 
      highly developed odor learning ability.

TI  - Fire coral clones demonstrate phenotypic plasticity among reef habitats.
PG  - 3860-3869
LID - 10.1111/mec.14165 [doi]
AB  - Clonal populations are often characterized by reduced levels of genotypic diversity, 
      which can translate into lower numbers of functional phenotypes, both of which 
      impede adaptation. Study of partially clonal animals enables examination of the 
      environmental settings under which clonal reproduction is favoured. Here, we 
      gathered genotypic and phenotypic information from 3,651 georeferenced colonies of 
      the fire coral Millepora platyphylla in five habitats with different hydrodynamic 
      regimes in Moorea, French Polynesia. In the upper slope where waves break, most 
      colonies grew as vertical sheets ("sheet tree") making them more vulnerable to 
      fragmentation. Nearly all fire corals in the other habitats are encrusting or 
      massive. The M. platyphylla population is highly clonal (80% of the colonies are 
      clones), while characterized by the highest genotype diversity ever documented for 
      terrestrial or marine populations (1,064 genotypes). The proportion of clones varies 
      greatly among habitats (≥58%-97%) and clones (328 clonal lineages) are distributed 
      perpendicularly from the reef crest, perfectly aligned with wave energy. There are 
      six clonal lineages with clones dispersed in at least two adjacent habitats that 
      strongly demonstrate phenotypic plasticity. Eighty per cent of the colonies in these 
      lineages are "sheet tree" on the upper slope, while 80%-100% are encrusting or 
      massive on the mid slope and back reef. This is a unique example of phenotypic 
      plasticity among reef-building coral clones as corals typically have wave-tolerant 
      growth forms in high-energy reef areas.

TI  - Impairment of context memory by beta-amyloid peptide in terrestrial snail.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.3389/neuro.08/003.2008 [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - We examined influence of the beta-amyloid peptide (betaAP) (25-35) neurotoxic 
      fragment on Helix lucorum food-aversion learning. Testing with aversively 
      conditioned carrot showed that 2, 5 and 14 days after training the betaAP-injected 
      group responded in a significantly larger number of cases and with a significantly 
      smaller latency than the sham-injected control group. The results demonstrate that 
      the AP partially impairs the learning process. In an attempt to specify what 
      component of memory is impaired we compared responses in a context in which the 
      snails were aversively trained, and in a neutral context. It was found that the 
      sham-injected learned snails significantly less frequently took the aversively 
      conditioned food in the context in which the snails were shocked, while the 
      betaAP-injected snails remembered the aversive context 2 days after associative 
      training, but were not able to distinguish two contexts 5, and 14 days after 
      training. In a separate series of experiments a specific context was associated with 
      electric shock, and changes in general responsiveness were tested in two contexts 
      several days later. It was found that the betaAP-injected snails significantly 
      increased withdrawal responses in all tested contexts, while the sham-injected 
      control animals selectively increased responsiveness only in the context in which 
      they were reinforced with electric shocks. These results demonstrate that the betaAP 
      (25-35) interferes with the learning process, and may play a significant role in 
      behavioral plasticity and memory by selectively impairing only one component of 
      memory - the context memory.

TI  - Synchronous and Non-Synchronous Semelparity in Sibling Species of Pulmonates.
PG  - 372-7
LID - 10.2108/zs150020 [doi]
AB  - Diverse life histories have been documented in terrestrial pulmonates, which inhabit 
      different regions in climate. Life history traits are often phenotypically plastic 
      and vary depending on the environment. Thus, surveys using designs that control for 
      the confounding effects of environment are needed to evaluate the evolutionary 
      differences between populations of closely related species in the wild. We examined 
      the life histories of sibling species of terrestrial pulmonate within two regions of 
      similar climates. Bradybaena pellucida (BP) is endemic to Japanese islands, and has 
      recently been expanding its distribution northeastward, whereas B. similaris (BS) 
      has been introduced by humans into temperate and tropical regions worldwide. We 
      found that these species exhibit discrete differences in population dynamics and 
      life cycle, despite their close relatedness. The annual life cycle of BP is 
      synchronized among individuals in a population. Thus, BP is univoltine with 
      discontinuous generation. In contrast, BS individuals do not synchronize their 
      growth or reproduction, and thus exhibit overlapping generations. Our results 
      indicate that synchronized and non-synchronized population dynamics diverge 
      relatively rapidly in semelparous pulmonates. This type of difference has not been 
      documented in pulmonate life history, and may have been overlooked because only a 
      few studies have explicitly compared life cycles of closely related species within 
      the same climate. Our results provide a basis for further studies of life history 
      evolution in pulmonates.

TI  - Biomechanical control of beech pole verticality (Fagus sylvatica) before and after 
      thinning: theoretical modelling and ground-truth data using terrestrial LiDAR.
PG  - 187-198
LID - 10.1002/ajb2.1228 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Thinning is a frequent disturbance in managed forests, 
      especially to increase radial growth. Due to buckling and bending risk associated 
      with height and mass growth, tree verticality is strongly constrained in slender 
      trees growing in dense forests and poor light conditions. Tree verticality is 
      controlled by uprighting movements implemented from local curvatures induced by wood 
      maturation stresses and/or eccentric radial growth. This study presents the first 
      attempt to compare the real uprighting movements in mature trees using a theoretical 
      model of posture control. METHODS: Stem lean and curvature were measured by 
      Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS) technology before and 6 years after thinning and 
      compared to unthinned control poles. Measures for several tree and wood traits were 
      pooled together to implement a widely used biomechanical model of tree posture 
      control. Changes in observed stem lean were then compared with the model 
      predictions, and discrepancies were reviewed. KEY RESULTS: Even under a highly 
      constrained environment, most control poles were able to counterbalance 
      gravitational curvature and avoid sagging. Thinning stimulated uprighting movements. 
      The theoretical uprighting curvature rate increased just after thinning, then slowed 
      after 2 years, likely due to the stem diameter increase. The biomechanical model 
      overestimated the magnitude of uprighting. CONCLUSIONS: Most suppressed beech poles 
      maintain a constant lean angle, and uprighting movements occur after thinning, 
      indicating that stem lean is plastic in response to light conditions. Acclimation of 
      posture control to other changes in growth condition should be investigated, and 
      lean angles should be measured in forest inventories as an indicator of future wood 
      quality.

TI  - Phototropic growth in a reef flat acroporid branching coral species.
PG  - 662-7
LID - 10.1242/jeb.022624 [doi]
AB  - Many terrestrial plants form complex morphological structures and will alter these 
      growth patterns in response to light direction. Similarly reef building corals have 
      high morphological variation across coral families, with many species also 
      displaying phenotypic plasticity across environmental gradients. In particular, the 
      colony geometry in branching corals is altered by the frequency, location and 
      direction of branch initiation and growth. This study demonstrates that for the 
      branching species Acropora pulchra, light plays a key role in axial polyp 
      differentiation and therefore axial corallite development--the basis for new branch 
      formation. A. pulchra branches exhibited a directional growth response, with axial 
      corallites only developing when light was available, and towards the incident light. 
      Field experimentation revealed that there was a light intensity threshold of 45 
      micromol m(-2) s(-1), below which axial corallites would not develop and this 
      response was blue light (408-508 nm) dependent. There was a twofold increase in 
      axial corallite growth above this light intensity threshold and a fourfold increase 
      in axial corallite growth under the blue light treatment. These features of coral 
      branch growth are highly reminiscent of the initiation of phototropic branch growth 
      in terrestrial plants, which is directed by the blue light component of sunlight.

TI  - Comparative aspects of gait, scaling and mechanics in mammals.
PG  - 121-33
AB  - In phylogenetically based systematics, Mammalia is the nomenclatural term which 
      designates the clade stemming from the most recent common ancestry of monotremes and 
      theria [, Sys. Biol. 43 (1994) 497]. Considering that locomotor performance is a 
      prevalent function to provide the necessary conditions to survive and transmit 
      genes, it may be questioned if the diverse types of locomotion exhibited by extant 
      mammals could have played a role in their evolution, or have only followed it. We 
      may look after the structural and behavioural features which are involved in mammal 
      locomotion compared to other tetrapods and test if they fit with the proposed 
      phylogeny. Several factors may be checked: scaling effect in relation to 
      gravitational constraints; geometrical distribution of masses in the body, and 
      relative mechanical role of the limbs in the production of the external forces 
      necessary to forward motion. Classically, it was thought that the fastest gaits used 
      by terrestrial mammals were based upon a unique kind of limb motion co-ordination, 
      called asymmetrical gaits, which in turn may be thought to be related to a peculiar 
      neuronal wiring. Kinematic analysis brings an insight to this topic. Is the search 
      for an ancestral mammalian locomotor pattern judicious? Notice the small size of 
      many of the first mammals and their probable locomotor plasticity. (relation between 
      grain size of the elements within the substrate and the organism scale). At a small 
      size, the gravitational constraint is less important, and the distinction between 
      terrestrial and arboreal has probably no sense when the limbs are the principal 
      motor elements. There remains the importance of the geometrical distribution of body 
      elements, the proportions of the limbs and of the head-neck complex, the tail merely 
      as an appendix, a set of factors which may have generated the frame of constraints 
      within which diverse locomotor modes have evolved.

TI  - Brain size is not correlated with forelimb dexterity in fissiped carnivores 
      (Carnivora): A comparative test of the principle of proper mass.
PG  - 167-80
AB  - To test the hypothesis that brain size and forelimb dexterity are positively 
      correlated, the relative brain size of 41 species of fissiped (terrestrial) 
      carnivores (Order: Carnivora) was examined with respect to their forelimb use during 
      feeding. With the use of a newly derived dexterity index, the forelimb dexterity 
      executed by each of the species was calculated as a single, continuous variable 
      which was then regressed against the residuals of brain size. To account for 
      confounding effects of phylogenetic inertia, the analysis was performed with 
      independent contrasts analysis using a speciational model of evolutionary change 
      (i.e. equal branch lengths). The results suggest that relative brain size and 
      isocortex size are not correlated with the dexterity of the proximal or distal 
      segments or a combination of the two (total forelimb dexterity). The presence of 
      species with widely different brain sizes and similar dexterities, and vice versa, 
      suggests that an increase in the amount of neural substrate might not be necessary 
      for the production of finely coordinated forelimb movements. It is suggested that 
      this outcome is representative of the plasticity of both mammalian brain size and 
      behavior and that variations in brain size and forelimb dexterity could be linked to 
      disparate ecological and phylogenetic factors which act in concert to promote or 
      constrain neural development and behavior in different species.

TI  - How to recover from a bad start: size at metamorphosis affects growth and survival 
      in a tropical amphibian.
PG  - 24

AB  - BACKGROUND: In species with complex life cycles, size at metamorphosis is a key 
      life-history trait which reflects the complex interactions between costs and 
      benefits of life in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Whereas the effects of 
      a deteriorating larval habitat (e.g. pond desiccation) on triggering an early 
      metamorphosis have been extensively investigated in amphibians, the consequences of 
      the resulting reduced size at metamorphosis on fitness in the post-metamorphic 
      terrestrial stage remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that a smaller 
      size at metamorphosis negatively affects performance and survival in the ensuing 
      terrestrial stage. Using as model a tropical amphibian (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) 
      showing a large phenotypic plasticity in metamorphosing traits, we evaluated the 
      effects of size at metamorphosis on fitness-related trophic and locomotor 
      performance traits, as well as on growth and survival rates. RESULTS: Our results 
      support the hypothesis that a larger size at metamorphosis is correlated with better 
      survival and performance. The survival rate of large metamorphosing individuals was 
      95%, compared to 60% for those completing metamorphosis at a small size. Locomotor 
      performance and gape size were positively correlated with body size, larger animals 
      being more mobile and capable to ingest larger prey. However, smaller individuals 
      achieved higher growth rates, thus reducing the size gap. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, size 
      at metamorphosis affected profoundly the chances of survival in the short term, but 
      smaller surviving individuals partly compensated their initial disadvantages by 
      increasing growth rates.

PG  - 853-6
AB  - Phosphorylation of CREB transcription factor and expression of the immediate early 
      gene c-fos in the brains of vertebrates play a key role in the molecular genetic 
      mechanisms of long-term neuronal plasticity. The present study identifies the 
      conditions for immunohistochemical detection of pCREB and c-Fos in the nervous 
      system of the mollusk Helix lucorum (Pulmonata: Stylommatophora); activation of 
      these transcription factors was demonstrated after administration of the convulsive 
      agent pentylenetetrazole. Basal pCREB and c-Fos levels in the central nervous system 
      of intact animals were low. Injection of pentylenetetrazole at a dose of 600 mg/kg 
      evoked characteristic stereotypical motor responses, along with sharp reductions in 
      the phosphorylation of CREB1 and expression of the immediate early gene c-fos, this 
      also occurring in identified neurons. Double immunofluorescent labeling of pCREB and 
      c-Fos showed that expression of c-Fos transcription factor was seen only in 
      pCREB-immunoreactive neurons. These data provide evidence that activation of pCREB 
      and c-Fos transcription factors can be used as molecular markers for mapping the 
      processes of neuronal plasticity in the nervous systems of mollusks.

TI  - Fluctuating environments during early development can limit adult phenotypic 
      flexibility: insights from an amphibious fish.
LID - jeb228304 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.228304 [doi]
AB  - The interaction between developmental plasticity and the capacity for reversible 
      acclimation (phenotypic flexibility) is poorly understood, particularly in organisms 
      exposed to fluctuating environments. We used an amphibious killifish (Kryptolebias 
      marmoratus) to test the hypotheses that organisms reared in fluctuating environments 
      (i) will make no developmental changes to suit any one environment because fixing 
      traits to suit one environment could be maladaptive for another, and (ii) will be 
      highly phenotypically flexible as adults because their early life experiences 
      predict high environmental variability in the future. We reared fish under constant 
      (water) or fluctuating (water-air) environments until adulthood and assessed a suite 
      of traits along the oxygen cascade (e.g. neuroepithelial cell density and size, 
      cutaneous capillarity, gill morphology, ventricle size, red muscle morphometrics, 
      terrestrial locomotor performance). To evaluate the capacity for phenotypic 
      flexibility, a subset of adult fish from each rearing condition was then air-exposed 
      for 14 days before the same traits were measured. In support of the developmental 
      plasticity hypothesis, traits involved with O(2) sensing and uptake were largely 
      unaffected by water-air fluctuations during early life, but we found marked 
      developmental changes in traits related to O(2) transport, utilization and locomotor 
      performance. In contrast, we found no evidence supporting the phenotypic flexibility 
      hypothesis. Adult fish from both rearing conditions exhibited the same degree of 
      phenotypic flexibility in various O(2) sensing- and uptake-related traits. In other 
      cases, water-air fluctuations attenuated adult phenotypic flexibility despite the 
      fact that phenotypic flexibility is hypothesized to be favoured when environments 
      fluctuate. Overall, we conclude that exposure to environmental fluctuations during 
      development in K. marmoratus can dramatically alter the constitutive adult 
      phenotype, as well as diminish the scope for phenotypic flexibility in later life.

TI  - Long-term study of a subdioecious Populus ×canescens family reveals sex lability of 
      females and reproduction behaviour of cosexual plants.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1007/s00497-019-00378-5 [doi]
AB  - Cosexual Populus ×canescens plants are inconstant females with life course 
      plasticity of sex phenotype and can reproduce by selfing. Populus species are 
      dioecious, but deviations from dioecy are reported in some cases. The objectives of 
      this study were to investigate the phenotypic expression and the inheritance of 
      subdioecy in a Populus ×canescens pedigree. The F(1) progeny was monitored for sex 
      during 14 years. Thirty per cent of individuals expressed deviations from dioecy and 
      long-term plasticity of sex. Some plants started flowering as male, then became 
      cosexual, and finally turned female. Two cosexual individuals were self-pollinated 
      and generated a selfed progeny markedly impaired by inbreeding depression, but able 
      to reproduce by outcrossing. Sex segregation of the F(1) progeny statistically 
      fitted the expected ratio 1:2:1 (female:male:cosexual). By analysis of DNA markers, 
      the cosexual individuals were genetically clustered with the females. The 
      segregation ratio and the genetic profile indicated that cosexual plants were female 
      with altered sex phenotype. Linkage analysis identified a putative sex-determining 
      region with suppressed recombination on chromosome 19 of the male Populus tremula 
      parent. The male sex trait was linked to the pericentromeric region of the P. 
      tremula chromosome 19, whereas the cosexual trait was linked to chromosome 19 of the 
      female Populus alba parent. A genetic model is proposed to explain inheritance and 
      phenotypic expression of sex.

TI  - Biotic and environmental dynamics through the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous 
      transition: evidence for protracted faunal and ecological turnover.
PG  - 776-814
LID - 10.1111/brv.12255 [doi]
AB  - The Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous interval represents a time of environmental 
      upheaval and cataclysmic events, combined with disruptions to terrestrial and marine 
      ecosystems. Historically, the Jurassic/Cretaceous (J/K) boundary was classified as 
      one of eight mass extinctions. However, more recent research has largely overturned 
      this view, revealing a much more complex pattern of biotic and abiotic dynamics than 
      has previously been appreciated. Here, we present a synthesis of our current 
      knowledge of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous events, focusing particularly on events 
      closest to the J/K boundary. We find evidence for a combination of short-term 
      catastrophic events, large-scale tectonic processes and environmental perturbations, 
      and major clade interactions that led to a seemingly dramatic faunal and ecological 
      turnover in both the marine and terrestrial realms. This is coupled with a great 
      reduction in global biodiversity which might in part be explained by poor sampling. 
      Very few groups appear to have been entirely resilient to this J/K boundary 'event', 
      which hints at a 'cascade model' of ecosystem changes driving faunal dynamics. 
      Within terrestrial ecosystems, larger, more-specialised organisms, such as 
      saurischian dinosaurs, appear to have suffered the most. Medium-sized tetanuran 
      theropods declined, and were replaced by larger-bodied groups, and basal eusauropods 
      were replaced by neosauropod faunas. The ascent of paravian theropods is emphasised 
      by escalated competition with contemporary pterosaur groups, culminating in the 
      explosive radiation of birds, although the timing of this is obfuscated by biases in 
      sampling. Smaller, more ecologically diverse terrestrial non-archosaurs, such as 
      lissamphibians and mammaliaforms, were comparatively resilient to extinctions, 
      instead documenting the origination of many extant groups around the J/K boundary. 
      In the marine realm, extinctions were focused on low-latitude, shallow marine 
      shelf-dwelling faunas, corresponding to a significant eustatic sea-level fall in the 
      latest Jurassic. More mobile and ecologically plastic marine groups, such as 
      ichthyosaurs, survived the boundary relatively unscathed. High rates of extinction 
      and turnover in other macropredaceous marine groups, including plesiosaurs, are 
      accompanied by the origin of most major lineages of extant sharks. Groups which 
      occupied both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, including crocodylomorphs, document 
      a selective extinction in shallow marine forms, whereas turtles appear to have 
      diversified. These patterns suggest that different extinction selectivity and 
      ecological processes were operating between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, which 
      were ultimately important in determining the fates of many key groups, as well as 
      the origins of many major extant lineages. We identify a series of potential abiotic 
      candidates for driving these patterns, including multiple bolide impacts, several 
      episodes of flood basalt eruptions, dramatic climate change, and major disruptions 
      to oceanic systems. The J/K transition therefore, although not a mass extinction, 
      represents an important transitional period in the co-evolutionary history of life 
      on Earth.

AB  - In salt marshes, the alternation of low and high tides entails rapid shifts of 
      submersion and aerial exposure for terrestrial communities. In these intertidal 
      environments, terrestrial species have to deal with an osmotic loss in body water 
      content and an increase in sodium chloride concentration when salt load increases. 
      In salt marshes, spiders represent an abundant arthropod group, whose physiological 
      ecology in response to variations of soil salinity must be further investigated. In 
      this study, we compared the effect of salinity on the survival and physiology of 
      three species of Lycosidae; two salt marsh species (Arctosa fulvolineata and Pardosa 
      purbeckensis) and one forest species (P. saltans). Spiders were individually exposed 
      at three salinity conditions (0‰, 35‰ and 70‰) and survival, changes in body water 
      content, hemolymph ions (Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), K(+); ICP-MS technique) and 
      metabolites (mainly amino acids, polyols, sugars; LC and GC techniques) were 
      assessed. The survival of the forest species P. saltans was very quickly hampered at 
      moderate and high salinities. In this spider, variations of hemolymph ions and 
      metabolites revealed a quick loss of physiological homeostasis and a rapid 
      salt-induced dehydration of the specimens. Conversely, high survival durations were 
      measured in the two salt-marsh spiders, and more particularly in A. fulvolineata. In 
      both P. purbeckensis and A. fulvolineata, the proportion of Na(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), 
      K(+) remained constant at the three experimental conditions. Accumulation of 
      hemolymph Na(+) and amino acids (mainly glutamine and proline) demonstrated stronger 
      osmoregulatory capacities in these salt-marsh resident spiders. To conclude, even if 
      phylogenetically close (belonging to the same, monophyletic, family), we found 
      different physiological capacities to cope with salt load among the three tested 
      spider species. Nevertheless, physiological responses to salinity were highly 
      consistent with the realized ecological niches of the spiders.

AB  - The small-bodied stereospondyl Lydekkerina huxleyi, dominated the amphibian fauna of 
      the South African Lower Triassic. Even though the anatomy of this amphibian has been 
      well described, its growth strategies and lifestyle habits have remained 
      controversial. Previous studies attributed the relative uniformity in skull sizes to 
      a predominance of subadult and adult specimens recovered in the fossil record. 
      Anatomical and taphonomic data suggested that the relatively small body-size of this 
      genus, as compared to its Permo-Triassic relatives, could be linked to a shortened, 
      rapid developmental period as an adaptation to maintain successful breeding 
      populations under harsh environmental conditions. Moreover, Lydekkerina's habitat 
      has been hypothesized to be either aquatic or mainly terrestrial. The current study, 
      utilizes bone microstructure to reassess previous hypotheses pertaining to the 
      biology and ecology of Lydekkerina. Various skeletal elements of different-sized 
      specimens are analyzed to understand its growth dynamics, intraskeletal variability, 
      and lifestyle adaptations. Bone histology revealed that our sample comprises 
      individuals at different ontogenetic stages i.e., juveniles to mature individuals. 
      Our results show that these amphibians, despite exhibiting plasticity in growth, 
      experienced an overall faster growth during early ontogeny (thereby attaining sexual 
      maturity sooner), as compared to most other temnospondyls. The microanatomy of the 
      long bones with their thick bone walls and distinctive medullary cavity suggests 
      that Lydekkerina may have been amphibious with a tendency to be more terrestrial. 
      Our study concludes that Lydekkerina employed a peculiar growth strategy and 
      lifestyle adaptations, which enabled it to endure the harsh, dry conditions of the 
      Early Triassic.

AB  - The rigid structure of the mammalian trachea is functional to maintain constant 
      patency and airflow during breathing, but no gas exchange takes place through its 
      walls. The structure of the organ in dolphins shows increased rigidity of the 
      tracheal cartilaginous rings and the presence of vascular lacunae in the submucosa. 
      However, no actual comparison was ever made between the size and capacity of the 
      vascular lacunae of the dolphin trachea and the potentially homologous structures of 
      terrestrial mammals. In the present study, the extension of the lacunae has been 
      compared between the bottlenose dolphin and the bovine, a closely related 
      terrestrial Cetartiodactyla. Our results indicate that the extension of the blood 
      spaces in the submucosa of dolphins is over 12 times larger than in the 
      corresponding structure of the bovines. Furthermore, a microscopic analysis revealed 
      the presence of valve-like structures in the walls of the cetacean lacunae. The huge 
      difference in size suggests that the lacunae are not merely a product of individual 
      physiological plasticity, but may constitute a true adaptive evolutionary character, 
      functional to life in the aquatic environment. The presence of valve-like structures 
      may be related to the regulation of blood flow, and curtail excessive compression 
      under baric stress at depth.

TI  - Estimating urban above ground biomass with multi-scale LiDAR.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s13021-018-0098-0 [doi]
LID - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urban trees have long been valued for providing ecosystem services 
      (mitigation of the "heat island" effect, suppression of air pollution, etc.); more 
      recently the potential of urban forests to store significant above ground biomass 
      (AGB) has also be recognised. However, urban areas pose particular challenges when 
      assessing AGB due to plasticity of tree form, high species diversity as well as 
      heterogeneous and complex land cover. Remote sensing, in particular light detection 
      and ranging (LiDAR), provide a unique opportunity to assess urban AGB by directly 
      measuring tree structure. In this study, terrestrial LiDAR measurements were used to 
      derive new allometry for the London Borough of Camden, that incorporates the wide 
      range of tree structures typical of an urban setting. Using a wall-to-wall airborne 
      LiDAR dataset, individual trees were then identified across the Borough with a new 
      individual tree detection (ITD) method. The new allometry was subsequently applied 
      to the identified trees, generating a Borough-wide estimate of AGB. RESULTS: Camden 
      has an estimated median AGB density of 51.6 Mg ha(-1) where maximum AGB density is 
      found in pockets of woodland; terrestrial LiDAR-derived AGB estimates suggest these 
      areas are comparable to temperate and tropical forest. Multiple linear regression of 
      terrestrial LiDAR-derived maximum height and projected crown area explained 93% of 
      variance in tree volume, highlighting the utility of these metrics to characterise 
      diverse tree structure. Locally derived allometry provided accurate estimates of 
      tree volume whereas a Borough-wide allometry tended to overestimate AGB in woodland 
      areas. The new ITD method successfully identified individual trees; however, AGB was 
      underestimated by ≤ 25% when compared to terrestrial LiDAR, owing to the inability 
      of ITD to resolve crown overlap. A Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis identified 
      assigning wood density values as the largest source of uncertainty when estimating 
      AGB. CONCLUSION: Over the coming century global populations are predicted to become 
      increasingly urbanised, leading to an unprecedented expansion of urban land cover. 
      Urban areas will become more important as carbon sinks and effective tools to assess 
      carbon densities in these areas are therefore required. Using multi-scale LiDAR 
      presents an opportunity to achieve this, providing a spatially explicit map of urban 
      forest structure and AGB.

AB  - Insect invasions, the establishment and spread of nonnative insects in new regions, 
      can have extensive economic and environmental consequences. Increased global 
      connectivity accelerates rates of introductions, while climate change may decrease 
      the barriers to invader species' spread. We follow an individual-level insect- and 
      arachnid-centered perspective to assess how the process of invasion is influenced by 
      phenotypic heterogeneity associated with dispersal and stress resistance, and their 
      coupling, across the multiple steps of the invasion process. We also provide an 
      overview and synthesis on the importance of environmental filters during the entire 
      invasion process for the facilitation or inhibition of invasive insect population 
      spread. Finally, we highlight important research gaps and the relevance and 
      applicability of ongoing natural range expansions in the context of climate change 
      to gain essential mechanistic insights into insect invasions.

TI  - Rapid cold hardening: ecological relevance, physiological mechanisms and new 
      perspectives.
LID - jeb203448 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.203448 [doi]
AB  - Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is a type of phenotypic plasticity that allows ectotherms 
      to quickly enhance cold tolerance in response to brief chilling (lasting minutes to 
      hours). In this Review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of this 
      important phenotype and provide new directions for research. As one of the fastest 
      adaptive responses to temperature known, RCH allows ectotherms to cope with sudden 
      cold snaps and to optimize their performance during diurnal cooling cycles. RCH and 
      similar phenotypes have been observed across a diversity of ectotherms, including 
      crustaceans, terrestrial arthropods, amphibians, reptiles, and fish. In addition to 
      its well-defined role in enhancing survival to extreme cold, RCH also protects 
      against nonlethal cold injury by preserving essential functions following cold 
      stress, such as locomotion, reproduction, and energy balance. The capacity for RCH 
      varies across species and across genotypes of the same species, indicating that RCH 
      can be shaped by selection and is likely favored in thermally variable environments. 
      Mechanistically, RCH is distinct from other rapid stress responses in that it 
      typically does not involve synthesis of new gene products; rather, the existing 
      cellular machinery regulates RCH through post-translational signaling mechanisms. 
      However, the protective mechanisms that enhance cold hardiness are largely unknown. 
      We provide evidence that RCH can be induced by multiple triggers in addition to low 
      temperature, and that rapidly induced tolerance and cross-tolerance to a variety of 
      environmental stressors may be a general feature of stress responses that requires 
      further investigation.

LID - 10.1086/651387 [doi]
AB  - Temperature dependence, energetics, and speed of locomotion have important 
      implications for the ecology and evolution of ants. Here, we report the results of a 
      full-factorial study investigating the responses of active metabolic rate (AMR), 
      voluntary locomotion speed, and cost of transport (COT) to three temperature 
      acclimations (7-10 d; 20 degrees, 25 degrees, and 30 degrees C) and three test 
      temperature treatments (2 h; 20 degrees, 25 degrees, and 30 degrees C) in a 
      seed-harvester ant, Messor capensis. By using a strong-inference approach, we 
      assessed these trait responses in the context of the beneficial acclimation 
      hypothesis and its alternatives. Results showed that AMR was not affected by 
      acclimation temperature, indicating limited phenotypic plasticity for this trait. By 
      contrast, voluntary running speed was consistently higher when ants were acclimated 
      at 25 degrees C, providing support for the optimal acclimation hypothesis. COT was 
      not affected by acclimation or treatment temperature. In addition, while AMR was 
      repeatable and similar across temperatures (r=0.371-0.683), the repeatabilities of 
      running speed (r=0.191-0.826) and COT (298 J kg(-1)m (-1)) were highly variable, 
      suggesting constraints on ant locomotion under certain thermal conditions. Minimum 
      COT (298 J kg(-1) m(-1)) in M. capensis was well within the range of values for 
      other terrestrial arthropods of a similar body size. This study emphasizes the need 
      to investigate a variety of performance traits rather than a single one and to 
      expand the limited body of work on plasticity of insect locomotion.

AB  - Anuran larvae exhibit high levels of phenotypic plasticity in growth and 
      developmental rates in response to variation in temperature and food availability. 
      We tested the hypothesis that alteration of developmental pathways during the 
      aquatic larval stage should affect the postmetamorphic performance of the Iberian 
      painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi). We exposed tadpoles to different temperatures 
      and food types (animal- vs. plant-based diets) to induce variation in the length of 
      the larval period and body size at metamorphosis. In this species, larval period 
      varied with temperature but was unaffected by diet composition. In contrast, size at 
      metamorphosis was shaped by the interaction between food quality and temperature; 
      tadpoles fed on an animal-based diet became bulkier metamorphs than those fed on 
      plant-based food at high (22°C) but not at low (12°C) temperature. Body condition of 
      newly metamorphosed frogs was unrelated to the temperature or food type experienced 
      during the premetamorphic stage. Frogs maintained at high temperature during the 
      larval period showed reduced jumping ability, especially when fed on the plant-based 
      diet. However, when considering size-independent jumping ability, cold-reared 
      individuals exhibited the lowest performance, and herbivores reared at 17°C the 
      highest. Cold-reared (12°C) frogs accumulated larger amounts of energy reserves than 
      individuals raised at 17°C or 22°C. This was still the case after correction for 
      differences in body mass, thus indicating some size-independent effect of 
      developmental temperature. Despite the higher lipid content of the carnivorous diet, 
      the differences in energy reserves between herbivores and carnivores were relatively 
      weak and associated with differences in body size. These results suggest that the 
      consequences of environmental variation in the larval habitat can extend to the 
      terrestrial phase and influence juvenile growth and survival.

AB  - Correlated electrophysiological and behavioral experiments in the snail Helix 
      lucorum were conducted to investigate the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to 
      synaptic plasticity during withdrawal reflex and aversive context memory 
      development. Time, stimulation frequency and number of tetani/electrical shocks were 
      determined in vitro and in vivo. In isolated brain preparations, nerve tetanization 
      accompanied by bath application of serotonin induced long-term facilitation (LTF) of 
      the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in withdrawal interneurons. Bathing 
      with either the NO-synthase inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginin (L-NNA) or the 
      NO-scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) before 
      the tetanization prevented tetanus-induced long-term increase of EPSP. Withdrawal 
      interneurons are key elements in the network underlying aversive behavior, with LTF 
      considered the basis for aversive learning. We hypothesized that L-NNA injections in 
      free-behaving snails could influence aversive learning. Snails were trained for 1 or 
      5days to remember the context in which they were shocked. In one-day training 
      experiments, the snails received 5 electrical shocks in one context. Different 
      groups of snails were sham-injected or L-NNA-injected before or after training. 
      After training, the sham-injected groups demonstrated a significant increase in 
      behavioral responses compared to the L-NNA-injected groups. On the following day, 
      only sham-injected snails demonstrated altered behavioral responses, but no 
      associative context differences were observed. These results correlated with the 
      electrophysiological results. In another series of experiments, the snails received 
      electrical shocks for 5days. Testing on the second day after training demonstrated 
      that the sham-injected group maintained selective aversive context memory, whereas 
      the L-NNA-injected snails were not different between the two contexts. Together 
      these results demonstrated that inhibition of NO synthesis prevents memory formation 
      and influences synaptic plasticity in the withdrawal interneurons that underlie the 
      behavioral changes. This suggests that NO influences the behavior via regulation of 
      synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Means and variances of the environmental thermal regime play an important role in 
      determining the fitness of terrestrial ectotherms. Adaptive phenotypic responses 
      induced by heterogeneous temperatures have been shown to be mediated by molecular 
      pathways independent of the classic heat shock responses; however, an in-depth 
      understanding of plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We 
      investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal 
      regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of 
      fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages of Drosophila 
      melanogaster For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of 
      high-amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal 
      maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult 
      acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold 
      tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions 
      irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily 
      lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant 
      regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that the effect of fluctuations at 
      any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a 
      more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with adult 
      acclimation in D.melanogaster.

AB  - KEY POINTS: The degree to which developmental programmes or environmental signals 
      determine physiological phenotypes remains a major question in physiology. 
      Vertebrates change environments during development, confounding interpretation of 
      the degree to which development (i.e. permanent processes) or phenotypic plasticity 
      (i.e. reversible processes) produces phenotypes. Tadpoles mainly breathe water for 
      gas exchange and frogs may breathe water or air depending on their environment and 
      are, therefore, exemplary models to differentiate the degree to which life-stage vs. 
      environmental context drives developmental phenotypes associated with neural control 
      of lung breathing. Using isolated brainstem preparations and patch clamp 
      electrophysiology, we demonstrate that adult bullfrogs acclimatized to 
      water-breathing conditions do not exhibit CO(2) and O(2) chemosensitivity of lung 
      breathing, similar to water-breathing tadpoles. Our results establish that 
      phenotypes associated with developmental stage may arise from plasticity per se and 
      suggest that a developmental trajectory coinciding with environmental change 
      obscures origins of stage-dependent physiological phenotypes by masking plasticity. 
      ABSTRACT: An unanswered question in developmental physiology is to what extent does 
      the environment vs. a genetic programme produce phenotypes? Developing animals 
      inhabit different environments and switch from one to another. Thus a developmental 
      time course overlapping with environmental change confounds interpretations as to 
      whether development (i.e. permanent processes) or phenotypic plasticity (i.e. 
      reversible processes) generates phenotypes. Tadpoles of the American bullfrog, 
      Lithobates catesbeianus, breathe water at early life-stages and minimally use lungs 
      for gas exchange. As adults, bullfrogs rely on lungs for gas exchange, but spend 
      months per year in ice-covered ponds without lung breathing. Aquatic submergence, 
      therefore, removes environmental pressures requiring lung breathing and enables 
      separation of adulthood from environmental factors associated with adulthood that 
      necessitate control of lung ventilation. To test the hypothesis that postmetamorphic 
      respiratory control phenotypes arise through permanent developmental changes vs. 
      reversible environmental signals, we measured respiratory-related nerve discharge in 
      isolated brainstem preparations and action potential firing from CO(2) -sensitive 
      neurons in bullfrogs acclimatized to semi-terrestrial (air-breathing) and 
      aquatic-overwintering (no air-breathing) habitats. We found that aquatic 
      overwintering significantly reduced neuroventilatory responses to CO(2) and O(2) 
      involved in lung breathing. Strikingly, this gas sensitivity profile reflects that 
      of water-breathing tadpoles. We further demonstrated that aquatic overwintering 
      reduced CO(2) -induced firing responses of chemosensitive neurons. In contrast, 
      respiratory rhythm generating processes remained adult-like after submergence. Our 
      results establish that phenotypes associated with life-stage can arise from 
      phenotypic plasticity per se. This provides evidence that developmental time courses 
      coinciding with environmental changes obscure interpretations regarding origins of 
      stage-dependent physiological phenotypes by masking plasticity.

AB  - Terrestrial isopods have evolved pleopodal lungs that provide access to the rich 
      aerial supply of oxygen. However, isopods occupy conditions with wide and 
      unpredictable thermal and oxygen gradients, suggesting that they might have evolved 
      adaptive developmental plasticity in their respiratory organs to help meet metabolic 
      demand over a wide range of oxygen conditions. To explore this plasticity, we 
      conducted an experiment in which we reared common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) 
      from eggs to maturation at different temperatures (15 and 22 °C) combined with 
      different oxygen levels (10% and 22% O(2)). We sampled animals during development 
      (only females) and then examined mature adults (both sexes). We compared woodlice 
      between treatments with respect to the area of their pleopod exopodites (our proxy 
      of lung size) and the shape of Bertalanffy's equations (our proxy of individual 
      growth curves). Generally, males exhibited larger lungs than females relative to 
      body size. Woodlice also grew relatively fast but achieved a decreased asymptotic 
      body mass in response to warm conditions; the oxygen did not affect growth. Under 
      hypoxia, growing females developed larger lungs compared to under normoxia, but only 
      in the late stage of development. Among mature animals, this effect was present only 
      in males. Woodlice reared under warm conditions had relatively small lungs, in both 
      developing females (the effect was increased in relatively large females) and among 
      mature males and females. Our results demonstrated that woodlice exhibit phenotypic 
      plasticity in their lung size. We suggest that this plasticity helps woodlice 
      equilibrate their gas exchange capacity to differences in the oxygen supply and 
      metabolic demand along environmental temperature and oxygen gradients. The complex 
      pattern of plasticity might indicate the effects of a balance between water 
      conservation and oxygen uptake, which would be especially pronounced in mature 
      females that need to generate an aqueous environment inside their brood pouch.

TI  - The complex drivers of thermal acclimation and breadth in ectotherms.
PG  - 1425-1439

AB  - Thermal acclimation capacity, the degree to which organisms can alter their optimal 
      performance temperature and critical thermal limits with changing temperatures, 
      reflects their ability to respond to temperature variability and thus might be 
      important for coping with global climate change. Here, we combine simulation 
      modelling with analysis of published data on thermal acclimation and breadth (range 
      of temperatures over which organisms perform well) to develop a framework for 
      predicting thermal plasticity across taxa, latitudes, body sizes, traits, habitats 
      and methodological factors. Our synthesis includes > 2000 measures of acclimation 
      capacities from > 500 species of ectotherms spanning fungi, invertebrates, and 
      vertebrates from freshwater, marine and terrestrial habitats. We find that body 
      size, latitude, and methodological factors often interact to shape acclimation 
      responses and that acclimation rate scales negatively with body size, contributing 
      to a general negative association between body size and thermal breadth across 
      species. Additionally, we reveal that acclimation capacity increases with body size, 
      increases with latitude (to mid-latitudinal zones) and seasonality for smaller but 
      not larger organisms, decreases with thermal safety margin (upper lethal temperature 
      minus maximum environmental temperatures), and is regularly underestimated because 
      of experimental artefacts. We then demonstrate that our framework can predict the 
      contribution of acclimation plasticity to the IUCN threat status of amphibians 
      globally, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity is already buffering some species 
      from climate change.

AB  - Terrestrial higher plants are composed of roots and shoots, distinct organs that 
      conduct complementary functions in dissimilar environments. For example, roots are 
      responsible for acquiring water and nutrients such as inorganic nitrogen from the 
      soil, yet shoots consume the majority of these resources. The success of such a 
      relationship depends on excellent root-shoot communications. Increased net 
      photosynthesis and decreased shoot nitrogen and water use at elevated CO2 
      fundamentally alter these source-sink relations. Lower than predicted productivity 
      gains at elevated CO2 under nitrogen or water stress may indicate shoot-root 
      signaling lacks plasticity to respond to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The 
      following presents recent research results on shoot-root nitrogen and water 
      signaling, emphasizing the influence that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels 
      are having on these source-sink interactions.

AB  - Adaptive changes in locomotory control and perception occur in environments where 
      the normal relationship between effort and body displacement is altered (1,2). We 
      have further investigated this plastic relationship by altering visual feedback 
      during voluntary walking in place on a rotary treadmill. When the velocity of 
      optical flow was increased or reversed relative to normal for the steps being made, 
      subjects reported changes in perceived self-motion, the size, rate, and/or direction 
      of their voluntary steps, the extent of voluntary effort required, and the apparent 
      stability of a hand-held support bar. The floor and the visual environment were 
      perceived as stable. We will show that these perceptual remappings obey "terrestrial 
      constraints."

TI  - Global inventory of atmospheric fibrous microplastics input into the ocean: An

AB  - Atmospheric transport could be a significant pathway for inland microplastics (MPs, 
      with size＜5 mm) to the ocean in addition to catchment runoff and coastal discharge. 
      However, atmospheric input of MPs to the ocean is rarely quantified. To address this 
      issue, transport of atmospheric MPs from source to sink was studied in the 
      Asia-Pacific region during nine cruises from October 2018 to September 2019. Both 
      deposited atmospheric MPs (DAMPs) and suspended atmospheric MPs (SAMPs) were 
      collected, ranging from 23.04 n/(m(2)·d) to 67.54 n/(m(2)·d), and 0 to 1.37 n/m(3), 
      respectively. Size composition revealed that atmospheric deposition of MPs 
      originating in terrestrial regions seems inadequate and insufficient to quantify the 
      atmospheric input to the ocean. In addition, combined with aerodynamic modelling, 
      for the first time, we estimated that 7.64-33.76 t of fibrous atmospheric MPs was 
      globally generated in 2018, which is 3 % and 31 % of riverine input MPs of The 
      Yangtze River and The Pearl River in terms of mid-point mass, respectively. The 
      increasing load of ingestible plastics from sea air could have a far-reaching impact 
      on marine ecosystem.

PG  - 12550

LID - 12550
AB  - Earth is the only terrestrial planet in our solar system where an oceanic plate 
      subducts beneath an overriding plate. Although the initiation of plate subduction 
      requires extremely weak boundaries between strong plates, the way in which oceanic 
      mantle rheologically weakens remains unknown. Here we show that shear-enhanced 
      hydration reactions contribute to the generation and maintenance of weak mantle 
      shear zones at mid-lithospheric depths. High-pressure friction experiments on 
      peridotite gouge reveal that in the presence of hydrothermal water, increasing 
      strain and reactions lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction in strength. The rate 
      of deformation is controlled by pressure-solution-accommodated frictional sliding on 
      weak hydrous phyllosilicate (talc), providing a mechanism for the 'cutoff' of the 
      high peak strength at the brittle-plastic transition. Our findings suggest that 
      infiltration of seawater into transform faults with long lengths and low slip rates 
      is an important controlling factor on the initiation of plate tectonics on 
      terrestrial planets.

AB  - Microorganisms use transmembrane sensory receptors to perceive a wide range of 
      environmental factors. It is unclear how rapidly the sensory properties of these 
      receptors can be modified when microorganisms adapt to novel environments. Here, we 
      demonstrate experimentally that the response of an Escherichia coli chemotaxis 
      receptor to its chemical ligands can be easily inverted by mutations at several 
      sites along receptor sequence. We also perform molecular dynamics simulations to 
      shed light on the mechanism of the transmembrane signaling by E. coli 
      chemoreceptors. Finally, we use receptors with inverted signaling to map 
      determinants that enable the same receptor to sense multiple environmental factors, 
      including metal ions, aromatic compounds, osmotic pressure, and salt ions. Our 
      findings demonstrate high plasticity of signaling and provide further insights into 
      the mechanisms of stimulus sensing and processing by bacterial chemoreceptors.

TI  - Is hemiepiphytism an adaptation to high irradiance? Testing seedling responses to 
      light levels and drought in hemiepiphytic and non-hemiepiphytic Ficus.
PG  - 74-86
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-3054.2012.01694.x [doi]
AB  - The epiphytic growth habit in many Ficus species during their juvenile stages has 
      commonly been hypothesized to be an adaptation for avoiding deep shade in the forest 
      understory, but this has never been tested experimentally. We examined growth and 
      ecophysiology in seedlings of three hemiepiphytic (Hs) and three non-hemiepiphytic 
      (NHs) Ficus species grown under different irradiance levels. Both Hs and NHs 
      exhibited characteristics of high light requiring species, such as high plasticity 
      to growth irradiance and relatively high maximum photosynthetic assimilation rates. 
      Diurnal measurements of leaf gas exchange showed that Hs have much shorter active 
      photosynthetic periods than NHs; moreover, leaves of Hs have lower xylem hydraulic 
      conductivity but stronger drought tolerance as indicated by much lower rates of leaf 
      diebacks during the drought treatment. Seedlings of NHs had 3.3- and 13.3-fold 
      greater height and biomass than those of Hs species after growing in the nursery for 
      5 months, indicating a trade-off between growth and drought tolerance due to the 
      conflicting requirements for xylem conductivity and cavitation resistance. This 
      study does not support the shade-avoidance hypothesis; rather, it suggests that the 
      canopy regeneration in Hs is an adaptation to avoid alternative terrestrial 
      growth-related risks imposed to tiny Ficus seedlings. The NHs with terrestrial 
      regeneration reduce these risks by having an initial burst of growth to rapidly gain 
      relatively large seedling sizes, while in Hs seedlings more conservative water use 
      and greater drought tolerance for surviving the canopy environment are intrinsically 
      associated with slow growth.

TI  - Are the Antarctic dipteran, Eretmoptera murphyi, and Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura 
      arctica, vulnerable to rising temperatures?
PG  - 494-503
LID - 10.1017/S0007485314000261 [doi]
AB  - Polar terrestrial invertebrates are suggested as being vulnerable to temperature 
      change relative to lower latitude species, and hence possibly also to climate 
      warming. Previous studies have shown Antarctic and Arctic Collembola and Acari to 
      possess good heat tolerance and survive temperature exposures above 30 °C. To test 
      this feature further, the heat tolerance and physiological plasticity of heat stress 
      were explored in the Arctic collembolan, Megaphorura arctica, from Svalbard and the 
      Antarctic midge, Eretmoptera murphyi, from Signy Island. The data obtained 
      demonstrate considerable heat tolerance in both species, with upper lethal 
      temperatures ≥35 °C (1 h exposures), and tolerance of exposure to 10 and 15 °C 
      exceeding 56 days. This tolerance is far beyond that required in their current 
      environment. Average microhabitat temperatures in August 2011 ranged between 5.1 and 
      8.1 °C, and rarely rose above 10 °C, in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard. Summer soil 
      microhabitat temperatures on Signy Island have previously been shown to range 
      between 0 and 10 °C. There was also evidence to suggest that E. murphyi can recover 
      from high-temperature exposure and that M. arctica is capable of rapid heat 
      hardening. M. arctica and E. murphyi therefore have the physiological capacity to 
      tolerate current environmental conditions, as well as future warming. If the 
      features they express are characteristically more general, such polar terrestrial 
      invertebrates will likely fare well under climate warming scenarios.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are widely contaminated by microplastics due to extensive 
      usage and poor handling of plastic materials, but the subsequent fate and remediate 
      strategy of these pollutants are far from fully understood. In soil environments, 
      microplastics pose a potential threat to the survival, growth, and reproduction of 
      soil microbiota that in turn threaten the biodiversity, function, and services of 
      terrestrial ecosystems. Meanwhile, microorganisms are sensitive to microplastics due 
      to the adaptability to changes in substrates and soil properties. Through the 
      metabolic and mineralization processes, microorganisms are also crucial participator 
      to the plastic biodegradation. In this review, we present current knowledges and 
      research results of interactions between microplastics and microorganisms (both 
      fungi and bacteria) in soil environments and mainly discuss the following: (1) 
      effects of microplastics on microbial habitats via changes in soil physical, 
      chemical, and biological properties; (2) effects of microplastics on soil microbial 
      communities and functions; and (3) soil microbial-mediated plastic degradation with 
      the likely mechanisms and potential remediation strategies. We aim to analyze the 
      mechanisms driving these interactions and subsequent ecological effects, propose 
      future directives for the study of microplastic in soils, and provide valuable 
      information on the plastic bioremediation in contaminated soils.

AB  - The Lower Columbia River in Oregon and Washington, USA, is an important resource for 
      aquatic and terrestrial organisms, agriculture, and commerce. An 86-mile stretch of 
      the river was sampled over a 3year period in order to determine the spatial and 
      temporal trends in the occurrence and concentration of water-borne organic 
      contaminants. Sampling occurred at 10 sites along this stretch and at 1 site on the 
      Willamette River using the semipermeable membrane device (SPMD) and the polar 
      organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) passive samplers. Contaminant profiles 
      followed the predicted trends of lower numbers of detections and associated 
      concentrations in the rural areas to higher numbers and concentrations at the more 
      urbanized sites. Industrial chemicals, plasticizers, and PAHs were present at the 
      highest concentrations. Differences in concentrations between sampling periods were 
      related to the amount of rainfall during the sampling period. In general, water 
      concentrations of wastewater-related contaminants decreased and concentrations of 
      legacy contaminants slightly increased with increasing rainfall amounts.

AB  - Organisms rely upon external cues to avoid detrimental conditions during 
      environmental change. Rapid water loss, or desiccation, is a universal threat for 
      terrestrial plants and animals, especially under climate change, but the cues that 
      facilitate plastic responses to avoid desiccation are unclear. We integrate 
      acclimation experiments with gene expression analyses to identify the cues that 
      regulate resistance to water loss at the physiological and regulatory level in a 
      montane salamander (Plethodon metcalfi). Here we show that temperature is an 
      important cue for developing a desiccation-resistant phenotype and might act as a 
      reliable cue for organisms across the globe. Gene expression analyses consistently 
      identify regulation of stem cell differentiation and embryonic development of 
      vasculature. The temperature-sensitive blood vessel development suggests that 
      salamanders regulate water loss through the regression and regeneration of capillary 
      beds in the skin, indicating that tissue regeneration may be used for physiological 
      purposes beyond replacing lost limbs.

AB  - Heterotrophic microorganisms are commonly thought to be stoichiometrically 
      homeostatic but their stoichiometric plasticity has rarely been examined, 
      particularly in terrestrial ecosystems. Using a fertilization experiment in a 
      tropical rainforest, we evaluated how variable substrate stoichiometry may influence 
      the stoichiometry of microbial communities in the leaf litter layer and in the 
      underlying soil. C:N:P ratios of the microbial biomass were higher in the organic 
      litter layer than in the underlying mineral soil. Regardless of higher ratios for 
      litter microbial communities, C, N, and P fertilization effects on microbial 
      stoichiometry were strong in both litter and soil, without any fundamental 
      difference in plasticity between these two communities. Overall, N:P ratios were 
      more constrained than C:nutrient ratios for both litter and soil microbial 
      communities, suggesting that stoichiometric plasticity arises because of a 
      decoupling between C and nutrients. Contrary to the simplifying premise of strict 
      homeostasis in microbial decomposers, we conclude that both litter and soil 
      communities can adapt their C:N:P stoichiometry in response to the stoichiometric 
      imbalance of available resources.

AB  - The role of DNA methylation and its interaction with gene expression and 
      transcriptome plasticity is poorly understood, and current insight comes mainly from 
      studies in very few model plant species. Here, we study gene body DNA methylation 
      (gbM) and gene expression patterns in ecotypes from contrasting thermal environments 
      of two marine plants with contrasting life history strategies in order to explore 
      the potential role epigenetic mechanisms could play in gene plasticity and 
      responsiveness to heat stress. In silico transcriptome analysis of CpG(O/E) ratios 
      suggested that the bulk of Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa genes possess 
      high levels of intragenic methylation. We also observed a correlation between gbM 
      and gene expression flexibility: genes with low DNA methylation tend to show 
      flexible gene expression and plasticity under changing conditions. Furthermore, the 
      empirical determination of global DNA methylation (5-mC) showed patterns of intra 
      and inter-specific divergence that suggests a link between methylation level and the 
      plants' latitude of origin and life history. Although we cannot discern whether gbM 
      regulates gene expression or vice versa, or if other molecular mechanisms play a 
      role in facilitating transcriptome responsiveness, our findings point to the 
      existence of a relationship between gene responsiveness and gbM patterns in marine 
      plants.

TI  - Physiological ecology meets climate change.
PG  - 1025-30

AB  - In this article, we pointed out that understanding the physiology of differential 
      climate change effects on organisms is one of the many urgent challenges faced in 
      ecology and evolutionary biology. We explore how physiological ecology can 
      contribute to a holistic view of climate change impacts on organisms and ecosystems 
      and their evolutionary responses. We suggest that theoretical and experimental 
      efforts not only need to improve our understanding of thermal limits to organisms, 
      but also to consider multiple stressors both on land and in the oceans. As an 
      example, we discuss recent efforts to understand the effects of various global 
      change drivers on aquatic ectotherms in the field that led to the development of the 
      concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) as a framework 
      integrating various drivers and linking organisational levels from ecosystem to 
      organism, tissue, cell, and molecules. We suggest seven core objectives of a 
      comprehensive research program comprising the interplay among physiological, 
      ecological, and evolutionary approaches for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. 
      While studies of individual aspects are already underway in many laboratories 
      worldwide, integration of these findings into conceptual frameworks is needed not 
      only within one organism group such as animals but also across organism domains such 
      as Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Indeed, development of unifying concepts is 
      relevant for interpreting existing and future findings in a coherent way and for 
      projecting the future ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change on 
      functional biodiversity. We also suggest that OCLTT may in the end and from an 
      evolutionary point of view, be able to explain the limited thermal tolerance of 
      metazoans when compared to other organisms.

AB  - In modern life petroleum-based plastic has become indispensable due to its frequent 
      use as an easily available and a low cost packaging and moulding material. However, 
      its rapidly growing use is causing aquatic and terrestrial pollution. Under these 
      circumstances, research and development for biodegradable plastic (bioplastics) is 
      inevitable. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a type of microbial polyester that 
      accumulates as a carbon/energy storage material in various microorganisms can be a 
      good alternative. In this study, 23 cyanobacterial strains (15 heterocystous and 8 
      non-heterocystous) were screened for PHB production. The highest PHB (6.44% w/w of 
      dry cells) was detected in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 and the lowest in Spirulina 
      platensis NCCU-S5 (0.51% w/w of dry cells), whereas no PHB was found in 
      Cylindrospermum sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Plectonema sp. Presence of PHB granules in 
      Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 was confirmed microscopically with Sudan black B and Nile 
      red A staining. Pretreatment of biomass with methanol: acetone: water: 
      dimethylformamide [40: 40: 18: 2 (MAD-I)] with 2 h magnetic bar stirring followed by 
      30 h continuous chloroform soxhlet extraction acted as optimal extraction 
      conditions. Optimized physicochemical conditions viz. 7.5 pH, 30°C temperature, 
      10:14 h light:dark periods with 0.4% glucose (as additional carbon source), 1.0 gl-1 
      sodium chloride and phosphorus deficiency yielded 26.37% PHB on 7th day instead of 
      21st day. Using FTIR, 1H NMR and GC-MS, extracted polymer was identified as PHB. 
      Thermal properties (melting temperature, decomposition temperatures etc.) of the 
      extracted polymer were determined by TGA and DSC. Further, the polymer showed good 
      tensile strength and young's modulus with a low extension to break ratio comparable 
      to petrochemical plastic. Biodegradability potential tested as weight loss 
      percentage showed efficient degradation (24.58%) of PHB within 60 days by mixed 
      microbial culture in comparison to petrochemical plastic.

      Curve Evolution in a Clade with Diverse Habitat Affinities.
PG  - 530-544
LID - 10.1086/701827 [doi]
AB  - Performance curves are valuable tools for quantifying the fundamental niches of 
      organisms and testing hypotheses about evolution, life-history trade-offs, and the 
      drivers of variation in species' distribution patterns. Here, we present a novel 
      Bayesian method for characterizing performance curves that facilitates comparisons 
      among species. We then use this model to quantify and compare the hydrological 
      performance curves of 14 different taxa in the genus Lasthenia, an ecologically 
      diverse clade of plants that collectively occupy a variety of habitats with unique 
      hydrological features, including seasonally flooded wetlands called vernal pools. We 
      conducted a growth chamber experiment to measure each taxon's fitness across five 
      hydrological treatments that ranged from severe drought to extended flooding, and we 
      identified differences in hydrological performance curves that explain their 
      associations with vernal pool and terrestrial habitats. Our analysis revealed that 
      the distribution of vernal pool taxa in the field does not reflect their optimal 
      hydrological environments: all taxa, regardless of habitat affinity, have highest 
      fitness under similar hydrological conditions of saturated soil without submergence. 
      We also found that a taxon's relative position across flood gradients within vernal 
      pools is best predicted by the height of its performance curve. These results 
      demonstrate the utility of our approach for generating insights into when and how 
      performance curves evolve among taxa as they diversify into distinct environments. 
      To facilitate its use, the modeling framework has been developed into an R package.

PG  - e58323

LID - e58323
AB  - Environmental factors can lead individuals down different developmental pathways 
      giving rise to distinct phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity). The production of winged 
      or unwinged morphs in aphids is an example of two alternative developmental 
      pathways. Dispersal is paramount in aphids that often have a metapopulation 
      structure, where local subpopulations frequently go extinct, such as the specialized 
      aphids on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare). We conducted various experiments to further 
      understand the cues involved in the production of winged dispersal morphs by the two 
      dominant species of the tansy aphid metacommunity, Metopeurum fuscoviride and 
      Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria. We found that the ant-tended M. fuscoviride produced 
      winged individuals predominantly at the beginning of the season while the untended 
      M. tanacetaria produced winged individuals throughout the season. Winged mothers of 
      both species produced winged offspring, although in both species winged offspring 
      were mainly produced by unwinged females. Crowding and the presence of predators, 
      effects already known to influence wing production in other aphid species, increased 
      the percentage of winged offspring in M. tanacetaria, but not in M. fuscoviride. We 
      find there are also other factors (i.e. temporal effects) inducing the production of 
      winged offspring for natural aphid populations. Our results show that the responses 
      of each aphid species are due to multiple wing induction cues.

LID - 10.1242/jeb.020958 [doi]
AB  - Plasticity in hatching timing allows embryos to balance egg- and larval-stage risks, 
      and depends on the ability of hatching-competent embryos to continue developing in 
      the egg. Hypoxia can slow development, kill embryos and induce premature hatching. 
      For terrestrial eggs of red-eyed treefrogs, the embryonic period can extend 
      approximately 50% longer than development to hatching competence, and development is 
      synchronous across perivitelline oxygen levels (PO2) ranging from 0.5-16.5 kPa. 
      Embryos maintain large external gills until hatching, then gills regress rapidly. We 
      assessed the respiratory value of external gills using gill manipulations and 
      closed-system respirometry. Embryos without external gills were oxygen limited in 
      air and hatched at an external PO2 of 17 kPa, whereas embryos with gills regulated 
      their metabolism and remained in the egg at substantially lower PO2. By contrast, 
      tadpoles gained no respiratory benefit from external gills. We videotaped behavior 
      and manipulated embryos to test if they position gills near the air-exposed portion 
      of the egg surface, where PO2 is highest. Active embryos remained stationary for 
      minutes in gills-at-surface positions. After manipulations and spontaneous movements 
      that positioned gills in the O2-poor region of the egg, however, they returned their 
      gills to the air-exposed surface within seconds. Even neural tube stage embryos, 
      capable only of ciliary rotation, positioned their developing head in the region of 
      highest PO2. Such behavior may be critical both to delay hatching after hatching 
      competence and to obtain sufficient oxygen for normal, synchronous development at 
      earlier stages.

TI  - Four hundred million years of silica biomineralization in land plants.
PG  - 5449-54
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1500289112 [doi]
AB  - Biomineralization plays a fundamental role in the global silicon cycle. Grasses are 
      known to mobilize significant quantities of Si in the form of silica biominerals and 
      dominate the terrestrial realm today, but they have relatively recent origins and 
      only rose to taxonomic and ecological prominence within the Cenozoic Era. This 
      raises questions regarding when and how the biological silica cycle evolved. To 
      address these questions, we examined silica abundances of extant members of 
      early-diverging land plant clades, which show that silica biomineralization is 
      widespread across terrestrial plant linages. Particularly high silica abundances are 
      observed in lycophytes and early-diverging ferns. However, silica biomineralization 
      is rare within later-evolving gymnosperms, implying a complex evolutionary history 
      within the seed plants. Electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy show that the 
      most common silica-mineralized tissues include the vascular system, epidermal cells, 
      and stomata, which is consistent with the hypothesis that biomineralization in 
      plants is frequently coupled to transpiration. Furthermore, sequence, phylogenetic, 
      and structural analysis of nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins from diverse plant 
      genomes points to a plastic and ancient capacity for silica accumulation within 
      terrestrial plants. The integration of these two comparative biology approaches 
      demonstrates that silica biomineralization has been an important process for land 
      plants over the course of their >400 My evolutionary history.

TI  - Mycorrhizal fungi isolated from native terrestrial orchids of pristine regions in 
      Cordoba (Argentina).
PG  - 275-83
AB  - Orchidaceae is a highly dependent group on the Rhizoctonia complex that includes 
      Ceratorhiza, Moniliopsis, Epulorhiza and Rhizoctonia, for seed germination and the 
      development of new orchid plants. Thus, the isolation and identification of orchid 
      mycorrhizal fungi are important to understand the orchid-fungus relationship, which 
      can lead to the development of efficient conservation strategies by in vivo 
      germination of seeds from endangered orchid plants. The aim of our work was to 
      isolate and characterize the different mycorrhizal fungi found in roots of 
      terrestrial orchids from Cordoba (Argentina), and, to learn about the natural habit 
      and fungal associations in the Chaco Serrano woodland pristine region. In this 
      study, bloomed orchid root and rhizosphere soil samples were obtained in two times 
      from Valle de Punilla during spring of 2007; samples were kept in plastic bags until 
      processed within 48 hours, and mycorrhizal condition confirmed assessing peloton 
      presence. A total of 23 isolates of the orchideous mycorrhizal Rhizoctonia complex 
      were obtained. The isolates were studied based on morphological characters and 
      ITS-rDNA sequences. Morphological characteristics as color of colonies, texture, 
      growth rate, hyphal diameter and length and presence of sclerotia were observed on 
      culture media. To define the number of nuclei per cell, the isolates were grown in 
      Petri dishes containing water-agar (WA) for three days at 25 degrees C and stained 
      with Safranine-O solution. The mycorrhizal fungi were grouped into binucleate 
      (MSGib, 10 isolates) and multinucleate (MSGim, 13 isolates) based on morphological 
      characteristics of the colonies. We obtained the ITS1-5.8s-ITS4 region that was 
      amplified using primers ITSI and ITS4. Based on DNA sequencing, isolates Q23 and Q29 
      were found to be related to species of Ceratobasidium. Isolates Q24 and Q4 were 
      related to the binucleated anastomosis group AG-C of Rhizoctonia sp. The rest of the 
      isolates grouped in the Ceratobasidium clade without grouping. From our knowledge 
      this is the first report of the asso- ciation of the AG-C testers with terrestrial 
      orchids. A high specificity was observed in the symbiotic relationship. As the 
      mycorrhizal fungal isolates were obtained from native orchids, they could be 
      incorporated in conservation programes of endangered orchids in Argentina.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are emerging as a severe threat in our environment. Their 
      diverse existence in marine environments is being researched globally and thus a 
      widely known fact; however, their presence in the freshwater counterpart has gained 
      attention lately only. Riverine systems, the most critical freshwater resources 
      serve as an essential link between terrestrial and marine environments and their 
      contamination with MPs is going to create severe environmental issues. Because of 
      their small size and unique morphology, these polymers can exhibit variable toxicity 
      to the interacting biota and alter their habitat properties; thus, causing serious 
      impacts on the environment and health of living beings, including humans. These 
      microplastics can also interact with pollutants like heavy metals and organic 
      pollutants, which further augment their harming potential. Inefficient and poor 
      plastic waste disposal practices play an important role in the generation of 
      microplastic pollutants. In the present COVID 19 pandemics, the excessive use of 
      plastic to contain the spread of infection has further added the plastic load in the 
      environment which will eventually lead to the generation of microplastic particles. 
      Also, a significant amount of microplastic pollutants in riverine systems are 
      delivered through wastewater treatment plant effluents. These trade-offs create a 
      distress situation in the environment. The present study connects these key issues 
      for a better understanding of the diverse existence of microplastic pollutants, 
      their sources, and fate, with a special emphasis on riverine systems. A critical 
      appraisal of the knowledge gaps and proposal of suitable solutions through this 
      review might open up avenues for further research and effective management of the 
      microplastics in aquatic environments.

LID - 181211
AB  - BACKGROUND: Five hundred milliliter bags of water, referred to as 'sachet water,' 
      are widely used in Liberia, as they are low cost, safe sources of clean drinking 
      water for the population. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine sources of 
      drinking water in the study area, the rate of sachet water use, empty sachet water 
      disposal methods and environmental problems associated with sachet water waste 
      disposal. METHODS: Using a simple random sampling technique, 257 respondents were 
      interviewed between April and June 2018 using structured questionnaires. On a 
      five-point Likert scale with a mean score of 3 as the cutoff point, data were 
      analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The paper found that sachet water 
      (mean (M)=4.37) is an essential source of drinking water in Liberia with a daily 
      consumption rate of at least 6 bags of sachet water per individual. Affordability, 
      availability, and safety were named by respondents as reasons for their consumption 
      of sachet water. Improper disposal methods practiced by the residents of Liberia 
      included ground littering (M=3.42) and burning (M=3.03). CONCLUSIONS: Sachet water 
      consumption has contributed to environmental issues such as drainage system clogs, 
      littering of the environment, the death of terrestrial and aquatic animals due to 
      plastic waste consumption, reduction of oxygen for aquatic life and soil 
      infertility. We recommend the creation of policies and enforcement of sachet water 
      production to include reuse and recycling of sachet water by-products as a 
      requirement for licensing of producers, provision of adequate waste bins and the use 
      of public education campaigns to educate residents on environmental best practices. 
      ETHICS APPROVAL: This study was approved by the Institute for Population Studies, 
      University of Liberia, Monrovia, Liberia. INFORMED CONSENT: Obtained. COMPETING 
      INTERESTS: The authors declare no competing financial interests.

TI  - Estimating potential risks to terrestrial invertebrates and plants exposed to 
      bisphenol A in soil amended with activated sludge biosolids.
PG  - 467-75
LID - 10.1002/etc.49 [doi]
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume substance primarily used to produce 
      polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins. During manufacture and use, BPA may enter 
      wastewater treatment plants. During treatment, BPA may become adsorbed to activated 
      sludge biosolids, which may expose soil organisms to BPA if added to soil as an 
      amendment. To evaluate potential risks to organisms that make up the base of the 
      terrestrial food web (i.e., invertebrates and plants) in accordance with 
      international regulatory practice, toxicity tests were conducted with potworms 
      (Enchytraeids) and springtails (Collembolans) in artificial soil, and six plant 
      types using natural soil. No-observed-effect concentrations (NOEC) for potworms and 
      springtails were equal to or greater than 100 and equal to or greater than 500 mg/kg 
      (dry wt), respectively. The lowest organic matter-normalized NOEC among all tests 
      (dry shoot weight of tomatoes) was 37 mg/kg-dry weight. Dividing by an assessment 
      factor of 10, a predicted-no-effect concentration in soil (PNEC(soil)) of 3.7 
      mg/kg-dry weight was calculated. Following international regulatory guidance, BPA 
      concentrations in soil hypothetically amended with biosolids were calculated using 
      published BPA concentrations in biosolids. The upper 95th percentile BPA biosolids 
      concentration in North America is 14.2 mg/kg-dry weight, and in Europe is 95 
      mg/kg-dry weight. Based on recommended biosolids application rates, predicted BPA 
      concentrations in soil (PEC(soil)) would be 0.021 mg/kg-dry weight for North America 
      and 0.14 mg/kg-dry weight for Europe. Hazard quotients (ratio of PEC(soil) and 
      PNEC(soil)) for BPA were all equal to or less than 0.04. This indicates that risks 
      to representative invertebrates and plants at the base of the terrestrial food web 
      are low if exposed to BPA in soil amended with activated sludge biosolids.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity of gas exchange pattern and water loss in Scarabaeus spretus 
      (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae): deconstructing the basis for metabolic rate variation.
PG  - 2940-9
LID - 10.1242/jeb.041889 [doi]
AB  - Investigation of gas exchange patterns and modulation of metabolism provide insight 
      into metabolic control systems and evolution in diverse terrestrial environments. 
      Variation in metabolic rate in response to environmental conditions has been 
      explained largely in the context of two contrasting hypotheses, namely metabolic 
      depression in response to stressful or resource-(e.g. water) limited conditions, or 
      elevation of metabolism at low temperatures to sustain life in extreme conditions. 
      To deconstruct the basis for metabolic rate changes in response to temperature 
      variation, here we undertake a full factorial study investigating the longer- and 
      short-term effects of temperature exposure on gas exchange patterns. We examined 
      responses of traits of gas exchange [standard metabolic rate (SMR); discontinuous 
      gas exchange (DGE) cycle frequency; cuticular, respiratory and total water loss rate 
      (WLR)] to elucidate the magnitude and form of plastic responses in the dung beetle, 
      Scarabaeus spretus. Results showed that short- and longer-term temperature variation 
      generally have significant effects on SMR and WLR. Overall, acclimation to increased 
      temperature led to a decline in SMR (from 0.071+/-0.004 ml CO(2) h(-1) in 15 degrees 
      C-acclimated beetles to 0.039+/-0.004 ml CO(2) h(-1) in 25 degrees C-acclimated 
      beetles measured at 20 degrees C) modulated by reduced DGE frequency (15 degrees C 
      acclimation: 0.554+/-0.027 mHz, 20 degrees C acclimation: 0.257+/-0.030 mHz, 25 
      degrees C acclimation: 0.208+/-0.027 mHz recorded at 20 degrees C), reduced 
      cuticular WLRs (from 1.058+/-0.537 mg h(-1) in 15 degrees C-acclimated beetles to 
      0.900+/-0.400 mg h(-1) in 25 degrees C-acclimated beetles measured at 20 degrees C) 
      and reduced total WLR (from 4.2+/-0.5 mg h(-1) in 15 degrees C-acclimated beetles to 
      3.1+/-0.5 mg h(-1) in 25 degrees C-acclimated beetles measured at 25 degrees C). 
      Respiratory WLR was reduced from 2.25+/-0.40 mg h(-1) in 15 degrees C-acclimated 
      beetles to 1.60+/-0.40 mg h(-1) in 25 degrees C-acclimated beetles measured at 25 
      degrees C, suggesting conservation of water during DGE bursts. Overall, this 
      suggests water conservation is a priority for S. spretus exposed to longer-term 
      temperature variation, rather than elevation of SMR in response to low temperature 
      acclimation, as might be expected from a beetle living in a relatively warm, low 
      rainfall summer region. These results are significant for understanding the 
      evolution of gas exchange patterns and trade-offs between metabolic rate and water 
      balance in insects and other terrestrial arthropods.

TI  - Gill morphology of the mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is plastic and 
      changes in response to terrestrial air exposure.
PG  - 1109-15
AB  - Amphibious mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus (formerly Rivulus 
      marmoratus), are frequently exposed to aerial conditions in their natural 
      environment. We tested the hypothesis that gill structure is plastic and that 
      metabolic rate is maintained in response to air exposure. During air exposure, when 
      gills are no longer functional, we predicted that gill surface area would decrease. 
      In the first experiment, K. marmoratus were exposed to either water (control) or air 
      for 1 h, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 week followed by a return to water for 1 week 
      (recovery). Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and light micrographs of gill 
      sections were taken, and morphometric analyses of lamellar width, lamellar length 
      and interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) height were performed. Following 1 week of air 
      exposure, SEM indicated that there was a decrease in lamellar surface area. 
      Morphometric analysis of light micrographs revealed that there were significant 
      changes in the height of the ILCM, but there were no significant differences in 
      lamellae width and length between any of the treatments. Following 1 week of 
      recovery in water, the ILCM regressed and gill lamellae were similar to control 
      fish, indicating that the morphological changes were reversible. In the second 
      experiment, V(CO(2)) was measured in fish continuously over a 5-day period in air 
      and compared with previous measurements of oxygen uptake (V(O(2))) in water. 
      V(CO(2)) varied between 6 and 10 micromol g(-1) h(-1) and was significantly higher 
      on days 3, 4 and 5 relative to days 1 and 2. In contrast to V(O(2)) in water, 
      V(CO(2)) in air showed no diurnal rhythm over a 24 h period. These findings indicate 
      that K. marmoratus remodel their gill structures in response to air exposure and 
      that these changes are completely reversible. Furthermore, over a similar time 
      frame, changes in V(CO(2)) indicate that metabolic rate is maintained at a rate 
      comparable to that of fish in water, underlying the remarkable ability of K. 
      marmoratus to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

TI  - Contrasting stomatal sensitivity to temperature and soil drought in mature alpine 
      conifers.
PG  - 1674-1689
LID - 10.1111/pce.13500 [doi]
AB  - Conifers growing at high elevations need to optimize their stomatal conductance 
      (g(s) ) for maximizing photosynthetic yield while minimizing water loss under less 
      favourable thermal conditions. Yet the ability of high-elevation conifers to adjust 
      their g(s) sensitivity to environmental drivers remains largely unexplored. We used 
      4 years of sap flow measurements to elucidate intraspecific and interspecific 
      variability of g(s) in Larix decidua Mill. and Picea abies (L.) Karst along an 
      elevational gradient and contrasting soil moisture conditions. Site- and 
      species-specific g(s) response to main environmental drivers were examined, 
      including vapour pressure deficit, air temperature, solar irradiance, and soil water 
      potential. Our results indicate that maximum g(s) of L. decidua is >2 times higher, 
      shows a more plastic response to temperature, and down-regulates g(s) stronger 
      during atmospheric drought compared to P. abies. These differences allow L. decidua 
      to exert more efficient water use, adjust to site-specific thermal conditions, and 
      reduce water loss during drought episodes. The stronger plasticity of g(s) 
      sensitivity to temperature and higher conductance of L. decidua compared to P. abies 
      provide new insights into species-specific water use strategies, which affect 
      species' performance and should be considered when predicting terrestrial water 
      dynamics under future climatic change.

AB  - The salt marsh beetle Pogonus chalceus has diverged into short- and long-winged 
      populations, which can be found in hundreds of interlaced habitat patches that 
      sharply differ in their hydrological regime. In a recent study, we investigated how 
      a behavioral adaptation to these contrasting hydrological regimes might drive the 
      neat spatial sorting of the ecotypes and facilitate divergence. Simulated inundation 
      experiments revealed that the ecotypes differ in dispersal response toward the 
      hydrological regime and that this is a plastic behavior imprinted during the 
      nondispersive immature stages. In their comment, Akcali and Porter (2017) question 
      if the observed plastic response would effectively reduce gene-flow in this system. 
      Based on the natural history of this species we demonstrate why this is plausible 
      and we propose future avenues that may further strengthen this conclusion. In 
      addition, Akcali and Porter (2017) illustrate some current inconsistencies in the 
      use of terminology of the different habitat choice mechanisms. We agree that proper 
      classification of the existing theories is indispensable in advancing the field of 
      habitat choice mechanisms and their effect on gene flow, but the unique attributes 
      of any given biological system may thwart this exercise.

TI  - Isoflurane anesthesia in the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).
PG  - 39-42
AB  - Isoflurane is one of the safest and most accepted anesthetic agents for reptiles, 
      birds, and mammals. It has also been used in terrestrial amphibians. The use of 
      inhalation agents in an entirely aquatic frog presents a new dilemma for delivery in 
      contrast to terrestrial species. The African Clawed Frog respires by using both 
      transcutaneous gas exchange and air breathing. These frogs remain submerged for long 
      periods of time, thus making standard inhalation techniques impractical. We tested 
      five methods for delivering isoflurane: 1) bubbling isoflurane and oxygen in the 
      water, 2) intracoelomic injection, 3) subcutaneous injection, 4) intramuscular 
      injection, and 5) topical application. For the topical application, we developed a 
      simple technique by using an absorptive pad with a vapor-barrier backing, saturating 
      the pad with the liquid isoflurane, and placing the pad on the back of the frog 
      while it was confined in a plastic bowl. Although two of the three injectable routes 
      induced anesthesia, only the topical route produced rapid induction with consistent, 
      safe recovery. Bubbling isoflurane with oxygen into water was unsuccessful. Topical 
      application of isoflurane was most successful and appears to be a safe and practical 
      method that can be used as an alternative to tricaine methylsulphonate, hypothermia, 
      or other methods for anesthetizing African Clawed Frogs.

AB  - In this study, the quantitative and qualitative compositions of microplastics (MPs) 
      deposited from the atmosphere in the coastal zone were analysed. Moreover, links 
      between MP deposition and meteorological factors (air humidity, wind speed, 
      precipitation height, and air mass trajectories) were investigated. MP deposition 
      samples were collected in the southern Baltic area in 2017 and 2018 for 286 days in 
      total. The morphological features of MPs (shape and size) were analysed using a 
      digital microscope. Qualitative analysis was performed using micro-attenuated total 
      reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (μATR FT-IR). The size of the 
      deposited MPs ranged from 5 μm to 5000 μm, and smaller size classes (<720 μm) were 
      predominant (70%). Fibres were of the dominant type (60%). Films and fragments 
      constituted 26% and 14% of the total MPs, respectively, while 55% of the MPs found 
      in the study were polymers often used in textiles, packaging materials, and fishing 
      gear (polyesters and polypropylene). The atmospheric MP deposition ranged from 
      0 m(-2)·d(-1) to 30 m(-2)·d(-1) (average: 10 ± 8 m(-2)·d(-1); median: 
      8 m(-2)·d(-1)). Based on the air mass trajectory cluster analysis, MPs deposited in 
      Gdynia mainly originated from local sources (<100 km). Furthermore, higher MP 
      deposition occurred when the inflowing air masses were terrestrial, and lower 
      deposition occurred when they were marine. On average, during wet periods twice the 
      amount of MPs was deposited in comparison with dry periods. During dry periods 
      deposition increased with increasing wind speed and was intensified by high relative 
      humidity.

      EPSPs in grape snail neurons].
PG  - 1298-306
AB  - Change in intracellular calcium concentration is the main trigger of majority of 
      physiological processes in the neuron including altering of gene expression and 
      synaptic plasticity. We have found out that high amplitude EPSPs in command neurons 
      of terrestrial snail similar to action potentials were accompanied by prominent 
      calcium transients. It was shown that the amplitude of calcium transients 
      accompanying high amplitude EPSPs in command neurons linearly depends on the 
      strength of synaptic stimulation whereas dynamic of changes of EPSP amplitudes 
      demonstrates pronounced saturation with increase of stimulus intensity. It means 
      that in the certain range of membrane potentials calcium transients more accurately 
      reflect stimulus strength then the level of membrane depolarization. We propose that 
      calcium transients induced by high amplitude EPSPs are able to induce some 
      biochemical changes in the neurons and therefore can mediate cell response at the 
      subthreshold for action potential levels of membrane potential.

TI  - Conserved and narrow temperature limits in alpine insects: Thermal tolerance and 
      supercooling points of the ice-crawlers, Grylloblatta (Insecta: Grylloblattodea: 
      Grylloblattidae).

AB  - For many terrestrial species, habitat associations and range size are dependent on 
      physiological limits, which in turn may influence large-scale patterns of species 
      diversity. The temperature range experienced by individuals is considered to shape 
      the breadth of the thermal niche, with species occupying temporally and/or 
      geographically stable climates tolerating a narrow temperature range. High-elevation 
      environments experience large temperature fluctuations, with frequent periods below 
      0 °C, but Grylloblatta (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae) occupy climatically stable 
      microhabitats within this region. Here we test critical thermal limits and 
      supercooling points for five Grylloblatta populations from across a large geographic 
      area, to examine whether the stable microhabitats of this group are associated with 
      a narrow thermal niche and assess their capacity to tolerate cold conditions. 
      Thermal limits are highly conserved in Grylloblatta, despite substantial genetic 
      divergence among populations spanning 1500 m elevation and being separated by over 
      500 km. Further, Grylloblatta show exceptionally narrow thermal limits compared to 
      other insect taxa with little capacity to improve cold tolerance via plasticity. In 
      contrast, upper thermal limits were significantly depressed by cold acclimation. 
      Grylloblatta maintain coordinated movement until they freeze, and they die upon 
      freezing. Convergence of the critical thermal minima, supercooling point and lower 
      lethal limits point to adaptation to a cold but, importantly, constant thermal 
      environment. These physiological data provide an explanation for the high endemism 
      and patchy distribution of Grylloblatta, which relies on subterranean retreats to 
      accommodate narrow thermal limits. These retreats are currently buffered from 
      temperature fluctuations by snow cover, and a declining snowpack thus places 
      Grylloblatta at risk of exposure to temperatures beyond its tolerance capacity.

TI  - Tolerance to Zinc in Populations of the Earthworm Lumbricus rubellus from 
      Uncontaminated and Metal-Contaminated Ecosystems.
PG  - 332-337
AB  - Zinc tolerance in Lumbricus rubellus populations from two metal-polluted (smelter 
      and mine) sites was studied by comparing the effects of zinc with responses in a 
      reference site strain. For the study, adult worms were collected directly from the 
      field. Thus, no attempt was made to differentiate between tolerance resulting from 
      population-level genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity in metal physiology. To 
      compare relative sensitivity for zinc, worms from the three populations were exposed 
      in laboratory tests. Effects on survival, weight change, cocoon production, and 
      internal zinc levels were measured. Prior to exposure, it was anticipated that worms 
      from the metal-contaminated sites would show substantially increased tolerance to 
      zinc. This was not the case for all measured parameters. Thus, although differences 
      in the shape of the dose-response relationships for survival and cocoon production 
      were found, substantial variations in measured responses, effect concentrations, or 
      zinc accumulation rates were not apparent. Overall, therefore, zinc tolerance is 
      unlikely to be a major factor influencing the distribution of L. rubellus in 
      contaminated 
      regions.http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00244/bibs/37n3p332.html

TI  - Breeding habitat loss reveals limited foraging flexibility and increases foraging 
      effort in a colonial breeding seabird.

LID - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Habitat loss can force animals to relocate to new areas, where they 
      would need to adjust to an unfamiliar resource landscape and find new breeding 
      sites. Relocation may be costly and could compromise reproduction. METHODS: Here, we 
      explored how the Lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), a colonial breeding 
      seabird species with a wide ecological niche, responds to the loss of its breeding 
      habitat. We investigated how individuals adjusted their foraging behaviour after 
      relocating to another colony due to breeding site destruction, and whether there 
      were any reproductive consequences in the first years after relocation. To this end, 
      we compared offspring growth between resident individuals and individuals that 
      recently relocated to the same colony due to breeding habitat loss. Using 
      GPS-tracking, we further investigated the foraging behaviour of resident individuals 
      in both colonies, as well as that of relocated individuals, as enhanced foraging 
      effort could represent a potential driver of reproductive costs. RESULTS: We found 
      negative consequences of relocation for offspring development, which were apparent 
      when brood demand was experimentally increased. Recently relocated gulls travelled 
      further distances for foraging than residents, as they often visited more distant 
      foraging sites used by residents breeding in their natal colony as well as new areas 
      outside the home range of the residents in the colony where they settled. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that relocated individuals did not yet optimally 
      adapt to the new food landscape, which was unexpected, given the social information 
      on foraging locations that may have been available from resident neighbours in their 
      new breeding colony. Even though the short-term reproductive costs were 
      comparatively low, we show that generalist species, such as the Lesser black-backed 
      gull, may be more vulnerable to habitat loss than expected. Long term studies are 
      needed to investigate how long individuals are affected by their relocation in order 
      to better assess potential population effects of (breeding) habitat loss.

LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2018.0125 [doi]
LID - 20180125
AB  - In most ectotherms, adult body size decreases with warming, the so-called 
      'temperature-size rule' (TSR). However, the extent to which the strength of the TSR 
      varies naturally within species is little known, and the significance of this 
      phenomenon for tropical biota has been largely neglected. Here, we show that the 
      adult body mass of the soil mite Rostrozetes ovulum declined as maximum temperature 
      increased over seasons in a central Amazonian rainforest. Further, per cent decline 
      per °C was fourfold higher in riparian than in upland forests, possibly reflecting 
      differences in oxygen and/or resource supply. Adding our results to a global dataset 
      revealed that, across terrestrial arthropods, the seasonal TSR is generally stronger 
      in hotter environments. Our study suggests that size thermal dependence varies 
      predictably with the environment both locally and globally.

AB  - Deer mice in the genus Peromyscus occupy nearly every terrestrial habitat in North 
      America, and have a long history as subjects of behavioral, ecological, 
      evolutionary, and physiological study. Recent advances in transcriptomics, the study 
      of the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by certain cell types or under 
      certain conditions, have contributed to the development of Peromyscus as a model 
      system. We review the recent use of transcriptomics to investigate how natural 
      selection and gene expression plasticity contribute to the existence of deer mice in 
      challenging environments such as highlands, deserts, and cities across North 
      America. Transcriptomics also holds great promise for elucidating the genetic basis 
      of mating systems and other behaviors in Peromyscus, but has to date been 
      underutilized for developmental biology and disease studies. Future Peromyscus 
      studies should apply robust comparative frameworks to analyze the transcriptomics of 
      multiple populations of the same species across varying environmental conditions, as 
      well as multiple species that vary in traits of interest.

LID - 10.1242/jeb.123133 [doi]
AB  - Aquatic hypercapnia may have helped to drive ancestral vertebrate invasion of land. 
      We tested the hypothesis that amphibious fishes sense and respond to elevated 
      aquatic PCO2 by behavioural avoidance mechanisms, and by morphological changes at 
      the chemoreceptor level. Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) were exposed to 
      1 week of normocapnic control water (pH 8), air, hypercapnia (5% CO2, pH 6.8) or 
      isocapnic acidosis (pH 6.8). We found that the density of CO2/H(+) chemoreceptive 
      neuroepithelial cells (NECs) was increased in hypercapnia or isocapnic 
      acidosis-exposed fish. Projection area (a measure of cell size) was unchanged. Acute 
      exposure to progressive hypercapnia induced the fish to emerse (leave water) at 
      water pH values ∼6.1, whereas addition of HCl to water caused a more variable 
      response with a lower pH threshold (∼pH 5.5). These results support our hypothesis 
      and suggest that aquatic hypercapnia provides an adequate stimulus for extant 
      amphibious fishes to temporarily transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.

TI  - Geographic variation in adult and embryonic desiccation tolerance in a 
      terrestrial-breeding frog.
PG  - 1186-1199
LID - 10.1111/evo.13973 [doi]
AB  - Intraspecific variation in the ability of individuals to tolerate environmental 
      perturbations is often neglected when considering the impacts of climate change. Yet 
      this information is potentially crucial for mitigating deleterious effects of 
      climate change on threatened species. Here we assessed patterns of intraspecific 
      variation in desiccation tolerance in the frog Pseudophryne guentheri, a 
      terrestrial-breeding species experiencing a drying climate. Adult frogs were 
      collected from six populations across a rainfall gradient and their dehydration and 
      rehydration rates were assessed. We also compared desiccation tolerance of embryos 
      and hatchlings originating from within-population parental crosses from four of the 
      populations. Embryos were reared on soil at three soil-water potentials and their 
      desiccation tolerance was assessed across a range of traits. We found significant 
      and strong patterns of intraspecific variation in almost all traits, both in adults 
      and first-generation offspring. Adult frogs exhibited clinal variation in their 
      water balance responses, with populations from drier sites both dehydrating and 
      rehydrating more slowly compared to frogs from more mesic sites. Similarly, 
      desiccation tolerance of first-generation offspring was significantly greater in 
      populations from xeric sites. Our findings suggest that populations within this 
      species will respond differently to the regional reduction in rainfall predicted by 
      climate change models.

TI  - Coherent network oscillations by olfactory interneurons: modulation by endogenous 
      amines.
PG  - 1930-9
AB  - 1. The procerebral (PC) lobe of the terrestrial mollusk Limax maximus contains a 
      highly interconnected network of local olfactory interneurons that receives direct 
      axonal projections from the two pairs of noses. This olfactory processing network 
      generates a 0.7-Hz oscillation in its local field potential (LFP) that is coherent 
      throughout the network. The oscillating LFP is modulated by natural odorants applied 
      to the neuroepithelium of the superior nose. 2. Two amines known to be present in 
      the PC lobe, dopamine and serotonin, increase the frequency of the PC lobe 
      oscillation and alter its waveform. 3. Glutamate, another putative neurotransmitter 
      known to be present in the lobe, suppresses the PC lobe oscillation by a 
      quisqualate-type receptor and appears to be used by one of the two classes of 
      neurons in the PC lobe to generate the basic LFP oscillation. 4. The known 
      activation of second messengers in Limax PC lobe by dopamine and serotonin together 
      with their effects on the oscillatory rhythm suggest the hypothesis that these 
      amines augment mechanisms mediating synaptic plasticity in the olfactory network, 
      similar to hypothesized effects of amines in vertebrate olfactory systems. 5. The 
      use of a distributed network of interneurons showing coherent oscillations may 
      relate to the highly developed odor recognition and odor learning ability of Limax.

TI  - Intraspecific variation shapes community-level behavioral responses to urbanization 
      in spiders.
PG  - 2379-2390
LID - 10.1002/ecy.1915 [doi]
AB  - Urban areas are an extreme example of human-changed environments, exposing organisms 
      to multiple and strong selection pressures. Adaptive behavioral responses are 
      thought to play a major role in animals' success or failure in such new 
      environments. Approaches based on functional traits have proven especially valuable 
      to understand how species communities respond to environmental gradients. Until 
      recently, they have, however, often ignored the potential consequences of 
      intraspecific trait variation (ITV). When ITV is prevalent, it may highly impact 
      ecological processes and resilience against stressors. This may be especially 
      relevant in animals, in which behavioral traits can be altered very flexibly at the 
      individual level to track environmental changes. We investigated how species 
      turnover and ITV influenced community-level behavioral responses in a set of 62 
      sites of varying levels of urbanization, using orb web spiders and their webs as 
      models of foraging behavior. ITV alone explained around one-third of the total trait 
      variation observed among communities. Spider web structure changed according to 
      urbanization, in ways that increase the capture efficiency of webs in a context of 
      smaller urban prey. These trait shifts were partly mediated by species turnover, but 
      ITV increased their magnitude, potentially helping to buffer the effects of 
      environmental changes on communities. The importance of ITV varied depending on 
      traits and on the spatial scale at which urbanization was considered. Despite being 
      neglected from community-level analyses in animals, our results highlight the 
      importance of accounting for intraspecific trait variation to fully understand trait 
      responses to (human-induced) environmental changes and their impact on ecosystem 
      functioning.

TI  - Water relations of tetrapod integument.
PG  - 202-26
AB  - The vertebrate integument represents an evolutionary compromise between the needs 
      for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment and regulating the 
      exchange of materials and energy. Fibrous keratins evolved as a means of 
      strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for 
      lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in 
      terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers, 
      the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that 
      enhance or maintain the integrity of function. Amphibians are exceptional among 
      tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective 
      lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats 
      are external to the epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a 
      lipid-keratin complex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of 
      the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial 
      aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding the stratum corneum with 
      superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be 
      relatively fixed, although various species have ;plasticity' to adjust the barrier 
      effectiveness facultatively. While it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and 
      genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin 
      resistance to water efflux, studies of the relative importance of these two 
      phenomena are few. Fundamental mechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier 
      include changes in barrier thickness, composition and physicochemical properties of 
      cutaneous lipids, and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While 
      cutaneous lipids have been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and 
      cosmetics, relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrier 
      ontogenesis related to adaptation and environment. Advances in such knowledge have 
      didactic significance for understanding vertebrate evolution as well as practical 
      application to clinical dermatology.

AB  - With the increasing application of molecular techniques for diatom species discovery 
      and identification, it is important both from a taxonomic as well as an ecological 
      and applied perspective, to understand in which groups morphological species 
      delimitation is congruent with molecular approaches, or needs reconsideration. 
      Moreover, such studies can improve our understanding of morphological trait 
      evolution in this important group of microalgae. In this study, we used morphometric 
      analysis on light microscopy (LM) micrographs in SHERPA, detailed scanning electron 
      microscopy (SEM), and cytological observations in LM to examine 70 clones belonging 
      to eight distinct molecular lineages of the cosmopolitan terrestrial diatom 
      Pinnularia borealis. Due to high within-lineage variation, no conclusive 
      morphological separation in LM nor SEM could be detected. Morphological stasis due 
      to the "low-morphology" problem or stabilizing selection, as well as 
      parallel/convergent evolution, phenotypic plasticity and structural inheritance are 
      discussed as potential drivers for the observations. Altogether, P. borealis is 
      truly cryptic, in contrast to the majority of other diatom species complexes which 
      turned out to be pseudo-cryptic following detailed morphological analysis.

TI  - Histone deacetylase inhibitors rescue the impaired memory in terrestrial snails.
PG  - 639-649
LID - 10.1007/s00359-020-01422-w [doi]
AB  - It is becoming increasingly clear that the long-term plasticity can be regulated via 
      histone modifications. Many studies demonstrated the role of histone acetylation in 
      acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of long-term memory. Nonetheless, the role 
      of histone acetylation in memory reinstatement following its disruption by 
      antimnemonic treatments was not studied in details. In terrestrial snails, we 
      examined effects of the histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi) sodium butyrate 
      (NaB) and trichostatin A (TSA) on reinstatement of the context fear memory impaired 
      by antimnemonic agents such as protein synthesis blocker anisomycin 
      (ANI) + reminding or a specific inhibitor of protein-kinase Mζ, zeta inhibitory 
      peptide (ZIP). It was observed that both NaB and TSA applications restored the 
      ANI-impaired context memory regardless of memory reactivation, while a combination 
      of NaB or TSA plus memory reactivation (or additional training) was necessary for 
      the effective reinstatement of the ZIP-impaired memory. Additionally, NaB injections 
      significantly facilitated development of long-term memory in animals with weak 
      memory, while no effect was observed in animals with strong memory. The data 
      obtained confirmed the assumption that histone acetylation is a critical regulatory 
      component of memory development and reinstatement.

TI  - The first report on the source-to-sink characterization of microplastic pollution

AB  - Microplastics are plastic pieces <5 mm in size that are more harmful than large 
      plastic debris. The world's oceans contain large amounts of these particles, and 
      their presence is severely affecting the marine organisms. Smaller aquatic organisms 
      ingesting microplastics, mistaking them for food, and their subsequent entry into 
      the food chain is of significant concern. Rivers are major carriers of these 
      materials from the terrestrial environment to the oceans. In this study, for the 
      first time, we have done the source-to-sink characterization of microplastics 
      (5 mm-0.3 mm) for a tropical Indian river, namely the Netravathi River, which 
      debouches into the Arabian Sea. Here, we present a detailed investigation made on 
      water, sediments and soil samples collected from the river catchment. All the 
      samples showed the presence of microplastics with a mean numerical abundance of 
      288 pieces/m(3) (water), 96 pieces/kg (sediment) and 84.45 pieces/kg (soil). Fibres, 
      films and fragments are the main categories obtained from the catchment. The 
      microplastics present in the samples were mostly transparent and white coloured 
      which are due to the decay of plastic carry bags, packing materials and fishing 
      lines. Different coloured microplastics were also present in lesser numbers. 
      Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are the most abundant 
      polymers present in the samples. Fragmentation of larger plastic materials which is 
      due to mismanaged solid waste and garment washing are the primary sources of these 
      materials in the river catchment. Moreover, the sampling sites near to important 
      pilgrim centres like Dharmasthala and Subrahmanya, register higher concentration of 
      fibres released due to washing of clothes. The study concludes that the Netravathi 
      River is contaminated with microplastics from its origin to the sink. However, the 
      spatial distribution and abundance of microplastic particles demonstrate the 
      influence of population distribution, land use and good household practices of waste 
      management in some areas.

TI  - Fin and body neuromuscular coordination changes during walking and swimming in 
      Polypterus senegalus.
LID - jeb168716 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.168716 [doi]
AB  - The ability to modulate the function of muscle is integral to an animal's ability to 
      function effectively in the face of widely disparate challenges. This modulation of 
      function can manifest through short-term changes in neuromuscular control, but also 
      through long-term changes in force profiles, fatiguability and architecture. 
      However, the relative extent to which shorter-term modulation and longer-term 
      plasticity govern locomotor flexibility remains unclear. Here, we obtain 
      simultaneously recorded kinematic and muscle activity data of fin and body 
      musculature of an amphibious fish, Polypterus senegalus After examining swimming and 
      walking behaviour in aquatically raised individuals, we show that walking behaviour 
      is characterized by greater absolute duration of muscle activity in most muscles 
      when compared with swimming, but that the magnitude of recruitment during walking is 
      only increased in the secondary bursts of fin muscle and in the primary burst of the 
      mid-body point. This localized increase in intensity suggests that walking in P. 
      senegalus is powered in a few key locations on the fish, contrasting with the more 
      distributed, low intensity muscle force that characterizes the stroke cycle during 
      swimming. Finally, the increased intensity in secondary, but not primary, bursts of 
      the fin muscles when walking probably underscores the importance of antagonistic 
      muscle activity to prevent fin collapse, add stabilization and increase body 
      support. Understanding the principles that underlie the flexibility of muscle 
      function can provide key insights into the sources of animal functional and 
      behavioural diversity.

LID - 353
AB  - Although in nature most microorganisms are known to occur predominantly in consortia 
      or biofilms, data on archaeal biofilm formation are in general scarce. Here, the 
      ability of three methanoarchaeal strains, Methanobrevibacter smithii and 
      Methanosphaera stadtmanae, which form part of the human gut microbiota, and the 
      Methanosarcina mazei strain Gö1 to grow on different surfaces and form biofilms was 
      investigated. All three strains adhered to the substrate mica and grew predominantly 
      as bilayers on its surface as demonstrated by confocal laser scanning microscopy 
      analyses, though the formation of multi-layered biofilms of Methanosphaera 
      stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii was observed as well. Stable biofilm 
      formation was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. 
      Methanosarcina mazei and Methanobrevibacter smithii also formed multi-layered 
      biofilms in uncoated plastic μ-dishes(TM), which were very similar in morphology and 
      reached a height of up to 40 μm. In contrast, biofilms formed by Methanosphaera 
      stadtmanae reached only a height of 2 μm. Staining with the two lectins ConA and IB4 
      indicated that all three strains produced relatively low amounts of extracellular 
      polysaccharides most likely containing glucose, mannose, and galactose. Taken 
      together, this study provides the first evidence that methanoarchaea can develop and 
      form biofilms on different substrates and thus, will contribute to our knowledge on 
      the appearance and physiological role of Methanobrevibacter smithii and 
      Methanosphaera stadtmanae in the human intestine.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability limit plant growth in most terrestrial 
      ecosystems. This review examines how variation in the relative availability of N and 
      P, as reflected by N : P ratios of plant biomass, influences vegetation composition 
      and functioning. Plastic responses of plants to N and P supply cause up to 50-fold 
      variation in biomass N : P ratios, associated with differences in root allocation, 
      nutrient uptake, biomass turnover and reproductive output. Optimal N : P ratios - 
      those of plants whose growth is equally limited by N and P - depend on species, 
      growth rate, plant age and plant parts. At vegetation level, N : P ratios <10 and 
      >20 often (not always) correspond to N- and P-limited biomass production, as shown 
      by short-term fertilization experiments; however long-term effects of fertilization 
      or effects on individual species can be different. N : P ratios are on average 
      higher in graminoids than in forbs, and in stress-tolerant species compared with 
      ruderals; they correlate negatively with the maximal relative growth rates of 
      species and with their N-indicator values. At vegetation level, N : P ratios often 
      correlate negatively with biomass production; high N : P ratios promote graminoids 
      and stress tolerators relative to other species, whereas relationships with species 
      richness are not consistent. N : P ratios are influenced by global change, increased 
      atmospheric N deposition, and conservation managment. Contents Summary 243 I

TI  - Identification and Analysis of OVATE Family Members from Genome of the Early Land 
      Plants Provide Insights into Evolutionary History of OFP Family and Function.

AB  - Mosses, liverworts, hornworts and lycophytes represent transition stages between the 
      aquatic to terrestrial/land plants. Several morphological and adaptive novelties 
      driven by genomic components including emergence and expansion of new or existing 
      gene families have played a critical role during and after the transition, and 
      contributed towards successful colonization of terrestrial ecosystems. It is crucial 
      to decipher the evolutionary transitions and natural selection on the gene structure 
      and function to understand the emergence of phenotypic and adaptive diversity. 
      Plants at the "transition zone", between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem, are also 
      the most vulnerable because of climate change and may contain clues for successful 
      mitigation of the challenges of climate change. Identification and comparative 
      analyses of such genetic elements and gene families are few in mosses, liverworts, 
      hornworts and lycophytes. Ovate family proteins (OFPs) are plant-specific 
      transcriptional repressors and are acknowledged for their roles in important growth 
      and developmental processes in land plants, and information about the functional 
      aspects of OFPs in early land plants is fragmentary. As a first step towards 
      addressing this gap, a comprehensive in silico analysis was carried out utilizing 
      publicly available genome sequences of Marchantia polymorpha (Mp), Physcomitrella 
      patens (Pp), Selaginella moellendorffii (Sm) and Sphagnum fallax (Sf). Our analysis 
      led to the identification of 4 MpOFPs, 19 PpOFPs, 6 SmOFPs and 3 SfOFPs. 
      Cross-genera analysis revealed a drastic change in the structure and physiochemical 
      properties in OFPs suggesting functional diversification and genomic plasticity 
      during the evolutionary course. Knowledge gained from this comparative analysis will 
      form the framework towards deciphering and dissection of their developmental and 
      adaptive role/s in early land plants and could provide insights into evolutionary 
      strategies adapted by land plants.

TI  - Does interspecific competition affect offspring provisioning?
PG  - 487-95
AB  - Offspring size is one of the most well-studied life-history traits, yet it is 
      remarkable that few field studies have examined the manner in which the relationship 
      between offspring size and performance (and thus, optimal offspring size) is 
      affected by the local environment. Furthermore, while offspring size appears to be 
      plastic in a range of organisms, few studies have linked changes in offspring size 
      to changes in the relationship between offspring size and performance in the field. 
      Interspecific competition is a major ecological force in both terrestrial and marine 
      environments, but we have little understanding of its role in shaping selection on 
      offspring size. Here we examine the effect of interspecific competition on the 
      relationship between offspring size and performance in the field for the marine 
      bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata along the south coast of Australia. Both 
      interspecific competition and offspring size had strong effects on the 
      post-metamorphic performance of offspring in the field, but importantly, they acted 
      independently. While interspecific competition did not affect the offspring 
      size-performance relationship, mothers experiencing competition still produced 
      larger offspring than mothers that did not experience competition. Because larger 
      offspring are more dispersive in this species, increasing offspring size may 
      represent a maternal strategy whereby mothers produce more dispersive offspring when 
      they experience high competition themselves. This study shows that, while offspring 
      size is plastic in this species, post-metamorphic factors alone may not determine 
      the size of offspring that mothers produce.

AB  - Slow coincidence circuits for the anti-coincidence measurements have been considered 
      for use in Compton suppression technique. The simplified version of the slow circuit 
      has been found to be fast enough, satisfactory and allows an easy system setup, 
      particularly with the advantage of the automatic threshold setting of the low-level 
      discrimination. A well-type NaI detector as the main detector surrounded by plastic 
      guard detector has been arranged to investigate the performance of the Compton 
      suppression spectrometer using the simplified slow circuit. The system has been 
      tested to observe the improvement in the energy spectra for medium to high-energy 
      gamma-ray photons from terrestrial and environmental samples.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are compounds that interfere with the 
      expression, synthesis, and activity of hormones in organisms. They are released into 
      the environment from flame retardants and products containing plasticizers. 
      Persistent pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and 
      hexachlorobenzene, also disrupt the endocrine system through interaction with 
      hormone receptors. Endogenous hormones, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), are released in 
      the urine and feces of farm animals and seep into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems 
      through sewage. Pigs are widely used as animal models to determine the effects of 
      EDCs because they are physiologically, biochemically, and histologically similar to 
      humans. EDCs primarily disrupt the reproductive and nervous systems of pigs. 
      Moreover, embryonic development during the prenatal and early postnatal periods is 
      particularly sensitive to EDCs. Mycotoxins, such as zearalenone, are food 
      contaminants that alter hormonal activities in pigs. Mycotoxins also alter the 
      innate immune system in pigs, making them vulnerable to diseases. It has been 
      reported that farm animals are exposed to various types of EDCs, which accumulate in 
      tissues, such as those of gonads, livers, and intestines. There is a lack of an 
      integrated understanding of the impact of EDCs on porcine reproduction and 
      development. Thus, this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of literature 
      regarding the effects of EDCs in pigs.

TI  - Microbial degradation of organophosphorus compounds.
PG  - 428-71
AB  - Synthetic organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, plasticizers, air fuel 
      ingredients and chemical warfare agents. Organophosphorus compounds are the most 
      widely used insecticides, accounting for an estimated 34% of world-wide insecticide 
      sales. Contamination of soil from pesticides as a result of their bulk handling at 
      the farmyard or following application in the field or accidental release may lead 
      occasionally to contamination of surface and ground water. Several reports suggest 
      that a wide range of water and terrestrial ecosystems may be contaminated with 
      organophosphorus compounds. These compounds possess high mammalian toxicity and it 
      is therefore essential to remove them from the environments. In addition, about 
      200,000 metric tons of nerve (chemical warfare) agents have to be destroyed 
      world-wide under Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). Bioremediation can offer an 
      efficient and cheap option for decontamination of polluted ecosystems and 
      destruction of nerve agents. The first micro-organism that could degrade 
      organophosphorus compounds was isolated in 1973 and identified as Flavobacterium sp. 
      Since then several bacterial and a few fungal species have been isolated which can 
      degrade a wide range of organophosphorus compounds in liquid cultures and soil 
      systems. The biochemistry of organophosphorus compound degradation by most of the 
      bacteria seems to be identical, in which a structurally similar enzyme called 
      organophosphate hydrolase or phosphotriesterase catalyzes the first step of the 
      degradation. organophosphate hydrolase encoding gene opd (organophosphate degrading) 
      gene has been isolated from geographically different regions and taxonomically 
      different species. This gene has been sequenced, cloned in different organisms, and 
      altered for better activity and stability. Recently, genes with similar function but 
      different sequences have also been isolated and characterized. Engineered 
      microorganisms have been tested for their ability to degrade different 
      organophosphorus pollutants, including nerve agents. In this article, we review and 
      propose pathways for degradation of some organophosphorus compounds by 
      microorganisms. Isolation, characterization, utilization and manipulation of the 
      major detoxifying enzymes and the molecular basis of degradation are discussed. The 
      major achievements and technological advancements towards bioremediation of 
      organophosphorus compounds, limitations of available technologies and future 
      challenge are also discussed.

AB  - We studied the abundance of seafloor litter in the bay of Bejaia, Algeria, in order 
      to better understand its sources and distribution and provide scientists with the 
      technical basis for further monitoring and reduction measures. Data were collected 
      during trawl surveys dedicated to fishing activity, between 40 and 200m. After each 
      trawl, litter items were manually sorted and analyzed. The highest concentration of 
      58,998 items/ha was recorded to the east of the bay. Overall, plastic was the 
      dominant component of the litter with 88% of the total amount, in weight. Most of 
      the waste was of terrestrial origin, with rivers and beaches being the main sources 
      due to population density, highly developed tourism during the summer season, and 
      inadequate waste management. Overall, the results provide relevant benchmarks for 
      future monitoring and are discussed in terms of poor waste management, a critical 
      issue in the region.

TI  - Orchids do not pay costs at emergence for prolonged dormancy.
PG  - 1538-43
AB  - In plants, prolonged dormancy is often considered a response to resource depletion 
      or environmental stress that comes at a fitness cost. However, apparent costs of 
      dormancy could reflect the state in which plants entered dormancy, rather than 
      effects of dormancy per se. We tested this hypothesis for a terrestrial orchid, 
      Epipactis atrorubens, by analyzing differences in vital rates of dormant and 
      emergent plants using generalized linear mixed models, applied to eight years of 
      demographic data. Dormant E. atrorubens plants did not form one homogeneous stage 
      class. Instead, the vital rates of dormant plants mirrored performance of plants in 
      their life stage before dormancy. Plants emerging from dormancy were slightly 
      (albeit only marginally statistically significantly) larger than plants 
      transitioning from the matching aboveground stage class, especially for smaller and 
      younger stage classes. Because small plants were most likely to go dormant, plants 
      emerging from dormancy were also smaller than average, if one were to compare all 
      previously dormant plants to all previously emergent plants. Therefore, 
      misclassifying all dormant plants into a single stage class changes whether we view 
      dormancy as intrinsically costly, in terms of future performance upon emergence. We 
      suggest that prolonged dormancy may be a form of phenotypic plasticity in which 
      plants distribute their performance and reproductive effort through time, rather 
      than a simple stress response.

TI  - Evidence of short-term adaptation to microgravity of neuromuscular synergy during a 
      whole body movement.
PG  - P167-8
AB  - Human, like any other animal systems, moves in the terrestrial gravity field and 
      must learn gravity-related motor strategies during his ontogenetic development. 
      Considering continuous gravity action upon body segments, movement involves 
      particular muscle activation patterns depending on body orientation to gravity. 
      Gravitational-altered environments provided by parabolic flight or orbital space 
      mission offer a great opportunity to investigate how gravity is taken into account 
      in posture and movement planning. Indeed, in a context where the mechanical 
      constraints are modified, movement execution involves that new muscular activity 
      have to be produced. Almost, only few studies in microgravity environment are 
      included electromyographic analysis and this parameter is generally used only to 
      confirm modification of the muscular activation patterns. This study is focused to 
      analyse the adaptation capacity of the brain to a modified gravitational 
      environment. In this aim, EMG activity have been recorded during a whole body 
      movement execution in both normo- and microgravity environment during parabolic 
      flight. This procedure allowed us to analyse the EMG patterns recorded during the 
      very first moments of weightlessness. In this study are reported the results of this 
      analyse.

PG  - 436-42

AB  - Currently, there are a large number of products (sunscreen, pigments, cosmetics, 
      plastics, toothpastes and photocatalysts) that use TiO(2) nanoparticles. Due to this 
      large production, these nanoparticles can be released into the aquatic, terrestrial 
      and aerial environments at relative high concentration. TiO(2) in natural water has 
      the capacity to harm aquatic organisms such as the Daphnia (Cladocera) species, 
      mainly because the photocatalytic properties of this semiconductor. However, very 
      few toxicity tests of TiO(2) nanoparticles have been conducted under irradiation. 
      The aim of this study was to evaluate anatase and rutile TiO(2) toxicity to Daphnia 
      similis exploring their photocatalytic properties by incorporating UV A and visible 
      radiation as a parameter in the assays. Anatase and rutile TiO(2) samples at the 
      highest concentration tested (100 mg L(-1)) were not toxic to D. similis, neither in 
      the dark nor under visible light conditions. The anatase form and a mixture of 
      anatase and rutile, when illuminated by a UV A black light with a peak emission 
      wavelength of 360 nm, presented photo-dependent EC50 values of 56.9-7.8 mg L(-1), 
      which indicates a toxicity mechanism caused by ROS (reactive oxygen species) 
      generation.

TI  - Thermal plasticity in postembryonic life history traits of a widely distributed 
      Collembola: Effects of macroclimate and microhabitat on genotypic differences.
PG  - 8100-8112
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3333 [doi]
AB  - Life history traits in many ectotherms show complex patterns of variation among 
      conspecific populations sampled along wide latitudinal or climatic gradients. 
      However, few studies have assessed whether these patterns can be explained better by 
      thermal reaction norms of multiple life history traits, covering major aspects of 
      the life cycle. In this study, we compared five populations of a Holarctic, 
      numerically dominant soil microarthropod species, Folsomia quadrioculata, sampled 
      from a wide latitudinal gradient (56-81°N), for growth, development, fecundity, and 
      survival across four temperatures (10, 15, 20, and 25°C) in common garden 
      experiments. We evaluated the extent to which macroclimate could explain differences 
      in thermal adaptation and life history strategies among populations. The common 
      garden experiments revealed large genotypic differences among populations in all the 
      traits, which were little explained by latitude and macroclimate. In addition, the 
      life history strategies (traits combined) hardly revealed any systematic difference 
      related to latitude and macroclimate. The overall performance of the northernmost 
      population from the most stochastic microclimate and the southernmost population, 
      which remains active throughout the year, was least sensitive to the temperature 
      treatments. In contrast, performance of the population from the most predictable 
      microclimate peaked within a narrow temperature range (around 15°C). Our findings 
      revealed limited support for macroclimate-based predictions, and indicated that 
      local soil habitat conditions related to predictability and seasonality might have 
      considerable influence on the evolution of life history strategies of 
      F. quadrioculata. This study highlights the need to combine knowledge on 
      microhabitat characteristics, and demography, with findings from common garden 
      experiments, for identifying the key drivers of life history evolution across large 
      spatial scales, and wide climate gradients. We believe that similar approaches may 
      substantially improve the understanding of adaptation in many terrestrial ectotherms 
      with low dispersal ability.

TI  - Temperature-size responses alter food chain persistence across environmental 
      gradients.
PG  - 852-862
LID - 10.1111/ele.12779 [doi]
AB  - Body-size reduction is a ubiquitous response to global warming alongside changes in 
      species phenology and distributions. However, ecological consequences of 
      temperature-size (TS) responses for community persistence under environmental change 
      remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of warming, 
      enrichment, community size structure and TS responses on a three-species food chain 
      using a temperature-dependent model with empirical parameterisation. We found that 
      TS responses often increase community persistence, mainly by modifying 
      consumer-resource size ratios and thereby altering interaction strengths and 
      energetic efficiencies. However, the sign and magnitude of these effects vary with 
      warming and enrichment levels, TS responses of constituent species, and community 
      size structure. We predict that the consequences of TS responses are stronger in 
      aquatic than in terrestrial ecosystems, especially when species show different TS 
      responses. We conclude that considering the links between phenotypic plasticity, 
      environmental drivers and species interactions is crucial to better predict global 
      change impacts on ecosystem diversity and stability.

TI  - Role of water flow regime in the swimming behaviour and escape performance of a 
      schooling fish.
LID - 10.1242/bio.031997 [doi]
LID - bio031997
AB  - Animals are exposed to variable and rapidly changing environmental flow conditions, 
      such as wind in terrestrial habitats and currents in aquatic systems. For fishes, 
      previous work suggests that individuals exhibit flow-induced changes in aerobic 
      swimming performance. Yet, no one has examined whether similar plasticity is found 
      in fast-start escape responses, which are modulated by anaerobic swimming 
      performance, sensory stimuli and neural control. In this study, we used fish from 
      wild schools of the tropical damselfish Chromis viridis from shallow reefs 
      surrounding Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The flow regime at 
      each site was measured to ascertain differences in mean water flow speed and its 
      temporal variability. Swimming and escape behaviour in fish schools were 
      video-recorded in a laminar-flow swim tunnel. Though each school's swimming 
      behaviour (i.e. alignment and cohesion) was not associated with local flow 
      conditions, traits linked with fast-start performance (particularly turning rate and 
      the distance travelled with the response) were significantly greater in individuals 
      from high-flow habitats. This stronger performance may occur due to a number of 
      mechanisms, such as an i n s itu training effect or greater selection pressure for 
      faster performance phenotypes in areas with high flow speed.This article has an 
      associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

TI  - Transcription, Signaling Receptor Activity, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Fatty 
      Acid Metabolism Mediate the Presence of Closely Related Species in Distinct 
      Intertidal and Cold-Seep Habitats.
PG  - 51-69
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evv242 [doi]
AB  - Bathyal cold seeps are isolated extreme deep-sea environments characterized by low 
      species diversity while biomass can be high. The Håkon Mosby mud volcano (Barents 
      Sea, 1,280 m) is a rather stable chemosynthetic driven habitat characterized by 
      prominent surface bacterial mats with high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen 
      levels. Here, the nematode Halomonhystera hermesi thrives in high abundances (11,000 
      individuals 10 cm(-2)). Halomonhystera hermesi is a member of the intertidal 
      Halomonhystera disjuncta species complex that includes five cryptic species (GD1-5). 
      GD1-5's common habitat is characterized by strong environmental fluctuations. Here, 
      we compared the transcriptomes of H. hermesi and GD1, H. hermesi's closest relative. 
      Genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are more strongly 
      expressed in H. hermesi than in GD1, and many genes were only observed in H. hermesi 
      while being completely absent in GD1. Both observations could in part be attributed 
      to high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Additionally, fatty acid 
      elongation was also prominent in H. hermesi confirming the importance of highly 
      unsaturated fatty acids in this species. Significant higher amounts of transcription 
      factors and genes involved in signaling receptor activity were observed in GD1 (many 
      of which were completely absent in H. hermesi), allowing fast signaling and 
      transcriptional reprogramming which can mediate survival in dynamic intertidal 
      environments. GC content was approximately 8% higher in H. hermesi coding unigenes 
      resulting in differential codon usage between both species and a higher proportion 
      of amino acids with GC-rich codons in H. hermesi. In general our results showed that 
      most pathways were active in both environments and that only three genes are under 
      natural selection. This indicates that also plasticity should be taken in 
      consideration in the evolutionary history of Halomonhystera species. Such 
      plasticity, as well as possible preadaptation to low oxygen and high sulfide levels 
      might have played an important role in the establishment of a cold-seep 
      Halomonhystera population.

TI  - [Biological Effects of ZnO Nanoparticles as Influenced by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal 
      Inoculation and Phosphorus Fertilization].
PG  - 3208-3215
LID - 10.13277/j.hjkx.2016.08.049 [doi]
AB  - ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used in many applications, such as plastics, 
      ceramics, glass, cement, rubber, lubricants, paints, pigments, batteries, fire 
      retardants, catalysts, and anti-microbial agents. They directly or indirectly enter 
      aquatic and terrestrial environments through application, accidental release, 
      contaminated soil/sediments, or atmospheric fallouts. When present in excess, ZnO 
      NPs can induce phytotoxicity and reduce plant growth and yields. ZnO NPs can also 
      cause Zn accumulation in edible parts of food crops, and then subsequently enter 
      human bodies and pose a significant health risk. Arbuscular mycorrhizae are 
      ubiquitous symbiotic associations in nature formed between arbuscular mycorrhizal 
      (AM) fungi and most higher plants in terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to their 
      well-known contribution to plant nutrient acquisition and growth, AM fungi can 
      improve plant tolerance to various environmental stresses, but mycorrhizal effects 
      vary with environmental conditions such as phosphorus status in both soil and 
      plants. AM fungi have been shown to alleviate the negative effects of ZnO NPs and 
      zinc accumulation in plants, however, the role of phosphorus fertilization has been 
      neglected. A greenhouse pot culture experiment was conducted using maize as the test 
      plant inoculated with or without AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Four levels of 
      phosphorus (0, 20, 50 or 100 mg·kg(-1)) and two levels of ZnO NPs (0 or 500 
      mg·kg(-1)) were applied to pots. Shoots and roots were harvested separately after 
      two months of growth. Mycorrhizal infection, plant biomass, P and Zn concentrations 
      and uptake in plants, and soil DTPA-extractable zinc and pH were determined. The 
      results showed that ZnO NPs did not significantly affect the growth of maize, but 
      inhibited root mycorrhizal infection and plant phosphorus uptake, and led to the 
      accumulation of zinc in plants. ZnO NPs and high phosphorus supply decreased root 
      mycorrhizal infection, but AM inoculation significantly promoted plant growth under 
      all phosphorus supply levels. Phosphorus application and AM inoculation increased 
      soil pH, but reduced the bioavailability of Zn derived from ZnO NPs, decreased the 
      translocation and accumulation of zinc in maize shoots, and thus produced beneficial 
      effects on plants. In general, AM inoculation showed positive mycorrhizal effect, 
      especially under low phosphorus conditions and addition of ZnO NPs. Our results 
      showed for the first time that both AM fungi and phosphate fertilizer could help to 
      mitigate soil pollution and the ecological and health risks posed by ZnO NPs.

TI  - Trade-Offs in Cold Resistance at the Northern Range Edge of the Common Woodland Ant 
      Aphaenogaster picea (Formicidae).
PG  - E151-E163
LID - 10.1086/705939 [doi]
AB  - Geographic variation in low temperatures at poleward range margins of terrestrial 
      species often mirrors population variation in cold resistance, suggesting that range 
      boundaries may be set by evolutionary constraints on cold physiology. The 
      northeastern woodland ant Aphaenogaster picea occurs up to approximately 45°N in 
      central Maine. We combined presence/absence surveys with classification tree 
      analysis to characterize its northern range limit and assayed two measures of cold 
      resistance operating on different timescales to determine whether and how marginal 
      populations adapt to environmental extremes. The range boundary of A. picea was 
      predicted primarily by temperature, but low winter temperatures did not emerge as 
      the primary correlate of species occurrence. Low summer temperatures and high 
      seasonal variability predicted absence above the boundary, whereas high mean annual 
      temperature (MAT) predicted presence in southern Maine. In contrast, assays of cold 
      resistance across multiple sites were consistent with the hypothesis of local cold 
      adaptation at the range edge: among populations, there was a 4-min reduction in 
      chill coma recovery time across a 2° reduction in MAT. Baseline resistance and 
      capacity for additional plastic cold hardening shifted in opposite directions, with 
      hardening capacity approaching zero at the coldest sites. This trade-off between 
      baseline resistance and cold-hardening capacity suggests that populations at range 
      edges may adapt to colder temperatures through genetic assimilation of plastic 
      responses, potentially constraining further adaptation and range expansion.

TI  - Comparison of different preparation methods of biological samples for FIB milling 
      and SEM investigation.
PG  - 309-19
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03121.x [doi]
AB  - When a new approach in microscopy is introduced, broad interest is attracted only 
      when the sample preparation procedure is elaborated and the results compared with 
      the outcome of the existing methods. In the work presented here we tested different 
      preparation procedures for focused ion beam (FIB) milling and scanning electron 
      microscopy (SEM) of biological samples. The digestive gland epithelium of a 
      terrestrial crustacean was prepared in a parallel for FIB/SEM and transmission 
      electron microscope (TEM). All samples were aldehyde-fixed but followed by different 
      further preparation steps. The results demonstrate that the FIB/SEM samples prepared 
      for conventional scanning electron microscopy (dried) is suited for characterization 
      of those intracellular morphological features, which have membranous/lamellar 
      appearance and structures with composition of different density as the rest of the 
      cell. The FIB/SEM of dried samples did not allow unambiguous recognition of cellular 
      organelles. However, cellular organelles can be recognized by FIB/SEM when samples 
      are embedded in plastic as for TEM and imaged by backscattered electrons. The best 
      results in terms of topographical contrast on FIB milled dried samples were obtained 
      when samples were aldehyde-fixed and conductively stained with the OTOTO method 
      (osmium tetroxide/thiocarbohydrazide/osmium tetroxide/thiocarbohydrazide/osmium 
      tetroxide). In the work presented here we provide evidence that FIB/SEM enables 
      both, detailed recognition of cell ultrastructure, when samples are plastic embedded 
      as for TEM or investigation of sample surface morphology and subcellular 
      composition, when samples are dried as for conventional SEM.

TI  - Development, surface exposure, and embryo behavior affect oxygen levels in eggs of 
      the red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas.
PG  - 956-66
AB  - Oxygen stress can slow development, induce hatching, and kill eggs. Terrestrial 
      anamniote embryos face a potential conflict between oxygen uptake and water loss. We 
      measured oxygen levels within eggs to characterize the respiratory environment for 
      embryos of the red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, a Neotropical frog with 
      arboreal egg masses and plastic hatching timing. Perivitelline oxygen partial 
      pressure (Po2) was extremely variable both within and among eggs. Po2 increased with 
      air-exposed surface of the egg and declined over the developmental period before 
      hatching competence. Through the plastic hatching period, however, average Po2 was 
      stable despite continued rapid development. Development was synchronous across a 
      wide range of perivitelline Po2 (0.5-16.5 kPa), and hatching-competent embryos 
      tolerated Po2 as low as 0.5 kPa without hatching. The variation in Po2 measured over 
      short periods of time within individual eggs was as great as that measured across 
      development or surface exposure, including sharp transients associated with embryo 
      movements. There was also a strong gradient of Po2 across the egg from superficial 
      to deep positions. Ciliary circulation of fluid within the egg is clearly 
      insufficient to keep it mixed. Embryos may maintain development under hypoxic 
      conditions by strategic positioning of respiratory surfaces, particularly external 
      gills, to exploit the patchy distribution of oxygen within their eggs.

AB  - Invasive Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus Kuhl, 1820) have introduced a lung 
      parasite, Raillietiella orientalis, (Hett, 1915) from the python's native range in 
      Southeast Asia to its introduced range in Florida, where parasite spillover from 
      pythons to two families and eight genera of native snakes has occurred. Because 
      these novel host species present a diversity of ecological and morphological traits, 
      and because these parasites attach to their hosts with hooks located on their 
      cephalothorax, we predicted that R. orientalis would exhibit substantial, 
      host-associated phenotypic plasticity in cephalothorax shape. Indeed, geometric 
      morphometric analyses of 39 parasites from five host species revealed significant 
      variation among host taxa in R. orientalis cephalothorax shape. We observed 
      differences associated with host ecology, where parasites from semi-aquatic and 
      aquatic snakes exhibited the greatest morphological similarity. Morphological 
      analyses of R. orientalis recovered from invasive pythons, native pit vipers, and 
      terrestrial snakes each revealed distinct shapes. Our results suggest R. orientalis 
      can exhibit significant differences in morphology based upon host species infected, 
      and this plasticity may facilitate infection with this non-native parasite in a wide 
      array of novel squamate host species.

TI  - Inducible defenses in Olympia oysters in response to an invasive predator.
PG  - 809-819
LID - 10.1007/s00442-017-3811-x [doi]
AB  - The prey naiveté hypothesis suggests that native prey may be vulnerable to 
      introduced predators because they have not evolved appropriate defenses. However, 
      recent evidence suggests that native prey sometimes exhibit induced defenses to 
      introduced predators, as a result of rapid evolution or other processes. We examined 
      whether Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) display inducible defenses in the presence 
      of an invasive predator, the Atlantic oyster drill (Urosalpinx cinerea), and whether 
      these responses vary among oyster populations from estuaries with and without this 
      predator. We spawned oysters from six populations distributed among three estuaries 
      in northern California, USA, and raised their offspring through two generations 
      under common conditions to minimize effects of environmental history. We exposed 
      second-generation oysters to cue treatments: drills eating oysters, drills eating 
      barnacles, or control seawater. Oysters from all populations grew smaller shells 
      when exposed to drill cues, and grew thicker and harder shells when those drills 
      were eating oysters. Oysters exposed to drills eating other oysters were 
      subsequently preyed upon at a slower rate. Although all oyster populations exhibited 
      inducible defenses, oysters from the estuary with the greatest exposure to drills 
      grew the smallest shells suggesting that oyster populations have evolved adaptive 
      differences in the strength of their responses to predators. Our findings add to a 
      growing body of literature that suggests that marine prey may be less likely to 
      exhibit naiveté in the face of invasive predators than prey in communities that are 
      more isolated from native predators, such as many freshwater and terrestrial island 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Urban sprawl increasingly affects the ecology of natural populations, including 
      host-microbiota interactions, with observed differences in the gut microbiota 
      between urban and rural hosts. While different mechanisms could explain this 
      pattern, dietary uptake constitutes a likely candidate. To assess the contribution 
      of diet in explaining urban-rural variation in gut microbiota, we performed an 
      aviary experiment in which urban and rural house sparrows were fed with mimics of 
      urban or rural diets. Before the experiment, rural sparrows hosted more diverse gut 
      communities, with a higher relative abundance of Enterococcaceae and 
      Staphylococcaceae and lower abundance of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation 
      and lipid metabolism than their urban counterparts. The experimental diets 
      significantly altered gut microbiota α- and β-diversity and taxonomic composition, 
      with the strongest shifts occurring in individuals exposed to contrasting diets. 
      Overall, diet-induced shifts resembled initial differences between free-ranging 
      urban and rural hosts. Furthermore, rural diet had a positive impact on urban host 
      body mass but only in hosts with the highest initial gut diversity. Overall, our 
      results indicate that diet constitutes an important factor contributing to 
      differences in gut microbiota along the urbanization gradient and provide new 
      insights on possible fitness consequences of a reduced gut diversity in urban 
      settings.

AB  - The success of insects in terrestrial environments is due in large part to their 
      ability to resist desiccation stress. Since the majority of water is lost across the 
      cuticle, a relatively water-impermeable cuticle is a major component of insect 
      desiccation resistance. Cuticular permeability is affected by the properties and 
      mixing effects of component hydrocarbons, and changes in cuticular hydrocarbons can 
      affect desiccation tolerance. A pre-exposure to a mild desiccation stress increases 
      duration of desiccation survival in adult female Drosophila melanogaster, via a 
      decrease in cuticular permeability. To test whether this acute response to 
      desiccation stress is due to a change in cuticular hydrocarbons, we treated male and 
      female D. melanogaster to a rapid desiccation hardening (RDH) treatment and used gas 
      chromatography to examine the effects on cuticular hydrocarbon composition. RDH led 
      to reduced proportions of unsaturated and methylated hydrocarbons compared to 
      controls in females, but although RDH modified the cuticular hydrocarbon profile in 
      males, there was no coordinated pattern. These data suggest that the phenomenon of 
      RDH leading to reduced cuticular water loss occurs via an acute change in cuticular 
      hydrocarbons that enhances desiccation tolerance in female, but not male, D. 
      melanogaster.

TI  - Transgenerational plasticity in the sea: context-dependent maternal effects across 
      the life history.
PG  - 418-27
AB  - Maternal effects can have dramatic influences on the phenotype of offspring. 
      Maternal effects can act as a conduit by which the maternal environment negatively 
      affects offspring fitness, but they can also buffer offspring from environmental 
      change by altering the phenotype of offspring according to local environmental 
      conditions and as such, are a form of transgenerational plasticity. The benefits of 
      maternal effects can be highly context dependent, increasing performance in one 
      life-history stage but reducing it in another. While maternal effects are 
      increasingly well understood in terrestrial systems, studies in the marine 
      environment are typically restricted to a single, early life-history stage. Here, I 
      examine the role of maternal effects across the life history of the bryozoan Bugula 
      neritina. I exposed maternal colonies to a common pollution stress (copper) in the 
      laboratory and then placed them in the field for one week to brood offspring. I then 
      examined the resistance of offspring to copper from toxicant-exposed and 
      toxicant-naïve mothers and found that offspring from toxicant-exposed mothers were 
      larger, more dispersive, and more resistant to copper stress than offspring from 
      naïve mothers. However, maternal exposure history had pervasive, negative effects on 
      the post-metamorphic performance (particularly survival) of offspring: offspring 
      from toxicant-exposed mothers had poorer performance after six weeks in the field, 
      especially when facing high levels of intraspecific competition. Maternal experience 
      can have complex effects on offspring phenotype, enhancing performance in one 
      life-history stage while decreasing performance in another. The context-dependent 
      costs and benefits associated with maternally derived pollution resistance may 
      account for why such resistance is induced rather than continually expressed: 
      mothers must balance the benefits of producing pollution-resistant larvae with the 
      costs of producing poorer performing adults (in the absence of pollution).

AB  - Promotion of nonfood species production to marginal, degraded lands abandoned by 
      mainstream agriculture is affected by extremes of water availability (droughts and 
      floods), which have increased in frequency and intensity and account for severe 
      yield reduction. Arundo donax L., known as giant cane or giant reed, spontaneously 
      grows in different kinds of environments with limitation to low temperature and is 
      thus widespread in temperate and hot areas around the world. Moreover, this 
      perennial rhizomatous grass has been recognized as a leading candidate crop in the 
      Mediterranean for lignocellulosic feedstock due to its high C(3) photosynthetic 
      capacity, positive energy balance and low agroecological management demand. In this 
      study, the photosynthetic performance and growth response of A. donax to 
      waterlogging and submergence stress following a time course as well as their 
      respective re-oxygenation were analyzed under reproducible and controlled 
      environment conditions. Results of growth response showed that biomass production 
      was strongly conditioned by the availability of oxygen. In fact, only waterlogged 
      plants showed similar growth capacity to those under control conditions, while 
      plants under submergence resulted in a dramatic reduction of this trait. The 
      simultaneous measurements of both gas exchanges and chlorophyll fluorescence 
      highlighted an alteration of both stomatal and non-stomatal photosynthetic behaviors 
      during a short/medium period of oxygen deprivation and re-oxygenation. 
      Photosynthetic CO(2) uptake was strictly related to a combination of stomatal and 
      mesophyll diffusional constrains, depending on the severity of the treatment and 
      exposure time. Conditions of waterlogging and hypoxia revealed a slight growth 
      plasticity of the species in response to prolonged stress conditions, followed by a 
      fast recovery upon reoxygenation. Moreover, the rapid restoration of physiological 
      functions after O(2) deprivation testifies to the environmental plasticity of this 
      species, although prolonged O(2) shortage proved detrimental to A. donax by 
      hampering growth and photosynthetic CO(2) uptake.

TI  - When and where to hatch? Red-eyed treefrog embryos use light cues in two contexts.
PG  - e6018
LID - 10.7717/peerj.6018 [doi]
LID - e6018
AB  - Hatching timing is under strong selection and environmentally cued in many species. 
      Embryos use multiple sensory modalities to inform hatching timing and many have 
      spontaneous hatching patterns adaptively synchronized to natural cycles. Embryos can 
      also adaptively shift their hatching timing in response to environmental cues 
      indicating immediate threats or opportunities. Such cued shifts in hatching are 
      widespread among amphibians; however, we know little about what, if anything, 
      regulates their spontaneous hatching. Moreover, in addition to selection on hatching 
      timing, embryos may experience benefits or suffer costs due to the spatial 
      orientation of hatching. Amphibian eggs generally lack internal constraints on 
      hatching direction but embryos might, nonetheless, use external cues to inform 
      hatching orientation. The terrestrial embryos of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis 
      callidryas, hatch rapidly and prematurely in response to vibrational cues in 
      egg-predator attacks and hypoxia if flooded. Here we examined A. callidryas' use of 
      light cues in hatching timing and orientation. To assess patterns of spontaneous 
      hatching and the role of light cues in their diel timing, we recorded hatching times 
      for siblings distributed across three light environments: continuous light, 
      continuous dark, and a 12L:12D photoperiod. Under a natural photoperiod, embryos 
      showed a clear diel pattern of synchronous hatching shortly after nightfall. 
      Hatching was desynchronized in both continuous light and continuous darkness. It was 
      also delayed by continuous light, but not accelerated by continuous dark, suggesting 
      the onset of dark serves as a hatching cue. We examined hatching orientation and 
      light as a potential directional cue for flooded embryos. Embryos flooded in their 
      clutches almost always hatched toward open water, whereas individual eggs flooded in 
      glass cups often failed to do so, suggesting the natural context provides a 
      directional cue. To test if flooded embryos orient hatching toward light, we placed 
      individual eggs in tubes with one end illuminated and the other dark, then flooded 
      them and recorded hatching direction. Most embryos hatched toward the light, 
      suggesting they use light as a directional cue. Our results support that A. 
      callidryas embryos use light cues to inform both when and where to hatch. Both the 
      spatial orientation of hatching and the timing of spontaneous hatching may affect 
      fitness and be informed by cues in a broader range of species than is currently 
      appreciated.

TI  - Dispersal distance is influenced by parental and grand-parental density.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2014.1061 [doi]
LID - 20141061
AB  - Non-genetic transmission of information across generations, so-called parental 
      effects, can have significant impacts on offspring morphology, physiology, behaviour 
      and life-history traits. In previous experimental work using the two-spotted spider 
      mite Tetranychus urticae Koch, we demonstrated that dispersal distances increase 
      with local density and levels of genetic relatedness. We here show that manipulation 
      of parental and grand-parental density has a significant effect on offspring 
      dispersal distance, of the same order of magnitude as manipulation of offspring 
      density. We demonstrate that offspring exposed to the same density disperse further 
      if they were born to parents exposed to higher density compared with parents exposed 
      to low density. Offspring dispersal distance also increases when grand-parents were 
      exposed to higher density, except for offspring exposed to low densities, which 
      disperse at shorter distances whatever the grand-parental density. We also show that 
      offspring from mothers exposed to higher densities were overall larger, which 
      suggests that parents in high densities invest more in individual offspring, 
      enabling them to disperse further. We propose that our findings should be included 
      in models investigating the spread rate of invasive species or when predicting the 
      success of conservation measures of species attempting to track changing climates.

PG  - e42206
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042206 [doi]
LID - e42206
AB  - Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is closely linked to different habitats and way of life. 
      In birds, some studies have noted that BMR is higher in marine species compared to 
      those inhabiting terrestrial habitats. However, the extent of such metabolic 
      dichotomy and its underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Migratory shorebirds 
      (Charadriiformes) offer a particularly interesting opportunity for testing this 
      marine-non-marine difference as they are typically divided into two broad categories 
      in terms of their habitat occupancy outside the breeding season: 'coastal' and 
      'inland' shorebirds. Here, we measured BMR for 12 species of migratory shorebirds 
      wintering in temperate inland habitats and collected additional BMR values from the 
      literature for coastal and inland shorebirds along their migratory route to make 
      inter- and intraspecific comparisons. We also measured the BMR of inland and coastal 
      dunlins Calidris alpina wintering at a similar latitude to facilitate a more direct 
      intraspecific comparison. Our interspecific analyses showed that BMR was 
      significantly lower in inland shorebirds than in coastal shorebirds after the 
      effects of potentially confounding climatic (latitude, temperature, solar radiation, 
      wind conditions) and organismal (body mass, migratory status, phylogeny) factors 
      were accounted for. This indicates that part of the variation in basal metabolism 
      might be attributed to genotypic divergence. Intraspecific comparisons showed that 
      the mass-specific BMR of dunlins wintering in inland freshwater habitats was 15% 
      lower than in coastal saline habitats, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity also 
      plays an important role in generating these metabolic differences. We propose that 
      the absence of tidally-induced food restrictions, low salinity, and less windy 
      microclimates associated with inland freshwater habitats may reduce the levels of 
      energy expenditure, and hence BMR. Further research including common-garden 
      experiments that eliminate phenotypic plasticity as a source of phenotypic variation 
      is needed to determine to what extent these general patterns are attributable to 
      genotypic adaptation.

LID - 10.1007/s10265-009-0300-2 [doi]
AB  - Diurnal phototropism has not been reported in ferns. In this study we found that the 
      four leaflets of the amphibious fern Marsilea quadrifolia are capable of adjusting 
      their leaflet angle and leaflet azimuth in response to changes in the position of 
      the sun's direct beam, exhibiting more diaphototropic movements (orienting the plane 
      of the lamina perpendicular to incident light) in the morning and late afternoon, 
      and more paraphototropic movements (orienting the plane of the lamina parallel to 
      incident light) at noon. In addition, by cutting off the leaflet lamina and covering 
      portions of leaflets with black tape, the junction between the leaflet and petiole 
      was found to be responsible for light reception. Among the light spectrum 
      investigated, blue light was the most effective at inducing diaphototropism. The 
      role of diurnal phototropism in enhancing carbon return and ameliorating 
      photoinhibition was also evaluated. It was concluded that diurnal phototropic leaf 
      movement represents one of the plastic responses enabling this amphibious fern to 
      grow under terrestrial conditions.

PG  - E172-9
LID - 10.1086/665646 [doi]
AB  - Macrophysiology is defined as the study of variation in physiological 
      traits-including physiological trait flexibility-over large geographical and 
      temporal scales, and the ecological implications of this variation. A classic 
      example of a macrophysiological trend is the one emerging from the climatic 
      variability hypothesis, which states that as the range of climatic fluctuation 
      experienced by terrestrial animals increases with latitude, individuals at higher 
      latitudes should be more plastic than individuals inhabiting lower latitudes. In 
      this context, we evaluate the correlation between absolute metabolic scope during 
      cold exposure (an instantaneous measure of metabolic flexibility) and different 
      geographic and climatic variables for 48 rodent species. Conventional and 
      phylogenetic informed analyses indicated a positive correlation between metabolic 
      scope and geographic latitude. These findings, together with previous reports on 
      latitudinal pattern in phenotypic flexibility, suggest that an increase in 
      physiological flexibility with latitude may hold for many phenotypic traits.

AB  - The biology and physical properties of the uniquely human skin cream 'vernix 
      caseosa' are discussed. This material coats the foetal skin surface during the last 
      trimester of gestation and provides multiple beneficial functions for the foetus and 
      newborn infant. Vernix has a complex structure similar to stratum corneum but lacks 
      lipid lamellae and is more plastic due to the absence of desmosomal constraints. In 
      utero, vernix is made in part by foetal sebaceous glands, interacts with pulmonary 
      surfactant, detaches into the amniotic fluid, and is swallowed by the foetus. At the 
      time of birth, vernix has a remarkably constant water content approximating 80%. 
      Postnatally, vernix is simultaneously a cleanser, a moisturizer, an anti-infective, 
      and an anti-oxidant. Vernix facilitates acid mantle development and supports normal 
      bacterial colonization. Its hydrated cellular structure and unusual lipid 
      composition provide a 'best' solution for the needs of the foetus and newborn, not 
      least of which is the attraction of caregivers. Vernix is an important natural 
      biomaterial of potential interest to cosmetic scientists, and other disciplines 
      involved in product development and therapies targeting the complex interface 
      between the stratum corneum and a changing terrestrial environment.

AB  - Organisms are either heterotrophic or autotrophic, meaning that they cover their 
      carbon requirements by assimilating organic compounds or by fixing inorganic carbon 
      dioxide (CO(2)). The conversion of a heterotrophic organism into an autotrophic one 
      by metabolic engineering is a long-standing goal in synthetic biology and 
      biotechnology, because it ultimately allows for the production of value-added 
      compounds from CO(2). The heterotrophic Alphaproteobacterium Methylobacterium 
      extorquens AM1 is a platform organism for a future C1-based bioeconomy. Here we show 
      that M. extorquens AM1 provides unique advantages for establishing synthetic 
      autotrophy, because energy metabolism and biomass formation can be effectively 
      separated from each other in the organism. We designed and realized an engineered 
      strain of M. extorquens AM1 that can use the C1 compound methanol for energy 
      acquisition and forms biomass from CO(2) by implementation of a heterologous 
      Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. We demonstrate that the heterologous CBB cycle is 
      active, confers a distinct phenotype, and strongly increases viability of the 
      engineered strain. Metabolic (13)C-tracer analysis demonstrates the functional 
      operation of the heterologous CBB cycle in M. extorquens AM1 and comparative 
      proteomics of the engineered strain show that the host cell reacts to the 
      implementation of the CBB cycle in a plastic way. While the heterologous CBB cycle 
      is not able to support full autotrophic growth of M. extorquens AM1, our study 
      represents a further advancement in the design and realization of synthetic 
      autotrophic organisms.

TI  - The corneal epithelial surface in the eyes of vertebrates: environmental and 
      evolutionary influences on structure and function.
PG  - 273-91
AB  - The smooth optical surface of the cornea is maintained by a tear film, which adheres 
      to a variety of microprojections. These microprojections increase the cell surface 
      area and are thought to improve the movement of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolic 
      products across the outer cell membranes. However, little is known of these 
      structural adaptations in vertebrates inhabiting different environments. This field 
      emission scanning electron microscopic study examined the cell density and surface 
      structure of corneal epithelial cells across 51 representative species of all 
      vertebrate classes from a large range of habitats (aquatic, amphibious, terrestrial, 
      and aerial). In particular, we wished to extend the range of vertebrates to include 
      agnathans and some uniquely Australian species, such as the Australian lungfish 
      (Neoceratodus forsteri), the Australian galah (Eolophus roseicapillus), the 
      Australian koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), and the rat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis 
      crassicaudata). Epithelial cell densities ranged from 28,860 +/- 9,214 cells mm(-2) 
      in the flathead sole Hippoglossoides elassodon (a marine teleost) to 2,126 +/- 713 
      cells mm(-2) in the Australian koala (a terrestrial mammal), which may indicate a 
      reduction in osmotic stress across the corneal surface. A similar reduction in cell 
      density occurred from marine to estuarine to freshwater species. The structure and 
      occurrence of microholes, microplicae, microridges, and microvilli are also 
      described with respect to the demands placed on the cornea in different 
      environments. All species that spend significant periods out of an aquatic 
      environment possess microvilli and/or microplicae. These include all of our species 
      of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, and even one species of Teleostei (Australian 
      lungfish). Well-developed microridges occur only in teleosts in high osmolarity 
      environments such as marine or estuarine habitats. Clear interspecific differences 
      in corneal surface structure suggest a degree of adaptive plasticity, in addition to 
      some phylogenetic trends.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the life cycle environmental implications of producing 
      fiber-reinforced biocomposite pellets, compared with sugarcane- and petroleum-based 
      polyethylene (PE) pellets. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is used to 
      evaluate the production of four types of pellets. LCA allows the evaluation of the 
      benefits of improving the production of biobased materials by replacing part of the 
      sugarcane bioPE with bagasse fibers. The functional unit selected was the production 
      of 1 kg of plastic pellets. Primary data were collected from laboratory tests 
      designed to obtain pulp fibers from bagasse and mix them with sugarcane bioPE. Two 
      processes were studied to obtain fibers from bagasse: soda fractionation and hot 
      water-soda fractionation. The results from the LCA show environmental improvements 
      when reducing the amount of bioPE by replacing it with bagasse fibers in the 
      categories of global warming, ozone formation, terrestrial acidification and fossil 
      resource scarcity, when comparing to 100% sugarcane bioPE, and a reduction in global 
      warming and fossil resource scarcity when compared to fossil-based PE. In contrast, 
      results also indicate that there could be higher impacts in terms of ozone 
      formation, freshwater eutrophication, and terrestrial acidification. Even though 
      biocomposites result as a preferred option to bioPE, several challenges need to be 
      overcome before a final recommendation is placed. The sensitivity analysis showed 
      the importance of the energy source on the impacts of the processing of fibers. 
      Thus, using clean energy to produce biobased materials may reduce the impacts 
      related to the production stage. These results are intended to increase the 
      attention of the revalorization of these residues and their application to generate 
      more advanced materials. Further outlook should also consider a deeper evaluation of 
      the impacts during the production of a plastic object and possible effects of the 
      biobased materials during final disposal.

AB  - Climate change increases average temperatures and the occurrence of extreme weather 
      events, in turn accentuating the risk of organism exposure to temperature stress. 
      When thermal conditions become stressful, the sensitivity of insects toward 
      insecticides can be exacerbated. Likewise, exposure of insects to insecticides can 
      subsequently influence their ability to handle stressful temperatures. Here, we 
      investigated the effects of constant temperature and daily heat spikes, in 
      presence/absence of insecticide treatment (cyfluthrin), on the condition (impairment 
      of mobility) and thermal tolerance to cold (-6 °C) and heat (42.5 °C) of the 
      terrestrial beetle Alphitobius diaperinus. The responses of insects from four 
      populations (three farm-collected populations, one laboratory population) to 
      different durations of extreme temperature exposure were compared. The results 
      showed that the laboratory population was generally more sensitive to extreme cold 
      and heat temperatures, with less than 50% of adults recovering after an exposure at 
      -6 or +42.5 °C for 3h. Significant differences in the level of thermal tolerance 
      were also found among insects from poultry farms. Cyfluthrin exposure incurred 
      detrimental effects to insects' condition in all but one population. For two out of 
      the four populations, mobility impairment was increased when adults were exposed to 
      daily heat spikes (6 h per day at 38 °C) and cyfluthrin simultaneously, compared to 
      cyfluthrin exposure at constant temperatures; yet, no significant interaction 
      between the two stressors was found. Finally, using one farm collected population, 
      effects of pre-exposure to cyfluthrin on extreme temperature tolerance provided 
      another example of the toxicant-induced climate sensitivity in insects.

AB  - In the Maritime Antarctic and High Arctic, soil microhabitat temperatures throughout 
      the year typically range between -10 and +5 °C. However, on occasion, they can 
      exceed 20 °C, and these instances are likely to increase and intensify as a result 
      of climate warming. Remaining active under both cool and warm conditions is 
      therefore important for polar terrestrial invertebrates if they are to forage, 
      reproduce and maximise their fitness. In the current study, lower and upper thermal 
      activity thresholds were investigated in the polar Collembola, Megaphorura arctica 
      and Cryptopygus antarcticus, and the mite, Alaskozetes antarcticus. Specifically, 
      the effect of acclimation on these traits was explored. Sub-zero activity was 
      exhibited in all three species, at temperatures as low as -4.6 °C in A. antarcticus. 
      At high temperatures, all three species had capacity for activity above 30 °C and 
      were most active at 25 °C. This indicates a comparable spread of temperatures across 
      which activity can occur to that seen in temperate and tropical species, but with 
      the activity window shifted towards lower temperatures. In all three species 
      following one month acclimation at -2 °C, chill coma (=the temperature at which 
      movement and activity cease) and the critical thermal minimum (=low temperature at 
      which coordination is no longer shown) occurred at lower temperatures than for 
      individuals maintained at +4 °C (except for the CTmin of M. arctica). Individuals 
      acclimated at +9 °C conversely showed little change in their chill coma or CTmin. A 
      similar trend was demonstrated for the heat coma and critical thermal maximum 
      (CTmax) of all species. Following one month at -2 °C, the heat coma and CTmax were 
      reduced as compared with +4 °C reared individuals, whereas the heat coma and CTmax 
      of individuals acclimated at +9 °C showed little adjustment. The data obtained 
      suggest these invertebrates are able to take maximum advantage of the short growing 
      season and have some capacity, in spite of limited plasticity at high temperatures, 
      to cope with climate change.

TI  - Hierarchical plant responses and diversity loss after nitrogen addition: testing 
      three functionally-based hypotheses in the Inner Mongolia grassland.
PG  - e20078
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0020078 [doi]
LID - e20078
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have shown that nitrogen (N) deposition decreases 
      biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. To explain the N-induced species loss, three 
      functionally based hypotheses have been proposed: the aboveground competition 
      hypothesis, the belowground competition hypothesis, and the total competition 
      hypothesis. However, none of them is supported sufficiently by field experiments. A 
      main challenge to testing these hypotheses is to ascertain the role of shoot and 
      root competition in controlling plant responses to N enrichment. Simultaneously 
      examining both aboveground and belowground responses in natural ecosystems is 
      logistically complex, and has rarely been done. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a 
      two-year N addition experiment conducted in a natural grassland ecosystem, we 
      investigated both above- and belowground responses of plants at the individual, 
      species, and community levels. Plants differed significantly in their responses to N 
      addition across the different organizational levels. The community-level species 
      loss was mainly due to the loss of perennial grasses and forbs, while the relative 
      abundance of plant species was dependent mainly on individual-level responses. 
      Plasticity in biomass allocation was much smaller within a species than between 
      species, providing a biological basis for explaining the functionally based species 
      loss. All species increased biomass allocation to aboveground parts, but species 
      with high belowground allocations were replaced by those with high aboveground 
      allocations, indicating that the increased aboveground competition was the key 
      process responsible for the observed diversity loss after N addition in this 
      grassland ecosystem. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings shed new light on the 
      validity of the three competing hypotheses concerning species loss in response to N 
      enrichment. They also have important implications for predicting the future impacts 
      of N deposition on the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In 
      addition, we have developed a new technique for ascertaining the roles of 
      aboveground and belowground competition in determining plant responses to N 
      fertilization.

TI  - The ontogeny of talo-crural appositional articular morphology among catarrhine taxa: 
      adult shape reflects substrate use.
PG  - 447-58
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.22528 [doi]
AB  - The upper ankle joint forms a single articular plane between organism and the foot 
      and substrate. Singular warp analysis shows that its shape reflects substrate use. 
      This study explores whether the differences in shape are genetic with a 
      developmental trajectory evident during ontogeny or epigenetic and the result of 
      substrate use by the individual. A total of 418 matched distal tibial and proximal 
      talar landmarked surfaces from adult and subadult specimens from 12 diverse 
      catarrhine taxa were studied. Specimens were grouped by molar eruption (M1, M2, and 
      M3) for comparative analysis. Generalized Procrustes analysis, multivariate 
      regression, relative warp analysis, singular warp analysis, and permutation tests 
      were used. Singular warp analysis for the entire cohort was highly significant in 
      the first singular warp, with the adult taxa sorting by substrate use. All 173 
      subadults clustered with an adult "arboreal" shape profile. Among Hominoidea, adults 
      (M3) sorted by substrate use with Pan paniscus and Hylobatidae assuming an 
      "arboreal" shape separate from Pan troglodytes and the remaining taxa with 
      "terrestrial" shape. Cercopithecoid adults sorted by substrate use as well, with the 
      M3 specimens of Papio hamadryas and Macaca thibetana demonstrating a "terrestrial" 
      shape. Differences in mode of locomotion did not affect the findings in the first 
      singular warp. Results confirmed the convergence of talo-crural shape among 
      superfamilies based on substrate use and divergence in shape within Pan and Macaca, 
      based on substrate use. The shape differences among adults (M3) are consistent with 
      a plastic response to the behavioral stimulus of substrate use.

TI  - Organotin Exposure and Vertebrate Reproduction: A Review.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2018.00064 [doi]
LID - 64
AB  - Organotin (OTs) compounds are organometallic compounds that are widely used in 
      industry, such as in the manufacture of plastics, pesticides, paints, and others. 
      OTs are released into the environment by anthropogenic actions, leading to contact 
      with aquatic and terrestrial organisms that occur in animal feeding. Although OTs 
      are degraded environmentally, reports have shown the effects of this contamination 
      over the years because it can affect organisms of different trophic levels. OTs act 
      as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which can lead to several abnormalities in 
      organisms. In male animals, OTs decrease the weights of the testis and epididymis 
      and reduce the spermatid count, among other dysfunctions. In female animals, OTs 
      alter the weights of the ovaries and uteri and induce damage to the ovaries. In 
      addition, OTs prevent fetal implantation and reduce mammalian pregnancy rates. OTs 
      cross the placental barrier and accumulate in the placental and fetal tissues. 
      Exposure to OTs in utero leads to the accumulation of lipid droplets in the Sertoli 
      cells and gonocytes of male offspring in addition to inducing early puberty in 
      females. In both genders, this damage is associated with the imbalance of sex 
      hormones and the modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Here, we 
      report that OTs act as reproductive disruptors in vertebrate studies; among the 
      compounds are tetrabutyltin, tributyltin chloride, tributyltin acetate, triphenyltin 
      chloride, triphenyltin hydroxide, dibutyltin chloride, dibutyltin dichloride, 
      diphenyltin dichloride, monobutyltin, and azocyclotin.

TI  - Stability of dendritic mass during aestivation.
PG  - 150-8
AB  - In hot and dry weather, terrestrial snails withdraw into their shells and remain 
      inactive for long periods of time. This phenomenon, known as aestivation, is the 
      basis for our investigation of the effects of behavioral inactivity on neuronal 
      structure. Several recent studies have shown that the level of afferent electrical 
      activity is an important modifier of structure, even in adult animals. During 
      aestivation, sensory stimulation (and therefore presumably afferent activity) is 
      greatly reduced. We have tested the hypothesis that long-term behavioral inactivity 
      causes a regression of dendrites. Two identified neurons of Achatina fulica were 
      selected for study, the giant cerebral neuron (GCN) and RPall. The cells were viewed 
      on 10-micron-thick sections after intracellular injection of hexamminecobalt 
      chloride. They were reconstructed by using a video camera attached to a light 
      microscope and a digitizing board resident in a microcomputer. Snails in the 
      aestivated group were completely inactive for 8 weeks beginning at age 23 weeks. A 
      quantitative analysis showed that there were no significant differences in either 
      cell, in either the total mass of material or its distribution, comparing cells from 
      the Aestivated snails and cells from the Younger snails (age 23 weeks) and the Older 
      snails (age 33 weeks). These results suggest limits to the modifiability of neuronal 
      structure.

TI  - Transient "deafness" accompanies auditory development during metamorphosis from 
      tadpole to frog.
PG  - 14877-82
AB  - During metamorphosis, ranid frogs shift from a purely aquatic to a partly 
      terrestrial lifestyle. The central auditory system undergoes functional and 
      neuroanatomical reorganization in parallel with the development of new sound 
      conduction pathways adapted for the detection of airborne sounds. Neural responses 
      to sounds can be recorded from the auditory midbrain of tadpoles shortly after 
      hatching, with higher rates of synchronous neural activity and lower sharpness of 
      tuning than observed in postmetamorphic animals. Shortly before the onset of 
      metamorphic climax, there is a brief "deaf" period during which no auditory activity 
      can be evoked from the midbrain, and a loss of connectivity is observed between 
      medullary and midbrain auditory nuclei. During the final stages of metamorphic 
      development, auditory function and neural connectivity are restored. The acoustic 
      communication system of the adult frog emerges from these periods of anatomical and 
      physiological plasticity during metamorphosis.

      Investigation about PAEs in terrestrial ecosystem has been extensively conducted 
      while the fate of PAEs in marine environment remains underexplored. In this study, a 
      novel di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) degrading marine bacterial strain, 
      Mycolicibacterium phocaicum RL-HY01, was isolated and characterized from intertidal 
      sediments. Strain RL-HY01 could utilize a range of PAE plasticizers as sole carbon 
      source for growth. The effects of different environmental factors on the degradation 
      of PAEs were evaluated and the results indicated that strain RL-HY01 could 
      efficiently degrade PAEs under a wide range of pH (5.0 to 9.0), temperature (20 °C 
      to 40 °C) and salinity (below 10%). Specifically, when Tween-80 was added as 
      solubilizing agent, strain RL-HY01 could rapidly degrade DEHP and achieve complete 
      degradation of DEHP (50 mg/L) in 48 h. The kinetics of DEHP degradation by RL-HY01 
      were well fitted with the modified Gompertz model. The metabolic intermediates of 
      DEHP by strain RL-HY01 were identified by ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis and then the 
      metabolic pathway of DEHP was deduced. DEHP was transformed into di-ethyl phthalate 
      (DEP) via β-oxidation and then DEP was hydrolyzed into phthalic acid (PA) by 
      de-esterification. PA was further transformed into gentisate via salicylic acid and 
      further utilized for cell growth. Bioaugmentation of strain RL-HY01 with marine 
      samples was performed to evaluate its application potential and the results 
      suggested that strain RL-HY01 could accelerate the elimination of DEHP in marine 
      samples. The results have advanced our understanding of the fate of PAEs in marine 
      ecosystem and identified an efficient bioremediation strategy for PAEs-polluted 
      marine sites.

AB  - The maximum photosynthetic carboxylation rate (V(cmax) ) is an influential plant 
      trait that has multiple scaling hypotheses, which is a source of uncertainty in 
      predictive understanding of global gross primary production (GPP). Four 
      trait-scaling hypotheses (plant functional type, nutrient limitation, environmental 
      filtering, and plant plasticity) with nine specific implementations were used to 
      predict global V(cmax) distributions and their impact on global GPP in the Sheffield 
      Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM). Global GPP varied from 108.1 to 
      128.2 PgC yr(-1) , 65% of the range of a recent model intercomparison of global GPP. 
      The variation in GPP propagated through to a 27% coefficient of variation in net 
      biome productivity (NBP). All hypotheses produced global GPP that was highly 
      correlated (r = 0.85-0.91) with three proxies of global GPP. Plant functional 
      type-based nutrient limitation, underpinned by a core SDGVM hypothesis that plant 
      nitrogen (N) status is inversely related to increasing costs of N acquisition with 
      increasing soil carbon, adequately reproduced global GPP distributions. Further 
      improvement could be achieved with accurate representation of water sensitivity and 
      agriculture in SDGVM. Mismatch between environmental filtering (the most data-driven 
      hypothesis) and GPP suggested that greater effort is needed understand V(cmax) 
      variation in the field, particularly in northern latitudes.

AB  - Plastic pollution has become one of the most emergent issues threating aquatic and 
      terrestrial ecosystems. However, it is still challenging to rapidly detect small 
      microplastics. Here, we present a method to rapidly detect microplastics using 
      hyperspectral imaging in which we optimized a commercially available hyperspectral 
      imaging system (Pika NIR-640, Resonon Inc., USA). The optimizations included: (1) 
      changing the four-lamp assembly to a symmetrical set of converged-light 
      near-infrared lamps that are placed sideways instead of above the sample stage; (2) 
      adopting a macro-photography technique by applying an extension tube between the 
      camera and the lens, and moving the lens of the hyperspectral camera to the imaging 
      target (working distance of ~3 cm); (3) adjusting the exposure and aspect ratio by 
      tuning the frame rate and scan speed of the imaging system. After optimization, the 
      detection resolution of each pixel improved from 250 µm to 14.8 µm. With the 
      optimized system, microplastics down to 100 µm in size were rapidly detected. This 
      result is promising for the application of our new method in the accelerated 
      detection of microplastics and will contribute to a better understanding of the 
      microplastic pollution situation.

AB  - Despite growing concerns regarding plastic additives, their environmental fate 
      coupled with leaching from source materials are not well known. Styrene oligomers 
      (SOs), which are unintended additives in expanded polystyrene (EPS), are estrogenic 
      micropollutants. Here, we identified the effects of their potential sources (i.e., 
      EPS buoy and its leachate) and environmental dilution on SO distribution within 
      coastal sediments. SO content in fresh EPS particles was 0.1% (w/w), dominated by 
      2,4,6-triphenyl-hexene (ST-1), while 2,4-diphenyl-1-butene (SD-2) accounted for most 
      of the SOs in EPS leachate, indicating its faster leachability. In lake and offshore 
      environments, the SO composition profiles from their terrestrial inputs and inner 
      sites were similar to those of EPS leachate; meanwhile, the exponentially decreasing 
      SO concentration and increasing styrene trimers (STs) fraction with distance from 
      the inner to outer sites were evident. These profiles indicated continuous SO 
      leaching from their potential sources in the inland, followed by a change in SOs due 
      to environmental dilution. SOs in beach sediment implied the presence of micro-sized 
      EPS particles. We suggest the ST-1 to SD-2 ratio as an index to differentiate among 
      freshly leached SOs (∼0.02), environmentally diluted SOs after leaching (∼0.1), SOs 
      in fresh EPS (∼1.2), and SOs in aged EPS (> 2).

AB  - Water availability is a major environmental challenge to a variety of terrestrial 
      organisms. In insects, desiccation tolerance varies predictably over spatial and 
      temporal scales and is an important physiological determinant of fitness in natural 
      populations. Here, we examine the dynamics of desiccation tolerance in North 
      American populations of Drosophila melanogaster using: (a) natural populations 
      sampled across latitudes and seasons; (b) experimental evolution in field mesocosms 
      over seasonal time; (c) genome-wide associations to identify SNPs/genes associated 
      with variation for desiccation tolerance; and (d) subsequent analysis of patterns of 
      clinal/seasonal enrichment in existing pooled sequencing data of populations sampled 
      in both North America and Australia. A cline in desiccation tolerance was observed, 
      for which tolerance exhibited a positive association with latitude; tolerance also 
      varied predictably with culture temperature, demonstrating a significant degree of 
      thermal plasticity. Desiccation tolerance evolved rapidly in field mesocosms, 
      although only males showed differences in desiccation tolerance between spring and 
      autumn collections from natural populations. Water loss rates did not vary 
      significantly among latitudinal or seasonal populations; however, changes in 
      metabolic rates during prolonged exposure to dry conditions are consistent with 
      increased tolerance in higher latitude populations. Genome-wide associations in a 
      panel of inbred lines identified twenty-five SNPs in twenty-one loci associated with 
      sex-averaged desiccation tolerance, but there is no robust signal of spatially 
      varying selection on genes associated with desiccation tolerance. Together, our 
      results suggest that desiccation tolerance is a complex and important fitness 
      component that evolves rapidly and predictably in natural populations.

TI  - Epigenetic population differentiation in field- and common garden-grown Scabiosa

AB  - Populations often differ in phenotype and these differences can be caused by 
      adaptation by natural selection, random neutral processes, and environmental 
      responses. The most straightforward way to divide mechanisms that influence 
      phenotypic variation is heritable variation and environmental-induced variation 
      (e.g., plasticity). While genetic variation is responsible for most heritable 
      phenotypic variation, part of this is also caused by nongenetic inheritance. 
      Epigenetic processes may be one of the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and 
      nongenetic inheritance and can therefore possibly contribute to heritable 
      differences through drift and selection. Epigenetic variation may be influenced 
      directly by the environment, and part of this variation can be transmitted to next 
      generations. Field screenings combined with common garden experiments will add 
      valuable insights into epigenetic differentiation, epigenetic memory and can help to 
      reveal part of the relative importance of epigenetics in explaining trait variation. 
      We explored both genetic and epigenetic diversity, structure and differentiation in 
      the field and a common garden for five British and five French Scabiosa columbaria 
      populations. Genetic and epigenetic variation was subsequently correlated with trait 
      variation. Populations showed significant epigenetic differentiation between 
      populations and countries in the field, but also when grown in a common garden. By 
      comparing the epigenetic variation between field and common garden-grown plants, we 
      showed that a considerable part of the epigenetic memory differed from the 
      field-grown plants and was presumably environmentally induced. The memory component 
      can consist of heritable variation in methylation that is not sensitive to 
      environments and possibly genetically based, or environmentally induced variation 
      that is heritable, or a combination of both. Additionally, random epimutations might 
      be responsible for some differences as well. By comparing epigenetic variation in 
      both the field and common environment, our study provides useful insight into the 
      environmental and genetic components of epigenetic variation.

AB  - Environmentally cued hatching is well documented in anurans, enabling embryos to 
      escape diverse threats. However, knowledge of anuran hatching mechanisms is limited 
      and based largely on aquatic-breeding species without known plasticity in hatching 
      timing. Generally, hatching gland cells produce a hatching enzyme that degrades the 
      vitelline membrane. We investigated hatching and its regulation in terrestrial 
      embryos of hourglass treefrogs, Dendropsophus ebraccatus, which accelerate hatching 
      to escape dehydration. We specifically tested if changes in hatching gland cell 
      development or hatching enzyme gene expression are associated with accelerated 
      hatching. We measured perivitelline chamber size of well-hydrated eggs over 
      development as an indicator of breakdown of the vitelline membrane and found that 
      the size of the perivitelline chamber increased steadily until hatching, suggesting 
      gradual hatching enzyme release and vitelline membrane degradation. Hatching gland 
      cells peaked in abundance and began regression substantially prior to hatching, but 
      we found no developmental differences in the abundance or surface area of hatching 
      gland cells between dry and well-hydrated embryos. Hatching enzyme gene expression 
      also peaked early in development then declined, with no difference between hydration 
      treatments. In D. ebraccatus breakdown of the vitelline membrane appears gradual, 
      mediated by hatching enzyme release starting long before hatching. However, hatching 
      acceleration is not associated with ontogenetic changes in hatching gland cell 
      development or hatching enzyme gene expression. This hatching process contrasts with 
      that of red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, which appear to release enzyme 
      acutely at hatching, yet both species are capable of hatching to escape acute 
      threats.

AB  - Monitoring data on organic pollutants published between the late 1960s and 2020 are 
      reviewed to provide comprehensive and updated insights into their bioaccumulation 
      characteristics, sources, and fate in snakes. Multiple organic pollutant classes 
      including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated paraffins, 
      dioxin-related compounds, alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, flame 
      retardants, plasticizers, etc., were detected in various aquatic and terrestrial 
      snake species with concentrations and patterns varying between species and 
      locations. In general, higher concentrations of organic pollutants were found in 
      snakes collected from contaminated sites (e.g., densely populated, 
      pesticide-treated, and waste processing areas), suggesting that snakes can serve as 
      good biomonitors of environmental pollution caused by organic contaminants. Factors 
      influencing concentrations and patterns of organic pollutants in snakes are 
      discussed, providing an overview of current understanding about their accumulation, 
      transformation, and elimination processes. Potential negative effects associated 
      with organic pollutants in snakes and their predators are also considered. Based on 
      such discussions, research gaps and future perspectives on the utilization of snake 
      biomonitoring studies are addressed, heading towards an effective monitoring and 
      assessment scheme for a variety of legacy and emerging organic pollutants in the 
      environment.

AB  - Thanks to a recent spate of sequencing projects, the Hemiptera are the first 
      hemimetabolous insect order to achieve a critical mass of species with sequenced 
      genomes, establishing the basis for comparative genomics of the bugs. However, as 
      the most speciose hemimetabolous order, there is still a vast swathe of the 
      hemipteran phylogeny that awaits genomic representation across subterranean, 
      terrestrial, and aquatic habitats, and with lineage-specific and developmentally 
      plastic cases of both wing polyphenisms and flightlessness. In this review, we 
      highlight opportunities for taxonomic sampling beyond obvious pest species 
      candidates, motivated by intriguing biological features of certain groups as well as 
      the rich research tradition of ecological, physiological, developmental, and 
      particularly cytogenetic investigation that spans the diversity of the Hemiptera.

      and evolution.
PG  - 1304-12
LID - 10.1128/EC.00155-12 [doi]
AB  - The eukaryotic microbes known as oomycetes are common inhabitants of terrestrial and 
      aquatic environments and include saprophytes and pathogens. Lifestyles of the 
      pathogens extend from biotrophy to necrotrophy, obligate to facultative 
      pathogenesis, and narrow to broad host ranges on plants or animals. Sequencing of 
      several pathogens has revealed striking variation in genome size and content, a 
      plastic set of genes related to pathogenesis, and adaptations associated with 
      obligate biotrophy. Features of genome evolution include repeat-driven expansions, 
      deletions, gene fusions, and horizontal gene transfer in a landscape organized into 
      gene-dense and gene-sparse sectors and influenced by transposable elements. Gene 
      expression profiles are also highly dynamic throughout oomycete life cycles, with 
      transcriptional polymorphisms as well as differences in protein sequence 
      contributing to variation. The genome projects have set the foundation for 
      functional studies and should spur the sequencing of additional species, including 
      more diverse pathogens and nonpathogens.

TI  - A classification schema for the vomeronasal organ in humans.
PG  - 1284-8
AB  - The vomeronasal organ is a chemoreceptive structure located at the base of the nasal 
      septum with direct axonal connections to the accessory olfactory bulb in many 
      terrestrial vertebrates. Pheromones presumably bind to the vomeronasal organ and 
      exert behavioral or physiologic responses, thereby allowing chemical communication 
      between animals of the same species. The presence and function of the vomeronasal 
      organ in humans is debated. A phenotypic classification schema for the human 
      vomeronasal organ is described and applied to 253 human subjects who underwent nasal 
      examination. Of these subjects, only 6 percent possessed a vomeronasal organ with 64 
      percent unilateral and 36 percent bilateral in appearance. No difference existed in 
      gender, age, or race between those subjects with or without a vomeronasal organ. 
      There is no evidence supporting involutional senescence of this structure. Future 
      investigations should use this phenotypic schema for the vomeronasal organ to allow 
      accurate comparisons of study populations.

AB  - Climate change is altering high-latitude ecosystems in multiple facets, including 
      increased insect herbivory pressure and enhanced emissions of volatile organic 
      compounds (VOC) from vegetation. Yet, joint impacts of climatic drivers and insect 
      herbivory on VOC emissions from the Arctic remain largely unknown. We examined how 
      one-month warming by open-top plastic tents, yielding a 3-4 °C air temperature 
      increase, and the natural presence of gall-forming eriophyoid mites, Aculus 
      tetanothrix, individually and in combination, affect VOC emissions from whortle 
      leaved willow, Salix myrsinites, at two elevations in an Arctic heath tundra of 
      Abisko, Northern Sweden. We measured VOC emissions three times in the peak growing 
      season (July) from intact and gall-infested branches using an enclosure technique 
      and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and leaf chemical composition using 
      near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Isoprene accounted for 91% of the 
      VOCs emitted by S. myrsinites. Isoprene emission rates tended to be higher at the 
      high than low elevation during the measurement periods (42 μg g(-1) DW h(-1) vs. 23 
      μg g(-1) DW h(-1)) even when temperature differences were accounted for. 
      Experimental warming increased isoprene emissions by approximately 54%, but 
      decreased emissions of some minor compound groups, such as green leaf volatiles 
      (GLV) and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). In contrast, gall-infestation 
      did not affect isoprene emissions but stimulated emissions of DMNT, sesquiterpenes 
      and GLVs, particularly under ambient conditions at the low elevation. The NIRS-based 
      chemical composition of the leaves varied between the two elevations and was 
      affected by warming and gall-infestation. Our study suggests that under elevated 
      temperatures, S. myrsinites increases emissions of isoprene, a highly effective 
      compound for protection against oxidative stress, while an infestation by A. 
      tetanothrix mites induces emissions of herbivore enemy attractants like DMNT, 
      sesquiterpenes and GLVs. Under both conditions, warming effects on isoprene remain 
      but mite effects on DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs diminish.

LID - 20161406
AB  - Ants are important components of most terrestrial habitats, and a better knowledge 
      of the diversity of their life histories is essential to understand many aspects of 
      ecosystem functioning. The myrmicine genus Cardiocondyla shows a wide range of 
      colony structures, reproductive behaviours, queen and male lifespans, and habitat 
      use. Reconstructing the evolutionary pathways of individual and social phenotypic 
      traits suggests that the ancestral life history of Cardiocondyla was characterized 
      by the presence of multiple, short-lived queens in small-sized colonies and a male 
      polyphenism with winged dispersers and wingless fighters, which engage in lethal 
      combat over female sexuals within their natal nests. Single queening, queen 
      polyphenism, the loss of winged males and tolerance among wingless males appear to 
      be derived traits that evolved with changes in nesting habits, colony size and the 
      spread from tropical to seasonal environments. The aim of this review is to bring 
      together the information on life-history evolution in Cardiocondyla and to highlight 
      the suitability of this genus for functional genomic studies of adaptation, 
      phenotypic plasticity, senescence, invasiveness and other key life-history traits of 
      ants.

TI  - Epigenetic variation in asexually reproducing organisms.
PG  - 644-55
LID - 10.1111/evo.12320 [doi]
AB  - The role that epigenetic inheritance can play in adaptation may differ between 
      sexuals and asexuals because (1) the dynamics of adaptation differ under sexual and 
      asexual reproduction and the opportunities offered by epigenetic inheritance may 
      affect these dynamics differently; and (2) in asexual reproduction epigenetic 
      reprogramming mechanisms that are associated with meiosis can be bypassed, which 
      could promote the buildup of epigenetic variation in asexuals. Here, we evaluate 
      current evidence for an epigenetic contribution to adaptation in asexuals. We argue 
      that two aspects of epigenetic variation should have particular relevance for 
      asexuals, namely epigenetics-mediated phenotypic plasticity within and between 
      generations, and heritable variation via stochastic epimutations. An evaluation of 
      epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms suggests that some, but not all, forms of 
      asexual reproduction enhance the likelihood of stable transmission of epigenetic 
      marks across generations compared to sexual reproduction. However, direct tests of 
      these predicted sexual-asexual differences are virtually lacking. Stable 
      transmission of DNA methylation, transcriptomes, and phenotypes from parent to 
      clonal offspring are demonstrated in various asexual species, and clonal genotypes 
      from natural populations show habitat-specific DNA methylation. We discuss how these 
      initial observations can be extended to demonstrate an epigenetic contribution to 
      adaptation.

TI  - Ancient DNA provides new insights into the evolutionary history of New Zealand's 
      extinct giant eagle.
PG  - e9
LID - e9
AB  - Prior to human settlement 700 years ago New Zealand had no terrestrial 
      mammals--apart from three species of bats--instead, approximately 250 avian species 
      dominated the ecosystem. At the top of the food chain was the extinct Haast's eagle, 
      Harpagornis moorei. H. moorei (10-15 kg; 2-3 m wingspan) was 30%-40% heavier than 
      the largest extant eagle (the harpy eagle, Harpia harpyja), and hunted moa up to 15 
      times its weight. In a dramatic example of morphological plasticity and rapid size 
      increase, we show that the H. moorei was very closely related to one of the world's 
      smallest extant eagles, which is one-tenth its mass. This spectacular evolutionary 
      change illustrates the potential speed of size alteration within lineages of 
      vertebrates, especially in island ecosystems.

TI  - Leaf litter decomposition of native and introduced tree species of contrasting 
      quality in headwater streams: how does the regional setting matter?

LID - S0048-9697(13)00425-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.04.004 [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial plant litter is important in sustaining stream food webs in forested 
      headwaters. Leaf litter quality often decreases when native species are replaced by 
      introduced species, and a lower quality of leaf litter inputs may alter litter 
      decomposition at sites afforested with non-native species. However, since 
      detritivore composition and resource use plasticity may depend on the prevalent 
      litter inputs, the extent of the alteration in decomposition can vary between 
      streams. We tested 2 hypotheses using 2 native and 3 introduced species of tree 
      differing in quality in 4 Iberian regions with contrasting vegetational traits: 1) 
      decomposition rates of all plant species would be higher in regions where streams 
      normally receive litter inputs of lower rather than higher quality; 2) a higher 
      resource-use plasticity of detritivores in regions vegetated with plants of lower 
      litter quality will cause a greater evenness in decomposition rates among plant 
      species compared to regions where streams normally receive higher-quality plant 
      litter inputs. Results showed a highly consistent interspecific ranking of 
      decomposition rates across regions driven by litter quality, and a significant 
      regional effect. Hypothesis 1 was supported: decomposition rates of the five litter 
      types were generally higher in streams from regions vegetated with species producing 
      leaf litter of low quality, possibly due to the profusion of caddisfly shredders in 
      their communities. Hypothesis 2 was not supported: the relative differences in 
      decomposition rates among leaf litter species remained essentially unaltered across 
      regions. Our results suggest that, even in regions where detritivores can be 
      comparatively efficient using resources of low quality, caution is needed 
      particularly when afforestation programs introduce plant species of lower litter 
      quality than the native species.

AB  - Colonization of the land by multicellular green plants was a fundamental step in the 
      evolution of life on earth. Land plants evolved from fresh-water aquatic algae, and 
      the transition to a terrestrial environment required the acquisition of 
      developmental plasticity appropriate to the conditions of water availability, 
      ranging from drought to flood. Here we show that extant bryophytes exhibit 
      submergence-induced developmental plasticity, suggesting that submergence responses 
      evolved relatively early in the evolution of land plants. We also show that a major 
      component of the bryophyte submergence response is controlled by the phytohormone 
      ethylene, using a perception mechanism that has subsequently been conserved 
      throughout the evolution of land plants. Thus a plant environmental response 
      mechanism with major ecological and agricultural importance probably had its origins 
      in the very earliest stages of the colonization of the land.

AB  - The effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on aquatic wildlife are 
      increasingly being recognized for their complexity. Investigators have detected 
      alterations at multiple levels of biological organization in offspring exposed to 
      EDCs through the blood or germ line of the parents, suggesting that generational 
      consequences of EDCs are evident. Exposure to EDCs through the parents is concerning 
      because if the resulting phenotype of the offspring is heritable and affects 
      fitness, then evolutionary consequences may be evident. This review summarizes the 
      evidence for transgenerational effects of EDCs in aquatic wildlife and illustrates 
      cases where alterations appear to be transmitted maternally, paternally, or 
      parentally. The literature indicates that EDC exposure to the parents induces 
      developmental, physiological, endocrinological, and behavioral changes as well as 
      increased mortality of offspring raised in clean environments. What is lacking, 
      however, is a clear demonstration of heritable transgenerational effects in aquatic 
      wildlife. Therefore, it is not known if the parental effects are the result of 
      developmental or phenotypic plasticity or if the altered phenotypes are durably 
      passed to subsequent generations. Epigenetic changes to gene regulation are 
      discussed as a possible mechanism responsible for EDC induced parental effects. 
      Additional research is needed to evaluate if heritable effects of EDCs are evident 
      in aquatic wildlife, as has been demonstrated for terrestrial mammals.

PG  - 489-502
LID - 10.1007/s11103-008-9438-x [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial plants have evolved remarkable morphological plasticity that enables 
      them to adapt to their surroundings. One of the most important traits that plants 
      have acquired is the ability to sense environmental cues and use them as a basis for 
      governing their growth orientation. The directional growth of plant organs relative 
      to the direction of environmental stimuli is a tropism. The Cholodny-Went theory 
      proposes that auxin plays a key role in several tropisms. Recent molecular genetic 
      studies have strongly supported this hypothesis for gravitropism. However, the 
      molecular mechanisms of other tropisms are far less clear. Hydrotropism is the 
      response of roots to a moisture gradient. Since its re-discovery in 1985, root 
      hydrotropism has been shown to be common among higher plant species. Additionally, 
      in some species, gravitropism interferes with hydrotropism, suggesting that both 
      shared and divergent mechanisms mediating the two tropisms exist. This hypothesis 
      has been supported by recent studies, which provide an understanding of how roots 
      sense multiple environmental cues and exhibit different tropic responses. In this 
      review, we focus on the overlapping and unique mechanisms of the hormonal regulation 
      underlying gravitropism and hydrotropism in roots.

TI  - Benefits of flooding-induced aquatic adventitious roots depend on the duration of 
      submergence: linking plant performance to root functioning.
PG  - 171-180
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcx049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Temporal flooding is a common environmental stress for 
      terrestrial plants. Aquatic adventitious roots (aquatic roots) are commonly formed 
      in flooding-tolerant plant species and are generally assumed to be beneficial for 
      plant growth by supporting water and nutrient uptake during partial flooding. 
      However, the actual contribution of these roots to plant performance under flooding 
      has hardly been quantified. As the investment into aquatic root development in terms 
      of carbohydrates may be costly, these costs may - depending on the specific 
      environmental conditions - offset the beneficial effects of aquatic roots. This 
      study tested the hypothesis that the balance between potential costs and benefits 
      depends on the duration of flooding, as the benefits are expected to outweigh the 
      costs in long-term but not in short-term flooding. METHODS: The contribution of 
      aquatic roots to plant performance was tested in Solanum dulcamara during 1-4 weeks 
      of partial submergence and by experimentally manipulating root production. Nutrient 
      uptake by aquatic roots, transpiration and photosynthesis were measured in plants 
      differing in aquatic root development to assess the specific function of these 
      roots. KEY RESULTS: As predicted, flooded plants benefited from the presence of 
      aquatic roots. The results showed that this was probably due to the contribution of 
      roots to resource uptake. However, these beneficial effects were only present in 
      long-term but not in short-term flooding. This relationship could be explained by 
      the correlation between nutrient uptake and the flooding duration-dependent size of 
      the aquatic root system. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that aquatic root 
      formation is likely to be selected for in habitats characterized by long-term 
      flooding. This study also revealed only limited costs associated with adventitious 
      root formation, which may explain the maintenance of the ability to produce aquatic 
      roots in habitats characterized by very rare or short flooding events.

TI  - beta-Glucocerebrosidase activity in the stratum corneum of house sparrows following 
      acclimation to high and low humidity.
PG  - 97-105
AB  - Skin is an important avenue of water loss in terrestrial birds, so environmental 
      conditions that necessitate water conservation should favor physiological mechanisms 
      that reduce cutaneous water loss (CWL). Skin resistance to CWL is conferred by a 
      barrier of lipid molecules located in the stratum corneum (SC), the outer layer of 
      the epidermis. In mammals, SC barrier function depends on the conversion of 
      cerebrosides to ceramides by the enzyme beta -glucocerebrosidase ( beta 
      -GlcCer'ase). Avian SC contains both cerebrosides and ceramides, suggesting that 
      observed plasticity in CWL may be mediated by changes in beta -GlcCer'ase activity 
      and resultant SC lipid composition. We tested the hypothesis that changes in ambient 
      humidity would alter beta -GlcCer'ase activity by acclimating house sparrows (Passer 
      domesticus) to either dry (6.5 g H(2)O m(-3) absolute humidity) or humid (31 g H(2)O 
      m(-3)) conditions for 5 and 21 d at 30 degrees C and then measuring beta -GlcCer'ase 
      activity from SC homogenates. Our results provide the first characterization of beta 
      -GlcCer'ase activity in any nonmammalian vertebrate. Relative to nonacclimated 
      controls, both dry- and humid-acclimated sparrows had significantly elevated beta 
      -GlcCer'ase activity at 21 d postacclimation. Across individuals, we observed 
      negative correlations between beta -GlcCer'ase activity and both CWL and SC ceramide 
      content. Although dry- and humid-acclimated sparrows did not differ in beta 
      -GlcCer'ase activity, these results are consistent with our findings that both 
      humidity treatments caused a reduction in CWL and similar changes in SC lipid 
      composition. Our results demonstrate physiological plasticity in CWL and provide 
      tentative support for a role of beta -GlcCer'ase in mediating this response.

      bacterial community composition and function.

LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.13824 [doi]
AB  - Preferential food selection in protists is well documented, but we still lack basic 
      understanding on how protist predation modifies the taxonomic and functional 
      composition of bacterial communities. We conducted feeding trials using 
      leaf-associated cercomonad Cercozoa by incubating them on a standardized, diverse 
      bacterial community washed from plant leaves. We used a shotgun metagenomics 
      approach to investigate the taxonomic and functional changes of the bacterial 
      community after five days protist predation on bacteria. Predation-induced shifts in 
      bacterial community composition could be linked to phenotypic protist traits. 
      Protist reproduction rate, morphological plasticity and cell speed were most 
      important in determining bacterial community composition. Analyses of co-occurrence 
      patterns showed less complex correlations between bacterial taxa in the 
      protist-grazed treatments with a higher proportion of positive correlations than in 
      non-grazed controls, suggesting that predation reduced the influence of strong 
      competitors. Protist predation influenced 14 metabolic core functions including 
      membrane transport from which type VI secretion systems were in particular 
      upregulated. In view of the functional importance of bacterial communities in the 
      phyllosphere and rhizosphere of plants, a more detailed understanding of 
      predator-prey interactions, changes in microbial composition and function, and 
      subsequent repercussions on plant performance are clearly required.

AB  - Plants use their roots to forage for nutrients in heterogeneous soil environments, 
      but different plant species vastly differ in the intensity of foraging they perform. 
      This diversity suggests the existence of constraints on foraging at the species 
      level. We therefore examined the relationships between the intensity of root 
      foraging and plant body traits across species in order to estimate the degree of 
      coordination between plant body traits and root foraging as a form of plant 
      behavior. We cultivated 37 perennial herbaceous Central European species from open 
      terrestrial habitats in pots with three different spatial gradients of nutrient 
      availability (steep, shallow, and no gradient). We assessed the intensity of 
      foraging as differences in root placement inside pots with and without a spatial 
      gradient of resource supply. For the same set of species, we retrieved data about 
      body traits from available databases: maximum height at maturity, mean area of leaf, 
      specific leaf area, shoot lifespan, ability to self-propagate clonally, maximal 
      lateral spread (in clonal plants only), realized vegetative growth in cultivation, 
      and realized seed regeneration in cultivation. Clonal plants and plants with 
      extensive vegetative growth showed considerably weaker foraging than their 
      non-clonal or slow-growing counterparts. There was no phylogenetic signal in the 
      amount of expressed root foraging intensity. Since clonal plants foraged less than 
      non-clonals and foraging intensity did not seem to be correlated with species 
      phylogeny, we hypothesize that clonal growth itself (i.e., the ability to develop at 
      least partly self-sustaining ramets) may be an answer to soil heterogeneity. Whereas 
      unitary plants use roots as organs specialized for both resource acquisition and 
      transport to overcome spatial heterogeneity in resource supply, clonal plants 
      separate these two functions. Becoming a clonal plant allows higher specialization 
      at the organ level, since a typical clonal plant can be viewed as a network of 
      self-sustainable harvesting units connected together with specialized 
      high-throughput connection organs. This may be an effective alternative for coping 
      with spatial heterogeneity in resource availability.

AB  - The weevil Conotrachelus dubiae O'Brien & Couturier (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a 
      pest of an economically important Amazonian fruit tree Myrciaria dubia (Myrtaceae). 
      This tree grows in seasonally flooded environments, and how weevil larvae survive 
      flooding has not been studied. From December 2004 to May 2009, five experiments were 
      conducted in natural conditions and in the laboratory, with the aim of understanding 
      the mechanisms that allow the survival of C. dubiae larvae in seasonal floods in 
      Amazonia. The larvae of C. dubiae were kept under water for over 93 days. Older 
      instars exposed to periodic circulation of water survived better than younger 
      instars in addition to all larvae that were kept continuously under uncirculated 
      water. Individuals that were collected from plots of M. dubia located in flooded 
      soils and non-flooded soils did not exhibit statistically significant differences in 
      their levels of survival indicating that the variation in survival of flooding 
      events is due to phenotypic plasticity of the species and not to local adaptation by 
      the populations in different environments. We speculate that larvae can survive 
      floods without major physiological changes as larvae appear to obtain oxygen from 
      water by cutaneous diffusion, assisted by caudal movements.

PG  - 884-8

AB  - Organisms inhabiting metal-contaminated areas may develop metal tolerance, with 
      either phenotypic adjustments or genetic changes (adaptation) or with both. In the 
      present study, three populations of the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides 
      sexfasciatus, collected at an abandoned mine area, were compared to assess the 
      effects of metal contamination on tolerance to lethal and sublethal levels of 
      copper, through comparison of survival, avoidance, and feeding. The effects of metal 
      contamination on genetic diversity were considered using random amplified 
      polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. No evidence of increased metal tolerance of the 
      population inhabiting the contaminated site was found. There was no correlation 
      between metal exposure and within-population genetic variance, but the three 
      populations were clearly separated from each other. In conclusion, the populations 
      of P. sexfasciatus in the mine landscape live rather isolated from each other and 
      show no differential tolerance to Cu or indications of genetic erosion. Their 
      phenotypic plasticity provides a means to survive despite exposure to extremely high 
      metal concentrations in the soil.

AB  - Temperature provides a powerful theme for exploring environmental adaptation at all 
      levels of biological organization, from molecular kinetics to organismal fitness to 
      global biogeography. First, the thermodynamic properties that underlie biochemical 
      kinetics and protein stability determine the overall thermal sensitivity of rate 
      processes. Consequently, a single quantitative framework can assess variation in 
      thermal sensitivity of ectotherms in terms of single amino acid substitutions, 
      quantitative genetics, and interspecific differences. Thermodynamic considerations 
      predict that higher optimal temperatures will result in greater maximal fitness at 
      the optimum, a pattern seen both in interspecific comparisons and in 
      within-population genotypic variation. Second, the temperature-size rule (increased 
      developmental temperature causes decreased adult body size) is a common pattern of 
      phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. Mechanistic models can correctly predict the 
      rule in some taxa, but lab and field studies show that rapid evolution can weaken or 
      even break the rule. Third, phenotypic and evolutionary models for thermal 
      sensitivity can be combined to explore potential fitness consequences of climate 
      warming for terrestrial ectotherms. Recent analyses suggest that climate change will 
      have greater negative fitness consequences for tropical than for temperate 
      ectotherms, because many tropical species have relatively narrow thermal breadths 
      and smaller thermal safety margins.

TI  - Divergence of thermal physiological traits in terrestrial breeding frogs along a 
      tropical elevational gradient.
PG  - 3257-3267
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2929 [doi]
AB  - Critical thermal limits are thought to be correlated with the elevational 
      distribution of species living in tropical montane regions, but with upper limits 
      being relatively invariant compared to lower limits. To test this hypothesis, we 
      examined the variation of thermal physiological traits in a group of terrestrial 
      breeding frogs (Craugastoridae) distributed along a tropical elevational gradient. 
      We measured the critical thermal maximum (CT (max); n = 22 species) and critical 
      thermal minimum (CT (min); n = 14 species) of frogs captured between the Amazon 
      floodplain (250 m asl) and the high Andes (3,800 m asl). After inferring a 
      multilocus species tree, we conducted a phylogenetically informed test of whether 
      body size, body mass, and elevation contributed to the observed variation in CT 
      (max) and CT (min) along the gradient. We also tested whether CT (max) and CT (min) 
      exhibit different rates of change given that critical thermal limits (and their 
      plasticity) may have evolved differently in response to different temperature 
      constraints along the gradient. Variation of critical thermal traits was 
      significantly correlated with species' elevational midpoint, their maximum and 
      minimum elevations, as well as the maximum air temperature and the maximum operative 
      temperature as measured across this gradient. Both thermal limits showed substantial 
      variation, but CT (min) exhibited relatively faster rates of change than CT (max), 
      as observed in other taxa. Nonetheless, our findings call for caution in assuming 
      inflexibility of upper thermal limits and underscore the value of collecting 
      additional empirical data on species' thermal physiology across elevational 
      gradients.

TI  - The paleobiology and paleoecology of South African Lystrosaurus.
PG  - e10408
LID - 10.7717/peerj.10408 [doi]
LID - e10408
AB  - Lystrosaurus was one of the few tetrapods to survive the end-Permian mass extinction 
      (EPME), the most catastrophic biotic crisis in Phanerozoic history. The significant 
      increased abundance of this genus during the post-extinction Early Triassic recovery 
      period has made Lystrosaurus an iconic survivor taxon globally and ideal for 
      studying changes in growth dynamics during a mass extinction. There is potential 
      evidence of a Lilliput effect in Lystrosaurus in South Africa as the two Triassic 
      species that became highly abundant after the EPME are relatively smaller than the 
      two Permian species. In order to test this hypothesis a detailed examination of the 
      body size and life history of Permo-Triassic Lystrosaurus is required. In this 
      study, the basal skull length and growth patterns of the four South African 
      Lystrosaurus species from the Karoo Basin, L. maccaigi, L. curvatus, L. murrayi and 
      L. declivis, were examined using cranial measurements and bone histology. The basal 
      skull length measurements show that the Triassic species are smaller than the 
      Permian species and supports previous studies. The osteohistology examination of all 
      four species reveal rapidly forming fibrolamellar bone tissues during early to 
      mid-ontogeny. Growth marks are common in L. maccaigi and L. curvatus, but rare and 
      inconsistent in the purely Triassic L. murrayi and L. declivis. The inconsistency of 
      the growth marks in these latter two taxa suggests the presence of developmental 
      plasticity. This feature may have been advantageous in allowing these species to 
      alter their growth patterns in response to environmental cues in the post-extinction 
      Early Triassic climate. An overall transition to slower forming parallel-fibered 
      bone is observed in the largest individuals of L. maccaigi, but absent from the limb 
      bones of the other species. The absence of such bone tissue or outer circumferential 
      lamellae in L. curvatus, L. murrayi and L. declivis indicates that even the largest 
      collected specimens do not represent fully grown individuals. Although L. murrayi 
      and L. declivis are smaller in size, the lack of a growth asymptote in the largest 
      specimens indicates that adult individuals would have been notably larger and may 
      have been similar in size to large L. maccaigi and L. curvatus when fully grown. 
      Thus, the previously described Lilliput effect, recognized by some authors in the 
      Karoo fossil record (such as the therocephalian Moschorhinus kitchingi), may be a 
      product of high juvenile excess mortality in the Triassic rather than a strict 
      "dwarfing" of Lystrosaurus species. The lifestyle of Lystrosaurus was also 
      re-examined. Although previous studies have proposed an aquatic lifestyle for the 
      genus, the similar morphology and bone microanatomy to several other large 
      terrestrial Permo-Triassic dicynodonts supports a fully terrestrial mode of life.

AB  - In king penguin juveniles, the environmental transition from a terrestrial to a 
      marine habitat, occurring at fledging, drastically stimulates lipid catabolism and 
      the remodelling of muscle mitochondria to sustain extensive swimming activity and 
      thermoregulation in the cold circumpolar oceans. However, the exact nature of these 
      mechanisms remains only partially resolved. Here we investigated, in vitro, the 
      uncoupling effect of increasing doses of fatty acids in pectoralis muscle 
      intermyofibrillar mitochondria isolated, either from terrestrial never-immersed or 
      experimentally cold water immersed pre-fledging king penguins or from 
      sea-acclimatized fledged penguins. Mitochondria exhibited much greater 
      palmitate-induced uncoupling respiration and higher maximal oxidative capacity after 
      acclimatization to marine life. Such effects were not reproduced experimentally 
      after repeated immersions in cold water, suggesting that the plasticity of 
      mitochondrial characteristics may not be primarily driven by cold exposure per se 
      but by other aspects of sea acclimatization.

TI  - Elimination of terrestrial rabies in Western European countries.
PG  - 185-204
AB  - Since the late 1930s, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) has been the main vector of rabies 
      in Europe. Practically, decimation of fox population did not prevent the spread of 
      the disease. The only efficient method to control wildlife rabies consisted in using 
      oral vaccination by depositing vaccine baits containing a capsule or a plastic 
      sachet filled with an attenuated anti-rabies liquid vaccine throughout fox habitats. 
      Several live virus vaccines have been and are currently being used: the SAD B19 and 
      SAD P5/88 are rabies strains attenuated in cell culture, the SAG1 and SAG2 strains 
      are apathogenic mutants of an already attenuated rabies strain, and the VRG vaccine 
      is an attenuated vaccinia virus recombinant coding for the rabies glycoprotein gene. 
      These vaccines have different residual pathogenicity. SAG1 and SAG2 are pathogenic 
      only for suckling mice inoculated by intracerebral and oral routes. VRG presents 
      absolutely no rabies risk to humans and the environment and the residual 
      pathogenicity of the vaccinia vector virus is very low even for humans. Other 
      parameters such as the thermostability of the vaccine and the melting point of the 
      bait casing are of utmost importance to guarantee the success of oral vaccination 
      campaigns. Additionally, VRG is the only vaccine that did not interfere with 
      maternal immunity in fox cubs, an important issue for spring campaigns. Successes 
      and failure of national programmes confirm that whatever the ecological conditions, 
      the same rules must be strictly followed to ensure the success of rabies elimination 
      programmes: (i) considering the strategy, any rabies vaccination programme must be 
      organised with the support of a national scientific team specially designated for 
      the task that will have to apply the only methods that have already been proved 
      successful elsewhere in Europe, including rabies surveillance, bait distribution 
      calendar and pattern, and monitoring of this distribution; (ii) vaccination must be 
      pursued for at least two years after the last reported case of rabies in the area; 
      (iii) the choice of a low cost but poorly efficient and poorly stable vaccine does 
      not prove to be cost-beneficial for successful elimination of rabies. Several 
      European countries have become rabies-free: Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Italy, 
      Switzerland, Finland and the Netherlands. Since the European Union is going comprise 
      25 countries from May 2004, all the scientific knowledge is available for 
      establishing efficient and adapted oral programmes aimed at eliminating terrestrial 
      rabies from this area.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are pollutants formed by plastics ≤ 5 mm and are present in 
      marine and terrestrial environments. Due to their large surface to volume ratio and 
      chemical surface properties, MPs adsorb hazardous chemicals from their surrounding 
      environment. When MPs are consumed by fauna, they transfer those substances through 
      the trophic chain. An essential issue of MPs is their disposal. Due to their size, 
      the disposal methods commonly used for plastic items are not suited for MPs. Here, 
      photocatalysis in an aqueous medium is proposed as an alternative to fight MPs 
      pollution. Although the photocatalysis of MPs has been reported, the effect of 
      operating variables in the process has not been investigated. To fill this gap, the 
      impact of pH and temperature on the degradation process of HDPE MPs was investigated 
      using C,N-TiO(2) and visible light. Degradation was followed by mass loss, carbonyl 
      index calculation and microscopy. It was found that photocatalysis at low 
      temperature (0 °C) increases MPs' surface area by fragmentation, and low pH value 
      (pH 3) favours hydroperoxide formation during photooxidation. By using the design of 
      experiments tool, it was demonstrated that there is a combined effect of pH and 
      temperature in the photocatalysis of HDPE MPs.

AB  - As a carbon-based life form living in a predominantly carbon-based environment, it 
      is not surprising that we have created a carbon-based consumer society. Our 
      principle sources of energy are carbon-based (coal, oil, and gas) and many of our 
      consumer goods are derived from organic (i.e., carbon-based) chemicals (including 
      plastics, fabrics and materials, personal care and cleaning products, dyes, and 
      coatings). Even our large-volume inorganic-chemicals-based industries, including 
      fertilizers and construction materials, rely on the consumption of carbon, notably 
      in the form of large amounts of energy. The environmental problems which we now face 
      and of which we are becoming increasingly aware result from a human-induced 
      disturbance in the natural carbon cycle of the Earth caused by transferring large 
      quantities of terrestrial carbon (coal, oil, and gas) to the atmosphere, mostly in 
      the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon is by no means the only element whose natural 
      cycle we have disturbed: we are transferring significant quantities of elements 
      including phosphorus, sulfur, copper, and platinum from natural sinks or ores built 
      up over millions of years to unnatural fates in the form of what we refer to as 
      waste or pollution. However, our complete dependence on the carbon cycle means that 
      its disturbance deserves special attention, as is now manifest in indicators such as 
      climate change and escalating public concern over global warming. As with all 
      disturbances in materials balances, we can seek to alleviate the problem by (1) 
      dematerialization: a reduction in consumption; (2) rematerialization: a change in 
      what we consume; or (3) transmaterialization: changing our attitude towards 
      resources and waste. The "low-carbon" mantra that is popularly cited by 
      organizations ranging from nongovernmental organizations to multinational companies 
      and from local authorities to national governments is based on a combination of (1) 
      and (2) (reducing carbon consumption though greater efficiency and lower per capita 
      consumption, and replacing fossil energy sources with sources such as wind, wave, 
      and solar, respectively). "Low carbon" is of inherently less value to the chemical 
      and plastics industries at least in terms of raw materials although a version of 
      (2), the use of biomass, does apply, especially if we use carbon sources that are 
      renewable on a human timescale. There is however, another renewable, natural source 
      of carbon that is widely available and for which greater utilization would help 
      restore material balance and the natural cycle for carbon in terms of resource and 
      waste. CO(2), perhaps the most widely discussed and feared chemical in modern 
      society, is as fundamental to our survival as water, and like water we need to 
      better understand the human as well as natural production and consumption of CO(2) 
      so that we can attempt to get these into a sustainable balance. Current utilization 
      of this valuable resource by the chemical industry is only 90 megatonne per year, 
      compared to the 26.3 gigatonne CO(2) generated annually by combustion of fossil 
      fuels for energy generation, as such significant opportunities exist for increased 
      utilization of CO(2) generated from industrial processes. It is also essential that 
      renewable energy is used if CO(2) is to be utilized as a C1 building block.

TI  - Do Microplastics Enter Our Food Chain Via Root Vegetables? A Raman Based 
      Spectroscopic Study on Raphanus sativus.
LID - 10.3390/ma14092329 [doi]
LID - 2329
AB  - The outburst of plastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems poses a potential threat 
      to agriculture and food safety. Studies have already provided evidence for the 
      uptake of plastic microparticles by several plant species, accompanied by numerous 
      developmental effects, using fluorescence labelling techniques. Here, we introduce 
      the implementation of confocal Raman spectroscopy, a label-free method, for the 
      effective detection of microplastics (MPs) accumulation in the roots of a common 
      edible root vegetable plant, Raphanus sativus, after treatment with acrylonitrile 
      butadiene styrene (ABS) powder. We also demonstrate the concomitant occurrence of 
      phenotypic defects in the polymer-treated plants. We anticipate that this work can 
      provide new insights not only into the extent of the impact this widespread 
      phenomenon has on crop plants but also on the methodological requirements to address 
      it.

AB  - Large quantities of microplastics with small particle sizes were found in the South 
      China Sea (SCS). The abundances of microplastics in seawater were 0.045±0.093and 
      2569±1770particles/m(3) according to the bongo net and pumping sampling methods, 
      respectively. Smaller-size fractions (size<0.3mm) contributed 92% of the number of 
      microplastics to the total load. Continental slope is the largest reservoir of 
      microplastics with an inventory of 295tons. 21 polymer types were found in the 
      samples using the micro Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), among which 
      alkyds (22.5%) and polycaprolactone (PCL) (20.9%) accounted for almost half of the 
      total polymer content. Lighter plastics would not only concentrate upon the coastal 
      area, being more likely to drift further into open seas with ocean currents. The 
      distribution characteristics showed that it was mainly controlled by terrestrial 
      input of the Pearl River. This study, as the first report from SCS on microplastics 
      in water for its distribution and influence factors, provided impetus for further 
      research on the transportation fate and the behavior of this emerging pollutant from 
      coastal zone to the open oceans.

TI  - Personality affects defensive behaviour of Porcellioscaber (Isopoda, Oniscidea).
PG  - 159-71
LID - 10.3897/zookeys.515.9429 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated individual behavioural patterns of isopods expressed as tonic 
      immobility following some intrusive treatments. Common rough woodlice, 
      Porcellioscaber, were kept individually in plastic boxes and tested for tonic 
      immobility repeatedly. Reactivity, sensitivity (number of stimuli needed to 
      respond), and endurance of tonic immobility (TI) according three types of treatments 
      (touch, squeeze, drop) were evaluated. Touch was the weakest treatment and it was 
      necessary to repeat it a number of times to obtain a response; while squeeze and 
      drop induced TI more frequently. Nevertheless, duration of the response persisted 
      for a longer time with the touch treatment. Within each set of the three treatment, 
      the strongest response was the third one, regardless of treatment type. Duration of 
      reaction was affected by the size of the woodlouse, the smallest individuals 
      feigning death for the shortest time. Despite body size, we found a significant 
      individual pattern of endurance of TI among tested woodlice, which was stable across 
      treatments as well as across time (5 repetitions during a 3 week period). 
      Porcellioscaber is one of the first species of terrestrial isopods with documented 
      personality traits.

TI  - Hermit crabs perceive the extent of their virtual bodies.
PG  - 495-7
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2012.0085 [doi]
AB  - A flexible body image is required by animals if they are to adapt to body changes 
      and move effectively within a structurally complex environment. Here, we show that 
      terrestrial hermit crabs, Coenobita rugosus, which frequently change shells, can 
      modify walking behaviour, dependent on the shape of the shell. Hermit crabs walked 
      along a corridor that had alternating left and right corners; if it was narrow at 
      the corner, crabs rotated their bodies to avoid the wall, indicating an awareness of 
      environmental obstacles. This rotation increased when a plastic plate was attached 
      to the shell. We suggest that the shell, when extended by the plate, becomes 
      assimilated to the hermit crab's own body. While there are cases of a tool being 
      assimilated with the body, our result is the first example of the habitat where an 
      animal lives and/or carries being part of a virtual body.

TI  - Numerical modelling of floating debris in the world's oceans.
PG  - 653-61
LID - 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.10.027 [doi]
AB  - A global ocean circulation model is coupled to a Lagrangian particle tracking model 
      to simulate 30 years of input, transport and accumulation of floating debris in the 
      world ocean. Using both terrestrial and maritime inputs, the modelling results 
      clearly show the formation of five accumulation zones in the subtropical latitudes 
      of the major ocean basins. The relative size and concentration of each clearly 
      illustrate the dominance of the accumulation zones in the northern hemisphere, while 
      smaller seas surrounded by densely populated areas are also shown to have a high 
      concentration of floating debris. We also determine the relative contribution of 
      different source regions to the total amount of material in a particular 
      accumulation zone. This study provides a framework for describing the transport, 
      distribution and accumulation of floating marine debris and can be continuously 
      updated and adapted to assess scenarios reflecting changes in the production and 
      disposal of plastic worldwide.

TI  - Synaptic innervation of the giant cerebral neuron in sated and hungry snails.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - The giant cerebral neuron (GCN) is a serotoninergic cell that facilitates feeding 
      behaviour in gastropod molluscs. We have examined the morphology of its cerebral 
      arborizations after labelling them by intracellular injection of hexamminecobalt. 
      Observations in the light microscope reveal extensive arborizations, with similar 
      overall distributions, in the terrestrial snails Achatina fulica and Rumina 
      decollata. All the major peripheral nerves terminate within the zone covered by the 
      GCN arbor. In a sample of 370 synapses in which the GCN participated, the GCN was 
      identified as the postsynaptic element in every case, thereby establishing the 
      dendritic nature of the cerebral arborizations. A total of approximately 1,000 
      synapses contacts the GCN, with no evident regional differences in innervation 
      density. The synaptic membrane of the presynaptic profile is characterized by an 
      agglomeration of small clear vesicles and small dense vesicles. At nonsynaptic 
      membranes there are agglomerations of larger dense and dense core vesicles, 
      suggestive of nonsynaptic release. The dendrites of the GCN also contain vesicles. 
      Starvation for five days (Rumina decollata) caused a significant increase in the 
      proportion of curved synapses relative to flat synapses. This might be a plastic 
      change allowing for a greater efficiency of transmission between sensory afferents 
      and the GCN.

AB  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for Ethiopian rose cultivation. The LCA 
      covered the cradle-to-gate production of all inputs to Ethiopian rose cultivation up 
      to, and including transport to the Ethiopian airport. Primary data were collected 
      about materials and resources used as inputs to, and about the product outputs from 
      21 farms in 4 geographical regions (i.e. Holleta, Sebeta, Debre Ziet, and Ziway). 
      The primary data were imported in, and analyzed with the SimaPro7.3 software. Data 
      for the production of used inputs were taken from the EcoInvent®2.0 database. 
      Emissions from input use on the farms were quantified based on estimates and 
      emission factors from various studies and guidelines. The resulting life cycle 
      inventory (LCI) table was next evaluated with the CML 2 baseline 2000 V2/world, 
      1990/characterization method to quantify the contribution of the rose cultivation 
      chain to 10 environmental impact categories. The set of collected primary data was 
      comprehensive and of high quality. The data point to an intensive use of 
      fertilizers, pesticides, and greenhouse plastic. Production and use of these inputs 
      also represent the major contributors in all environmental impact categories. The 
      largest contribution comes from the production of the used fertilizers, specifically 
      nitrogen-based fertilizers. The use of calcium nitrate dominates Abiotic Depletion 
      (AD), Global Warming (GW), Human Toxicity (HT) and Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity 
      (MAET). It also makes a large contribution to Ozone Depletion (OD), Acidification 
      (AD) and Fresh water Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET). Acidification (AC) and 
      Eutrophication (EU) are dominated by the emission of fertilizers. The emissions from 
      the use of pesticides, especially insecticides dominate Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE) 
      and make a considerable contribution to Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET) and 
      Photochemical Oxidation (PhO). There is no visible contribution from the use of 
      pesticides to the other toxicity categories. Production and use of greenhouse 
      plastic are another important contributors, and just a bit less than the 
      contribution of calcium nitrate to Abiotic Depletion (AD). The results of this study 
      clearly indicate nutrient management and emissions from pesticide use, especially 
      insecticides, as a focus point for environmental optimization of the rose 
      cultivation sector in Ethiopia.

AB  - Various chemical substances, such as potentially toxic trace metals, are used as 
      plastic additives to improve the performance of polymers and extend the service life 
      of plastic products. However, these added trace metals are likely released from 
      plastic into the environment when the plastic becomes a pollutant, although the 
      process is poorly understood. In this study, chemical ageing of commercial polyvinyl 
      chloride (PVC) microplastics using hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and natural ageing 
      of PVC that had been added to an alkaline paddy soil were undertaken to evaluate the 
      potential release of trace metals from PVC. Enhanced release of trace metals from 
      PVC with the increasing H(2)O(2) concentrations was observed, in which the released 
      Pb was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than other metals (p < 0.01). The released Cr, 
      Ni, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd and Mn accounted for 87.37%, 79.27%, 22.02%, 20.93%, 17.06%, 
      15.11%, and 11.02% of their total concentrations (0.28 ± 0.03, 0.08 ± 0.01, 
      13.67 ± 0.18, 1.07 ± 0.02, 2.20 ± 0.18, 0.05 ± 0.00 and 1.26 ± 0.08 mmol kg(-1)) in 
      PVC after ageing with 30% H(2)O(2), respectively. Compared with the control 
      treatment without PVC addition, the concentrations of CaCl(2)-extractable Cu, Mn, 
      Ni, Pb, and Zn in the soil treated with 5% PVC are significantly increased after 
      incubation for 60 days (p < 0.01). In conclusion, chemical and natural ageing have 
      the potential to lead to the release of Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn from the commercial 
      PVC into aquatic and terrestrial environments.

TI  - Human health risk on environmental exposure to Bisphenol-A: a review.
PG  - 225-55
AB  - Bisphenol-A (BPA), identified as an environmental hormone (i.e., endocrine 
      disruptor), is an industrially important chemical that is being used as a primary 
      raw material for the production of engineering plastics (e.g., polycarbonate/epoxy 
      resins), food cans (i.e., lacquer coatings), and dental composites/sealants. From 
      the ecotoxicology, human health and regulatory points of view, it is urgent to 
      restrict the emissions and releases of the estrogenic chemical from the industrial 
      processes and commercial products. This article reviews BPA in the current 
      literature in terms of physiochemical properties, industrial/commercial uses, 
      environmental distributions in the atmospheric/aquatic/terrestrial phases, possible 
      human toxicity, and its exposure standards and limits. Emphasis is put on the most 
      significant distribution in the aquatic environment, and occupational and 
      non-occupational human exposures. Overall, it is strongly convinced that BPA is not 
      a carcinogenic risk to humans, and is also rapidly glucuronidated and excreted 
      through the route of urine.

TI  - Sex- and context-dependent migration in a pond-breeding amphibian.
PG  - 306-12
AB  - Partial migration, variation in the percentage of a population that completes a 
      migration, can be influenced by the local environment and condition of an 
      individual. We examined the direct and interacting effects of habitat quality and 
      gender on migration decision by manipulating population density and sex ratio in a 
      factorial field experiment using aquatic enclosures. In partially migrating 
      red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), we measured the percentage of newts 
      migrating to the terrestrial habitat vs. overwintering as pond residents. Density 
      significantly influenced migration, with 63% of newts migrating from high-density 
      enclosures compared to 39% from low-density enclosures. Newts also migrated earlier 
      from high-density enclosures, but no significant effects of the sex ratio treatment 
      were found. Females migrated earlier than males, and 64% more females developed the 
      migrant phenotype, suggesting important sex-based trade-offs of migration. No 
      differences were found between migrants and residents in initial body size, counter 
      to our prediction that larger individuals would be more likely to remain pond 
      residents. This study demonstrates experimentally that migration can be a plastic 
      response influenced by both local density and gender.

TI  - Experimental exposure to cadmium affects metallothionein-like protein levels but not

AB  - Both local adaptation and acclimation in tolerance mechanisms may allow populations 
      to persist under metal pollution. However, both mechanisms are presumed to incur 
      (energetic) costs and to trade-off with other life-history traits. To test this 
      hypothesis, we exposed Pardosa saltans (Lycosidae) spiderlings originating from 
      metal-polluted and unpolluted sites to a controlled cadmium (Cd) treatment, and 
      compared contents of metal-binding metallothionein-like proteins (MTLPs), internal 
      metal concentrations, and individual survival and growth rates with a reference 
      treatment. While increased MTLP concentrations in offspring originating from both 
      polluted and unpolluted populations upon exposure indicates a plastic tolerance 
      mechanism, survival and growth rates remain largely unaffected, independent of the 
      population of origin. However, MTLP and Cd concentrations were not significantly 
      correlated. We suggest that MTLP production may be an important mechanism enabling 
      P. saltans populations to persist in ecosystems polluted with heavy metals above a 
      certain level.

      rhizosphere].
PG  - 1761-4
AB  - With plastic rhizobox system, this paper studied the degradation behavior of 
      methamidophos in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere of phaiozem and burozem planted 
      with soybean. The results suggested that methamidophos could be rapidly decomposed 
      in soil environment despite its higher acute toxicity, and its residual amount in 
      phaiozem was generally below the level in burozem under same condition. In the 
      absence of soybean (control), the residual amount of methamidophos at the 2nd day of 
      incubation was about 33% in burozem, whereas only about 26% in phaiozem. An 
      accelerated degradation of methamidophos in soybean rhizospheric soil was observed, 
      especially in phaiozem. At the 9th day of incubation, the insecticide residue in the 
      middle rhizobox phaiozem and burozem with soybean was decreased by 87.5% and 76.0%, 
      respectively, compared with that of the control. The degradation process of 
      methamidophos in soil environment followed the first-order equation, and its 
      half-life was about 2 days.

TI  - Hydrothermal liquefaction of Malaysia's algal biomass for high-quality bio-oil 
      production.
PG  - 246-269
LID - 10.1002/elsc.201800144 [doi]
AB  - Currently, fossil materials form the majority of our energy and chemical source. 
      Many global concerns force us to rethink about our current dependence on the fossil 
      energy. Limiting the use of these energy sources is a key priority for most 
      countries that pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The application of 
      biomass, as substitute fossil resources for producing biofuels, plastics and 
      chemicals, is a widely accepted strategy for sustainable development. Aquatic plants 
      including algae possess competitive advantages as biomass resources compared to the 
      terrestrial plants in this current global situation. Bio-oil production from algal 
      biomass is technically and economically viable, cost competitive, requires no 
      capacious lands and minimal water use and reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide. The 
      aim of this paper is to review the potential of converting algal biomass, as an 
      aquatic plant, into high-quality crude bio-oil through applicable processes in 
      Malaysia. In particular, bio-based materials and fuels from algal biomass are 
      considered as one of the reliable alternatives for clean energy. Currently, 
      pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) are two foremost processes for bio-oil 
      production from biomass. HTL can directly convert high-moisture algal biomass into 
      bio-oil, whereas pyrolysis requires feedstock drying to reduce the energy 
      consumption during the process. Microwave-assisted HTL, which can be conducted in 
      aqueous environment, is suitable for aquatic plants and wet biomass such as algae.

AB  - Eco-ditches are being explored to maximize their capability of capturing pollutants 
      and mitigate any harmful side effects in rivers. In this study, mesocosm plastic 
      drum sediment and field experiments were set up to screen 18 plant species found in 
      ditches and identify those with potential for high biomass production and nutrients 
      removal. Terrestrial plants grown in the mesocosm system were shown to be able to 
      acclimate to aquatic conditions and to survive in primary domestic sewage. About 
      73-95% increase in plant biomass was recorded. Removal efficiencies for total 
      nitrogen, total phosphorus, and ammonium-nitrogen from the sewage of 72-99%, 64-99%, 
      and 75-100%, respectively, were recorded. Furthermore, complete removal of the 
      applied nitrate-nitrogen load was achieved in mesocosm systems. Findings also show 
      that all species, but especially Acorus calamus, Canna indica, Canna lily, Cyperus 
      alternifolius, Colocasia gigantea, Eichhornia crassipes, Iris sibirica, and Typha 
      latifolia had the highest efficiencies for nitrogen and phosphorous removal. The N 
      and P mass balance analysis demonstrated that plant uptake and sediment N and P 
      accumulation accounted for 41-86% and 18-49% of the total influent TN and TP loads, 
      respectively. In addition, the amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous uptake by these 
      plant species were influenced significantly by biomass. The field-culture experiment 
      further identified Canna indica followed by Cyperus alternifolius as the most 
      promising for high biomass production and nutrients uptake. Therefore, these plants 
      may be recommended for extensive use in treating highly eutrophicated rivers. 
      Outcomes of this work can be useful for model design specifications in eco-ditch 
      mitigation of sewage pollution.

LID - 10.1007/s00360-014-0862-8 [doi]
AB  - The function and mechanism underlying discontinuous gas exchange in terrestrial 
      arthropods continues to be debated. Three adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to 
      explain the evolutionary origin or maintenance of discontinuous gas exchange cycles 
      (DGCs), which may have evolved to reduce respiratory water loss, facilitate gas 
      exchange in high CO2 and low O2 micro-environments, or to ameliorate potential 
      damage as a result of oversupply of O2. None of these hypotheses have unequivocal 
      support, and several non-adaptive hypotheses have also been proposed. In the present 
      study, we reared cockroaches Nauphoeta cinerea in selected levels of O2 throughout 
      development, and examined how this affected growth rate, tracheal morphology and 
      patterns of gas exchange. O2 level in the rearing environment caused significant 
      changes in tracheal morphology and the exhibition of DGCs, but the direction of 
      these effects was inconsistent with all three adaptive hypotheses: water loss was 
      not associated with DGC length, cockroaches grew fastest in hyperoxia, and DGCs 
      exhibited by cockroaches reared in normoxia were shorter than those exhibited by 
      cockroaches reared in hypoxia or hyperoxia.

TI  - Allometric growth and allocation in forests: a perspective from FLUXNET.
PG  - 1546-56
AB  - To develop a scheme for partitioning the products of photosynthesis toward different 
      biomass components in land-surface models, a database on component mass and net 
      primary productivity (NPP), collected from FLUXNET sites, was examined to determine 
      allometric patterns of allocation. We found that NPP per individual of foliage 
      (Gfol), stem and branches (Gstem), coarse roots (Gcroot) and fine roots (Gfroot) in 
      individual trees is largely explained (r2 = 67-91%) by the magnitude of total NPP 
      per individual (G). Gfol scales with G isometrically, meaning it is a fixed fraction 
      of G ( 25%). Root-shoot trade-offs were manifest as a slow decline in Gfroot, as a 
      fraction of G, from 50% to 25% as stands increased in biomass, with Gstem and Gcroot 
      increasing as a consequence. These results indicate that a functional trade-off 
      between aboveground and belowground allocation is essentially captured by variations 
      in G, which itself is largely governed by stand biomass and only secondarily by 
      site-specific resource availability. We argue that forests are characterized by 
      strong competition for light, observed as a race for individual trees to ascend by 
      increasing partitioning toward wood, rather than by growing more leaves, and that 
      this competition stronglyconstrains the allocational plasticity that trees may be 
      capable of. The residual variation in partitioning was not related to climatic or 
      edaphic factors, nor did plots with nutrient or water additions show a pattern of 
      partitioning distinct from that predicted by G alone. These findings leverage 
      short-term process studies of the terrestrial carbon cycle to improve decade-scale 
      predictions of biomass accumulation in forests. An algorithm for calculating 
      partitioning in land-surface models is presented.

TI  - Ants (Formicidae): models for social complexity.
PG  - pdb.emo125
LID - 10.1101/pdb.emo125 [doi]
AB  - The family Formicidae (ants) is composed of more than 12,000 described species that 
      vary greatly in size, morphology, behavior, life history, ecology, and social 
      organization. Ants occur in most terrestrial habitats and are the dominant animals 
      in many of them. They have been used as models to address fundamental questions in 
      ecology, evolution, behavior, and development. The literature on ants is extensive, 
      and the natural history of many species is known in detail. Phylogenetic 
      relationships for the family, as well as within many subfamilies, are known, 
      enabling comparative studies. Their ease of sampling and ecological variation makes 
      them attractive for studying populations and questions relating to communities. 
      Their sociality and variation in social organization have contributed greatly to an 
      understanding of complex systems, division of labor, and chemical communication. 
      Ants occur in colonies composed of tens to millions of individuals that vary greatly 
      in morphology, physiology, and behavior; this variation has been used to address 
      proximate and ultimate mechanisms generating phenotypic plasticity. Relatedness 
      asymmetries within colonies have been fundamental to the formulation and empirical 
      testing of kin and group selection theories. Genomic resources have been developed 
      for some species, and a whole-genome sequence for several species is likely to 
      follow in the near future; comparative genomics in ants should provide new insights 
      into the evolution of complexity and sociogenomics. Future studies using ants should 
      help establish a more comprehensive understanding of social life, from molecules to 
      colonies.

TI  - Histochemistry of the extracellular matrix in the snail central nervous system.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Even tough the central nervous system (CNS) of gastropods has long been used as a 
      model for studying different neuronal networks underlying behaviors, there is only 
      little information on the molecular components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of 
      the nervous tissue. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify some of 
      the ECM molecules by acid-base histochemistry. Staining with alcian blue at strong 
      acidic pH, and with acridine orange at different pH and salt concentrations was 
      carried out on cryostat sections taken from CNS preparations of adult specimens of 
      the terrestrial snail, Helix pomatia, and the aquatic species, Lymnaea stagnolis, in 
      order to visualize mild (carboxyl) and strong (sulphate) acidic groups, which are 
      characteristic for different glucosaminoglycans. According to our findings, 
      sulphated proteoglycans were abundant in the periganglionic sheath of both species, 
      and they also occurred in the neuropil of Helix, whereas they were absent in 
      Lymnaea. The interperikaryonal space contained mainly carboxyl residues, which might 
      refer to the presence of hyaluronic acid. It is concluded that the ECM of the snail 
      CNS, similarly to that in vertebrates, is partly composed of polymer macromolecules 
      of different chemical properties. It is suggested that adaptation to environmental 
      conditions and/or altered neuronal plasticity are responsible for the differences 
      found in chemical characters of the ECM molecules between the two snail species.

TI  - A soluble 3D LC/MS/MS proteome of the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme.
PG  - 3096-104
AB  - Nostoc punctiforme is an oxygenic photoautotrophic cyanobacterium with multiple 
      developmental states, which can form nitrogen-fixing symbioses with a variety of 
      terrestrial plants. 3D LC/MS/MS shotgun peptide sequencing was used to analyze the 
      proteome when N. punctiforme is grown in continuous moderate light with ammonia as 
      the nitrogen source. The soluble proteome includes 1575 proteins, 50% of which can 
      be assigned to core metabolic and transport functions. Another 39% are assigned to 
      proteins with no known function, a substantially higher fraction than in the 
      Escherichia coli proteome. Many expressed proteins protect against oxidative and 
      light stress. Seventy-one sensor histidine kinases, response regulators, and 
      serine/threonine kinases, individually and as hybrid, multidomain proteins, were 
      identified, reflecting a substantial capacity to sense and respond to environmental 
      change. Proteins encoded by each of the five N. punctiforme plasmids were 
      identified, as were 10 transposases, reflecting the plasticity of the N. punctiforme 
      genome. This core proteome sets the stage for comparison with that of other 
      developmental states.

TI  - The role of urban forest patches in maintaining isopod diversity (Oniscidea).
PG  - 371-388
LID - 10.3897/zookeys.801.22829 [doi]
AB  - Compositional changes in natural communities associated with anthropogenic influence 
      often lead to localised extinctions and biodiversity loss. Soil invertebrates are 
      also threatened by urbanisation due to habitat fragmentation, vegetation changes and 
      management, soil alteration, degradation, and disappearing shelter sites. The aim 
      was to assess terrestrial isopod (Oniscidea) assemblages in differently degraded 
      urban forest patches of a metropolitan area (Budapest, Hungary). Study sites were 
      compared by their species richness, composition and the relevant background factors 
      (soil properties, dead wood, litter characteristics, and canopy closure). The degree 
      of urban disturbance was expressed using an urbanisation index (UI) based on 
      built-up density and vegetation cover. The isopods were identified to species level, 
      and were qualified by their habitat preference and naturalness index (TINI). Average 
      Rarity Index (ARI), derived from TINIs provided information on the degree of 
      naturalness/disturbance of each habitat. Altogether 14 isopod species were collected 
      from 23 sample sites. Urbanisation indirectly affected on the composition of isopod 
      assemblages through the quantity of dead wood and soil plasticity. ARIs and UIs of 
      sample sites were negatively correlated. Urban patches harboured habitat generalist, 
      synanthropic and established introduced species with low naturalness value of 
      assemblages. Areas with no or low anthropogenic disturbance maintained stable 
      native, autochthonous assemblages that were characteristic of rural sites in the 
      region. Transitional zones between rural and urban habitats usually maintained a 
      mixed isopod fauna consisting of both urban and rural elements.

AB  - Terrestrial ectotherms are challenged by variation in both mean and variance of 
      temperature. Phenotypic plasticity (thermal acclimation) might mitigate adverse 
      effects, however, we lack a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of 
      thermal acclimation and how they are affected by fluctuating temperature. Here we 
      investigated the effect of thermal acclimation in Drosophila melanogaster on 
      critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and associated global gene expression profiles as 
      induced by two constant and two ecologically relevant (non-stressful) diurnally 
      fluctuating temperature regimes. Both mean and fluctuation of temperature 
      contributed to thermal acclimation and affected the transcriptome. The 
      transcriptomic response to mean temperatures comprised modification of a major part 
      of the transcriptome, while the response to fluctuations affected a much smaller set 
      of genes, which was highly independent of both the response to a change in mean 
      temperature and to the classic heat shock response. Although the independent 
      transcriptional effects caused by fluctuations were relatively small, they are 
      likely to contribute to our understanding of thermal adaptation. We provide evidence 
      that environmental sensing, particularly phototransduction, is a central mechanism 
      underlying the regulation of thermal acclimation to fluctuating temperatures. Thus, 
      genes and pathways involved in phototransduction are likely of importance in 
      fluctuating climates.

      SUMMARY: Speciation of fungal plant pathogens has been associated with host jumps, 
      host domestication, clonal divergence, and hybridization. Although we have 
      substantial insight into the speciation histories of several important plant 
      pathogens, we still know very little about the underlying genetics of reproductive 
      isolation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, and nonfungal 
      model systems illustrate that reproductive barriers can evolve by different 
      mechanisms, including genetic incompatibilities between neutral and adaptive 
      substitutions, reinforcement selection, and chromosomal rearrangements. Advances in 
      genome sequencing and sequence analyses provide a new framework to identify those 
      traits that have driven the divergence of populations or caused reproductive 
      isolation between species of fungal plant pathogens. These traits can be recognized 
      based on signatures of strong divergent selection between species or through the 
      association of allelic combination conferring hybrid inferiority. Comparative genome 
      analyses also provide information about the contribution of genome rearrangements to 
      speciation. This is particularly relevant for species of fungal pathogens with 
      extreme levels of genomic rearrangements and within-species genome plasticity.

AB  - Dispersal evolution impacts the fluxes of individuals and hence, connectivity in 
      metapopulations. Connectivity is therefore decoupled from the structural 
      connectedness of the patches within the spatial network. Because of demographic 
      feedbacks, local selection also drives the evolution of other life history traits. 
      We investigated how different levels of connectedness affect trait evolution in 
      experimental metapopulations of the two-spotted spider mite. We separated local- and 
      metapopulation-level selection and linked trait divergence to population dynamics. 
      With lower connectedness, an increased starvation resistance and delayed dispersal 
      evolved. Reproductive performance evolved locally by transgenerational plasticity or 
      epigenetic processes. Costs of dispersal, but also changes in local densities and 
      temporal fluctuations herein are found to be putative drivers. In addition to 
      dispersal, demographic traits are able to evolve in response to metapopulation 
      connectedness at both the local and metapopulation level by genetic and/or 
      non-genetic inheritance. These trait changes impact the persistence of spatially 
      structured populations.

TI  - Relationships between seasonal thermal variations and cell proliferation in 
      heterothermic vertebrates, as revealed by PCNA expression in the brain of adult 
      Podarcis sicula.
PG  - 29-37
AB  - In adult terrestrial heterothermic vertebrates, spontaneous or experimentally 
      induced plasticity of the brain is widely demonstrated. This phenomenon is more 
      pronounced in Amphibians than in lacertilians, the most investigated among the 
      Reptiles. In the lizard it has been observed that the summer photoperiod and 
      temperature exert a positive influence on the proliferative activity of cerebral 
      putative stem cells, which then differentiate into glial or neuronal cells. In the 
      present investigation, the behaviour of proliferating neural cells has been 
      investigated by immunocytochemistry in the brain of normal adult Podarcis sicula 
      caught in their habitat in summer. The results, qualitatively evaluated, were 
      compared with those on normal lizards of the same species, caught from the wild in 
      late spring and previously analysed by the same author. The comparison showed that 
      summer environment stimulates cell proliferation, although to a limited extent. This 
      response seems to involve the quiescent cells which mainly populate the ependymal 
      layer of the forebrain, the telencephalic hemispheres being the best provided with 
      these undifferentiated cells, while no substantial differences from spring values 
      were found in more caudal cerebral portions. The comparison between present findings 
      and previously reported ones indicates that summer environment stimulates the 
      proliferation of putative neuronal stem cells but only in the forebrain; this 
      proliferation might not be sufficient to support the regeneration upon partial 
      removal of this portion of the encephalon, and previous findings of a much higher 
      regenerative capacity in the lizard brain upon cerebral injury might depend on 
      factors linked to injury itself or to the studied species and their habitat.

TI  - Tameness and stress physiology in a predator-naive island species confronted with 
      novel predation threat.
PG  - 577-82
AB  - Tame behaviour, i.e. low wariness, in terrestrial island species is often attributed 
      to low predation pressure. However, we know little about its physiological control 
      and its flexibility in the face of predator introductions. Marine iguanas 
      (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) on the Galapagos Islands are a good model to study the 
      physiological correlates of low wariness. They have lived virtually without 
      predation for 5-15 Myr until some populations were first confronted with feral cats 
      and dogs some 150 years ago. We tested whether and to what extent marine iguanas can 
      adjust their behaviour and endocrine stress response to novel predation threats. 
      Here, we show that a corticosterone stress response to experimental chasing is 
      absent in naive animals, but is quickly restored with experience. Initially, low 
      wariness also increases with experience, but remains an order of magnitude too low 
      to allow successful escape from introduced predators. Our data suggest that the 
      ability of marine iguanas to cope with predator introductions is limited by narrow 
      reaction norms for behavioural wariness rather than by constraints in the underlying 
      physiological stress system. In general, we predict that island endemics show 
      flexible physiological stress responses but are restricted by narrow behavioural 
      plasticity.

TI  - Docosahexaenoic acid, the aquatic diet, and hominin encephalization: difficulties in 
      establishing evolutionary links.
PG  - 132-41
AB  - Distinctive characteristics of modern humans, including language, tool manufacture 
      and use, culture, and behavioral plasticity, are linked to changes in the 
      organization and size of the brain during hominin evolution. As brain tissue is 
      metabolically and nutritionally costly to develop and maintain, early hominin 
      encephalization has been linked to a release of energetic and nutritional 
      constraints. One such nutrient-based approach has focused on the n-3 long-chained 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is a primary 
      constituent of membrane phospholipids within the synaptic networks of the brain 
      essential for optimal cognitive functioning. As biosynthesis of DHA from n-3 dietary 
      precursors (alpha-linolenic acid, LNA) is relatively inefficient, it has been 
      suggested that preformed DHA must have been an integral dietary constituent during 
      evolution of the genus Homo to facilitate the growth and development of an 
      encephalizing brain. Furthermore, preformed DHA has only been identified to an 
      appreciable extent within aquatic resources (marine and freshwater), leading to 
      speculation that hominin encephalization is linked specifically to access and 
      consumption of aquatic resources. The key premise of this perspective is that 
      biosynthesis of DHA from LNA is not only inefficient but also insufficient for the 
      growth and maturation demands of an encephalized brain. However, this assumption is 
      not well-supported, and much evidence instead suggests that consumption of LNA, 
      available in a wider variety of sources within a number of terrestrial ecosystems, 
      is sufficient for normal brain development and maintenance in modern humans and 
      presumably our ancestors.

TI  - Natural nest substrates influence squamate embryo physiology but have little effect 
      on hatchling phenotypes.
LID - 10.1111/1749-4877.12553 [doi]
AB  - Vertebrate embryos require access to water; however, many species nest in 
      terrestrial habitats that vary considerably in moisture content. Oviparous, 
      non-avian reptiles have served as models to understand how environmental factors, 
      like moisture availability, influence development because eggs are often exposed to 
      prevailing environments in the absence of parental care. Though much research 
      demonstrates the importance of water absorption by eggs, many ecological factors 
      that influence moisture availability in natural nests have received little 
      attention. For example, the type of substrate in which nests are constructed is 
      understudied. We experimentally incubated eggs of the brown anole lizard (Anolis 
      sagrei) in 2 naturally occurring nest substrates that were treated with varying 
      amounts of water to determine how natural substrates influence development at 
      different moisture concentrations. One substrate consisted of sand and crushed 
      seashells and the other was mostly organic material (i.e. decayed plant material). 
      Both are common nesting substrates at our field site. When controlling for water 
      uptake by eggs, we found that egg survival and hatchling phenotypes were similar 
      between substrates; however, embryos developed more quickly in the sand/shell 
      substrate than the organic substrate, indicating substrate-specific effects on 
      embryo physiology. These results demonstrate that different natural substrates can 
      result in similar developmental outcomes if the water available to eggs is 
      comparable; however, some aspects of development, like developmental rate, are 
      affected by the type of substrate, independent of water availability. Further study 
      is required to determine how natural substrates influence embryo physiology 
      independent of water content.

AB  - Local and global changes associated with anthropogenic activities are impacting 
      marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Macroalgae, especially habitat-forming species 
      like kelp, play critical roles in temperate coastal ecosystems. However, their 
      abundance and distribution patterns have been negatively affected by warming in many 
      regions around the globe. Along with global change, coastal ecosystems are also 
      impacted by local drivers such as eutrophication. The interaction between global and 
      local drivers might modulate kelp responses to environmental change. This study 
      examines the regulatory effect of NO(3)(-) on the thermal plasticity of the giant 
      kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. To do this, thermal performance curves (TPCs) of key 
      temperature-dependant traits-growth, photosynthesis, NO(3)(-) assimilation and 
      chlorophyll a fluorescence-were examined under nitrate replete and deplete 
      conditions in a short-term incubation. We found that thermal plasticity was 
      modulated by NO(3)(-) but different thermal responses were observed among traits. 
      Our study reveals that nitrogen, a local driver, modulates kelp responses to high 
      seawater temperatures, ameliorating the negative impacts on physiological 
      performance (i.e. growth and photosynthesis). However, this effect might be 
      species-specific and vary among biogeographic regions - thus, further work is needed 
      to determine the generality of our findings to other key temperate macroalgae that 
      are experiencing temperatures close to their thermal tolerance due to climate 
      change.

TI  - Photosynthesis and Respiration of Baltic Sea Benthic Diatoms to Changing 
      Environmental Conditions and Growth Responses of Selected Species as Affected by an 
      Adjacent Peatland (Hütelmoor).
PG  - 1500
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.01500 [doi]
LID - 1500
AB  - Eight benthic diatom taxa (Actinocyclus octonarius, Melosira moniliformis, 
      Halamphora sp. 1, Halamphora sp. 2, Navicula perminuta, Navicula phyllepta, 
      Nitzschia dubiiformis, Nitzschia pusilla) were isolated from sediments sampled in 
      the southern coastal brackish Baltic Sea and established as unialgal cultures. The 
      coastal shallow water sampling area lies close to a fen peat site (Hütelmoor) and 
      both are connected through an underground peat layer, which might facilitate organic 
      matter and nutrient fluxes along the terrestrial-marine gradient. The photosynthetic 
      performance of these diatoms was measured at different photon fluence rates (0-1200 
      μmol photons m(-2) s(-1), always recorded at 20°C) and different temperatures 
      (5-40°C, always measured at saturating ∼270 μmol photons m(-2) s(-1)), resulting in 
      light saturation points between 32 and 151 μmol photons m(-2) s(-1) and maximum net 
      primary production rates of 23-144 μmol O(2) mg(-1) Chl a h(-1). None of the species 
      showed severe photoinhibition, and hence all displayed a high photo-physiological 
      plasticity. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution and respirational oxygen consumption 
      between 5 and 40°C revealed eurythermal traits for half of the studied taxa as 
      photosynthetic efficiency was at least 20% of the maximum values at the extreme 
      temperatures. The remaining taxa also indicated eurythermal characteristics, 
      however, photosynthetic efficiency of at least 20% was at a narrower temperature 
      range [5 (10) °C to 30 (35) °C]. Species-specific optimum temperatures for 
      photosynthesis (15-30°C) were always lower compared to respiration (25-40°C). 
      Actinocyclus octonarius and Nitzschia dubiiformis were grown in different defined 
      media, some enriched with Hütelmoor water to test for possible effects of organic 
      components. Hütelmoor water media stimulated growth of both diatom species when kept 
      in a light dark cycle. Actinocyclus octonarius particularly grew in darkness in 
      Hütelmoor water media, pointing to heterotrophic capabilities. The benthic diatoms 
      studied are characterized by high photo-physiological plasticity and a broad 
      temperature tolerance to maintain high primary production rates under wide 
      environmental fluctuations. Organic carbon fluxes from the Hütelmoor into the Baltic 
      Sea may support mixo- and/or heterotrophic growth of microphytobenthic communities. 
      These are essential traits for living in a highly dynamic and variable shallow water 
      environment at the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Evaluating the Species Boundaries of Green Microalgae (Coccomyxa, Trebouxiophyceae, 
      Chlorophyta) Using Integrative Taxonomy and DNA Barcoding with Further Implications 
      for the Species Identification in Environmental Samples.
PG  - e0127838
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0127838 [doi]
LID - e0127838
AB  - Integrative taxonomy is an approach for defining species and genera by taking 
      phylogenetic, morphological, physiological, and ecological data into account. This 
      approach is appropriate for microalgae, where morphological convergence and high 
      levels of morphological plasticity complicate the application of the traditional 
      classification. Although DNA barcode markers are well-established for animals, 
      fungi, and higher plants, there is an ongoing discussion about suitable markers for 
      microalgae and protists because these organisms are genetically more diverse 
      compared to the former groups. To solve these problems, we assess the usage of a 
      polyphasic approach combining phenotypic and genetic parameters for species and 
      generic characterization. The application of barcode markers for database queries 
      further allows conclusions about the 'coverage' of culture-based approaches in 
      biodiversity studies and integrates additional aspects into modern taxonomic 
      concepts. Although the culture-dependent approach revealed three new lineages, which 
      are described as new species in this paper, the culture-independent analyses 
      discovered additional putative new species. We evaluated three barcode markers (V4, 
      V9 and ITS-2 regions, nuclear ribosomal operon) and studied the morphological and 
      physiological plasticity of Coccomyxa, which became a model organism because its 
      whole genome sequence has been published. In addition, several biotechnological 
      patents have been registered for Coccomyxa. Coccomyxa representatives are 
      distributed worldwide, are free-living or in symbioses, and colonize terrestrial and 
      aquatic habitats. We investigated more than 40 strains and reviewed the biodiversity 
      and biogeographical distribution of Coccomyxa species using DNA barcoding. The genus 
      Coccomyxa formed a monophyletic group within the Trebouxiophyceae separated into 
      seven independent phylogenetic lineages representing species. Summarizing, the 
      combination of different characteristics in an integrative approach helps to 
      evaluate environmental data and clearly identifies microalgae at generic and species 
      levels.

AB  - Global warming is emerging as one of the most critical threats to terrestrial and 
      marine species worldwide. This study assessed the effects of simulated warming 
      events in culture on two seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, 
      which play a key role in coastal ecosystems of the Mediterranean Sea. Changes in 
      fatty acids as key metabolic indicators were assessed in specimens from two 
      geographical populations of each species adapted to different in situ temperature 
      regimes. Total fatty acid (TFA) content and composition were compared in C. nodosa 
      and P. oceanica from natural populations and following exposure to heat stress in 
      culture. After heat exposure, individuals of C. nodosa and P. oceanica adapted to 
      colder temperatures in situ accumulated significantly more TFA than controls. For 
      both species, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased, and 
      the percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFA) increased significantly after the heat 
      treatment. These results highlight that populations of both species living at 
      warmest temperatures in situ were more thermo-tolerant and exhibited a greater 
      capacity to cope with heat stress by readjusting their lipid composition faster. 
      Finally, exposure of seagrasses to warmer conditions may induce a decrease in 
      PUFA/SFA ratio which could negatively affect their nutritional value and generate 
      important consequences in the healthy state of next trophic levels.

TI  - Effects of admixture in native and invasive populations of Lythrum salicaria.
PG  - 2381-2393
LID - 10.1007/s10530-018-1707-2 [doi]
AB  - Intraspecific hybridization between diverged populations can enhance fitness via 
      various genetic mechanisms. The benefits of such admixture have been proposed to be 
      particularly relevant in biological invasions, when invasive populations originating 
      from different source populations are found sympatrically. However, it remains 
      poorly understood if admixture is an important contributor to plant invasive success 
      and how admixture effects compare between invasive and native ranges. Here, we used 
      experimental crosses in Lythrum salicaria, a species with well-established history 
      of multiple introductions to Eastern North America, to quantify and compare 
      admixture effects in native European and invasive North American populations. We 
      observed heterosis in between-population crosses both in native and invasive ranges. 
      However, invasive-range heterosis was restricted to crosses between two different 
      Eastern and Western invasion fronts, whereas heterosis was absent in geographically 
      distant crosses within a single large invasion front. Our results suggest that 
      multiple introductions have led to already-admixed invasion fronts, such that 
      experimental crosses do not further increase performance, but that contact between 
      different invasion fronts further enhances fitness after admixture. Thus, 
      intra-continental movement of invasive plants in their introduced range has the 
      potential to boost invasiveness even in well-established and successfully spreading 
      invasive species.

AB  - Polyphenisms, where two or more alternative, environmentally-cued phenotypes are 
      produced from the same genotype, arise through variability in the developmental rate 
      and timing of phenotypic traits. Many of these developmental processes are 
      controlled or influenced by endogenous hormones, such as glucocorticoids, which are 
      known to regulate a wide array of vertebrate ontogenetic transitions. Using the mole 
      salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum, as a model, we investigated the role of 
      glucocorticoids in regulating facultative paedomorphosis, an ontogenetic polyphenism 
      where individuals may delay metamorphosis into terrestrial adults. Instead, 
      individuals reproduce as aquatic paedomorphic adults. Paedomorphosis often occurs 
      when aquatic conditions remain favorable, while metamorphosis typically occurs in 
      response to deteriorating or "stressful" aquatic conditions. Since glucocorticoids 
      are central to the vertebrate stress response and are known to play a central role 
      in regulating obligate metamorphosis in amphibians, we hypothesized that they are 
      key regulators of paedomorphic life history strategies. To test this hypothesis, we 
      compared development of larvae in outdoor mesocosms exposed to Low, Medium, and High 
      exogenous doses of corticosterone (CORT). Results revealed that body size and the 
      proportion of paedomorphs were both inversely proportional to exogenous CORT doses 
      and whole-body CORT content. Consistent with known effects of CORT on obligate 
      metamorphosis in amphibians, our results link glucocorticoids to ontogenetic 
      transitions in facultatively paedomorphic salamanders. We discuss our results in the 
      context of theoretical models and the suite of environmental cues known to influence 
      facultative paedomorphosis.

AB  - Fertilizer application is a common anthropogenic alteration to terrestrial systems. 
      Increased nutrient input can impact soil microbial diversity or function directly 
      through altered soil environments, or indirectly through plant-microbe feedbacks, 
      with potentially important effects on ecologically-important plant-associated 
      mutualists. We investigated the impacts of plant fertilizer, containing all common 
      macro and micronutrients on symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia), a group 
      of bacteria that are important for plant productivity and ecosystem function. We 
      collected rhizobia nodule isolates from natural field soil that was treated with 
      slow-release plant fertilizer over a single growing season and compared phenotypic 
      traits related to free-living growth and host partner quality in these isolates to 
      those of rhizobia from unfertilized soils. Through a series of single inoculation 
      assays in controlled glasshouse conditions, we found that isolates from fertilized 
      field soil provided legume hosts with higher mutualistic benefits. Through growth 
      assays on media containing variable plant fertilizer concentrations, we found that 
      plant fertilizer was generally beneficial for rhizobia growth. Rhizobia isolated 
      from fertilized field soil had higher growth rates in the presence of plant 
      fertilizer compared to isolates from unfertilized field soil, indicating that plant 
      fertilizer application favoured rhizobia isolates with higher abilities to utilize 
      fertilizer for free-living growth. We found a positive correlation between growth 
      responses to fertilizer and mutualism benefits among isolates from fertilized field 
      soil, demonstrating that variable plant fertilizer induces context-dependent genetic 
      correlations, potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of either trait 
      through increased trait dependencies. Our study shows that short-term application is 
      sufficient to alter the composition of rhizobia isolates in the population or 
      community, either directly though changes in the soil chemistry or indirectly 
      through altered host legume feedbacks, and is potentially a strong selective agent 
      acting on natural rhizobia populations.

PG  - 1285-1298
LID - 10.1111/nph.16499 [doi]
AB  - Different phosphorus (P)-acquisition strategies may be relevant for species 
      coexistence and plant performance in terrestrial communities on P-deficient soils. 
      However, how interspecific P facilitation functions in natural systems is largely 
      unknown. We investigated the root physiological activities for P mobilization across 
      19 coexisting plant species in steppe vegetation, and then grew plants with various 
      abilities to mobilize sorbed P in a microcosm in a glasshouse. We show that P 
      facilitation mediated by rhizosphere processes of P-mobilizing species promoted 
      growth and increased P content of neighbors in a species-specific manner. When roots 
      interacted with a facilitating neighbor, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Bromus inermis 
      tended to show greater plasticity of root proliferation or rhizosheath acid 
      phosphatase activity compared with other non-P-mobilizing species. Greater variation 
      in these root traits was strongly correlated with increased performance in the 
      presence of a facilitator. The results also show, for the first time, that P 
      facilitation was an important mechanism underlying a positive complementarity 
      effect. Our study highlights that interspecific P-acquisition facilitation requires 
      that facilitated neighbors exhibit a better match of root traits with a facilitating 
      species. It provides a better understanding of species coexistence in P-limited 
      communities.

AB  - Microplastic pollution in global marine environments has attracted significant 
      concerns; however, the environmental factors that influence the distribution and 
      characteristics of microplastics are still unclear. In this study, 100 L of surface 
      seawater samples collected from 16 different stations of the South Yellow Sea in 
      January, April, and August 2018 were analyzed to investigate the relationship 
      between spatio-temporal distribution of microplastics and environment variables. 
      Results showed that the abundance of microplastics in January (6.5 ± 2.1 items/L) 
      was higher than that in April (4.9 ± 2.1 items/L) and August (4.5 ± 1.8 items/L). On 
      the whole, 78% of the total microplastics were <500 μm, ~90% were fibers, 
      73.2%-81.7% were transparent, and the two most abundant polymer types were 
      polyethylene and polypropylene. The highest variability of microplastic 
      characteristics (colour, size, and shape) and composition were observed in August, 
      thereby showing the apparent features of terrestrial sources of microplastic 
      pollution. Principal components analysis distinguished the spatio-temporal 
      distribution of the microplastics, and significant difference in plastic sizes was 
      found between microplastics in January and those in the other two months, which 
      could be attributed to the Yellow Sea Warm Current and/or winter monsoon. 
      Additionally, the abundance of microplastics, especially small-sized microplastics 
      (<500 μm), was positively correlated with seawater salinity. These results suggest 
      that microplastic pollution in surface waters of the South Yellow Sea varies with 
      seasons owing to differences in the terrestrial sources and marine hydrological 
      dynamics.

AB  - As one of the most common and persistent emerging human-made pollutants, 
      microplastics (MPs) have become a global environmental problem. Although many 
      studies have demonstrated the impact of MPs on aquatic organisms, the potential 
      effects on terrestrial fauna are relatively unknown, even though soil is a major 
      sink for plastic pollution. In this study, earthworms (Eisenia fetida) were exposed 
      to MPs from tires (TMPs) in artificial soil at different TMP concentrations (0, 1, 
      5, 10, and 20%, w/w), at different TMP size fractions (2 mm-350 μm; 350 μm-50 μm; 50 
      μm-25 μm; and <25 μm), and time periods (14 and 28 days). The purpose was to 
      evaluate the impact of TMPs on the bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Zn, Cd, and Pb) 
      and levels of oxidative stress in the earthworms. Fluorescence imaging of TMPs 
      stained with Nile red dye clearly showed that the worms had ingested the TMPs, with 
      smaller particles preferentially consumed. The ingested TMPs had altered the surface 
      morphology, degradation that increased surface area and uptake of heavy metals into 
      the organisms. Earthworms exposed to TMPs at the higher concentrations showed clear 
      signs of oxidative stress, with significantly (p < 0.05) increased catalase and 
      peroxidase activity and lipid peroxidation levels, and reduced activity of 
      superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase. SOD, POD, and CAT are important 
      cell protection enzymes that prevent excessive levels of reactive oxygen species in 
      cells. MDA represents the total scavenging ability of free radicals in the tissue. 
      SOD decreases and MDA accumulates rapidly. GST has a detoxification effect. Overall, 
      this study adds to the growing body of evidence that TMPs are harmful to certain 
      terrestrial organisms.

AB  - While there is broad agreement that early hominins practiced some form of 
      terrestrial bipedality, there is also evidence that arboreal behavior remained a 
      part of the locomotor repertoire in some taxa, and that bipedal locomotion may not 
      have been identical to that of modern humans. It has been difficult to evaluate such 
      evidence, however, because of the possibility that early hominins retained primitive 
      traits (such as relatively long upper limbs) of little contemporaneous adaptive 
      significance. Here we examine bone structural properties of the femur and humerus in 
      the Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1 ("Lucy", 3.2 Myr) that are known to be 
      developmentally plastic, and compare them with other early hominins, modern humans, 
      and modern chimpanzees. Cross-sectional images were obtained from micro-CT scans of 
      the original specimens and used to derive section properties of the diaphyses, as 
      well as superior and inferior cortical thicknesses of the femoral neck. A.L. 288-1 
      shows femoral/humeral diaphyseal strength proportions that are intermediate between 
      those of modern humans and chimpanzees, indicating more mechanical loading of the 
      forelimb than in modern humans, and by implication, a significant arboreal locomotor 
      component. Several features of the proximal femur in A.L. 288-1 and other 
      australopiths, including relative femoral head size, distribution of cortical bone 
      in the femoral neck, and cross-sectional shape of the proximal shaft, support the 
      inference of a bipedal gait pattern that differed slightly from that of modern 
      humans, involving more lateral deviation of the body center of mass over the support 
      limb, which would have entailed increased cost of terrestrial locomotion. There is 
      also evidence consistent with increased muscular strength among australopiths in 
      both the forelimb and hind limb, possibly reflecting metabolic trade-offs between 
      muscle and brain development during hominin evolution. Together these findings imply 
      significant differences in both locomotor behavior and ecology between australopiths 
      and later Homo.

AB  - Plastic mulching and straw incorporation are common agricultural practices in China. 
      Plastic mulching is suspected to be a significant source of microplastics in 
      terrestrial environments. Straw incorporation has many effects on the storage of 
      soil organic carbon (SOC) and greenhouse gas emissions, but these effects have not 
      been studied in the presence of microplastic pollution. In this study, 365-day soil 
      incubation experiments were conducted to assess the effects of maize straw and 
      polyethylene microplastics on SOC fractions and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and nitrous 
      oxide (N(2)O) emissions in two different soils (fluvo-aquic and latosol). Against 
      the background of straw incorporation, microplastics reduced the mineralization and 
      decomposition of SOC, resulting in a microbially available SOC content decrease by 
      18.9%. In addition, microplastics were carbon-rich, but relatively stable and 
      difficult to be used by microorganisms, thus increasing the mineral-associated SOC 
      content by 52.5%. This indicated that microplastics had adverse effects on 
      microbially available SOC and positive effects on mineral-associated SOC. 
      Microplastics also decreased coarse particulate SOC (>250 μm), and increased 
      non-aggregated silt and clay aggregated SOC (<53 μm). Furthermore, microplastics 
      changed microbial community compositions, thereby reducing the CO(2) and N(2)O 
      emissions of straw incorporation by 26.5%-33.9% and 35.4%-39.7%, respectively. These 
      results showed that microplastics partially offset the increase of CO(2) and N(2)O 
      emissions induced by straw incorporation. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of 
      microplastics on CO(2) emissions in fluvo-aquic soil was lower than that in latosol 
      soil, whereas the inhibitory effect on N(2)O emissions had the opposite trend.

AB  - Inorganic phosphorous (as phosphate (PO(4)(3-)), is one of the essential nutrients 
      for all living forms, either terrestrial or marine. In oligotrophic seawaters, this 
      macronutrient is limited (10(-9) M) and its ratio with other elements (nitrogen or 
      carbon) is denoting the health state of the marine environment; a small variation of 
      its concentration can produce eutrophication. The gold standard method used for 
      PO(4)(3-) detection is based on colorimetric detection of phosphomolybdate. The 
      colored complex is obtained by mixing water-soluble molybdenum salts (Mo(VI)) and 
      reducing agents in acid media, along with the sample containing PO(4)(3-). Moreover, 
      the kinetic of complex formation is slow, about 1 h is generally required for color 
      to develop, exposing the assay to the drawbacks of interferences as those from 
      silica. The detection is preferably performed in a controlled environment (i.e. in a 
      laboratory) because several chemicals and steps of preparations are required as well 
      as the optical instrumentation is not intended for in-field use. Electrochemical 
      sensors offer portability and simplicity making them a practical option for on-site 
      detection applications. To gain an analytical alternative in measuring low 
      quantities of PO(4)(3-) (10(-9) M), and overcome some of the drawbacks of the 
      classical approaches, we optimised a new easy way to produce a plastic electrode 
      decorated with an alkyl Mo-polyoxometalate (Mo(8)O(26)(4-)), that is soluble in 
      organic solvents. This tetra-butyl-ammonium octamolybdate powder, [N (C4H9)4]4 
      Mo8O26, purposely synthetized was identified with FTIR, Raman, MS methods, and the 
      electroactivity and reactivity with PO(4)(3-) was confirmed in solution with cyclic 
      voltammetry (CV). When the Mo-decorated electrode was in contact with PO(4)(3-), an 
      electroactive phosphomolybdate aggregate formed at the electrode surface that was 
      electrochemically detectable with square wave voltammetry (SWV). A remarkably low 
      detection limit of 6.1 nM, to PO(4)(3-), as well as good stability and selectivity 
      were obtained also in real samples. In fact, PO(4)(3-) was measured in saline 
      simulated and real seawater samples at nM concentrations in less than 5 min. The 
      present investigation provides a new alternative to the current standard 
      colorimetric methods to detect low phosphate concentrations, showing the potential 
      to be used for monitoring nutrients in oligotrophic seawater.

AB  - Body size at maturity often varies with environmental conditions, as well as between 
      males and females within a species [termed Sexual Size Dimorphism (SSD)]. Variation 
      in body size clines between the sexes can determine the degree to which SSD varies 
      across environmental gradients. We use a meta-analytic approach to investigate 
      whether major biogeographical and temporal (intra-annually across seasons) body size 
      clines differ systematically between the sexes in arthropods. We consider 329 
      intra-specific environmental gradients in adult body size across latitude, altitude 
      and with seasonal temperature variation, representing 126 arthropod species from 16 
      taxonomic orders. On average, we observe greater variability in male than female 
      body size across latitude, consistent with the hypothesis that, over evolutionary 
      time, directional selection has acted more strongly on male than female size. In 
      contrast, neither sex exhibits consistently greater proportional changes in body 
      size than the other sex across altitudinal or seasonal gradients, akin to earlier 
      findings for plastic temperature-size responses measured in the laboratory. 
      Variation in the degree to which body size gradients differ between the sexes cannot 
      be explained by a range of potentially influential factors, including environment 
      type (aquatic vs. terrestrial), voltinism, mean species' body size, degree of SSD, 
      or gradient direction. Ultimately, if we are to make better sense of the patterns 
      (or lack thereof) in SSD across environmental gradients, we require a more detailed 
      understanding of the underlying selective pressures driving clines in body size. 
      Such understanding will provide a more comprehensive hypothesis-driven approach to 
      explaining biogeographical and temporal variation in SSD.

AB  - Microplastics are observed ubiquitously and in different environmental compartments

      including biota. Over the last decade, several methods have been applied and 
      advanced to monitor and quantify microplastics, to identify the polymer material and 
      to describe the particle properties, such as size, shape or colour. In most cases, 
      the overarching aim is to elucidate patterns of occurrence that might result from 
      (micro)plastic emissions and environmental fate. But the applied methods are subject 
      to uncertainties and boundary conditions, be it spatial resolution that excludes the 
      smallest microplastics or limitations in distinguishing microplastic particles from 
      natural particles. This critical review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art 
      procedures in microplastic analysis, gives examples of potential ways ahead and 
      remaining challenges and classifies available methods according to the underlying 
      research question. The resulting decision tree for the selection of analytical 
      methods starts with a common research question and takes specificities of the 
      environmental matrix into account. The procedural range consequently ranges from 
      fast screening methods based on visual identification to a highly sophisticated 
      combination of analytical methods that provide information on polymer type, particle 
      number or mass and eventually particle size but are very time-consuming and 
      expensive. Standardization of microplastic analytical methods on the basis of the 
      research aim will help to make study results comparable and obtain a more 
      comprehensive picture of microplastic abundance and fate in the environment.

AB  - Although few indicators of time since death for corpses found in aquatic ecosystems 
      are comparable in precision to the insect indicators used in terrestrial cases, 
      there are observations that can be useful in suggesting or ruling out an approximate 
      PMSI (postmortem submersion interval). For example, the time intervals required for 
      certain growth phases of aquatic insects, such as caddisflies, that may attach 
      themselves to the submerged remains can be used to estimate a minimum PMSI. 
      Approximately 8 of the 13 orders of insects containing species with aquatic or 
      semi-aquatic stages are likely to be associated with carrion or corpses in aquatic 
      habitats. We present a case study in which portions of a body from an adult male 
      were discovered in a south central Michigan stream. The body was dismembered and 
      portions were recovered from two bags floating and submerged in the stream. Insect 
      specimens collected from mesh and plastic bags consisted of one fly larva belonging 
      to the family Muscidae, and caddisfly larvae belonging to two families: the 
      Limnephilidae. (case-makers) and the Hydropsychidae, (net spinners). We used unique 
      case-building behaviors of the limnephilid caddisflies found on the remains to 
      elucidate a PMSI range consistent with the disappearance of the victim. It is 
      important for forensic investigators to understand that although some precision is 
      lost in estimating a PMSI with aquatic insects, these organisms should not be 
      ignored in gathering evidence from aquatic crime scenes, and in fact, they can 
      provide valuable details in estimating a PMSI.

TI  - A global mass budget for positively buoyant macroplastic debris in the ocean.
PG  - 12922

LID - 12922
AB  - Predicted global figures for plastic debris accumulation in the ocean surface layer 
      range on the order of hundreds of thousands of metric tons, representing only a few 
      percent of estimated annual emissions into the marine environment. The current 
      accepted explanation for this difference is that positively buoyant macroplastic 
      objects do not persist on the ocean surface. Subject to degradation into 
      microplastics, the major part of the mass is predicted to have settled below the 
      surface. However, we argue that such a simple emission-degradation model cannot 
      explain the occurrence of decades-old objects collected by oceanic expeditions. We 
      show that debris circulation dynamics in coastal environments may be a better 
      explanation for this difference. The results presented here suggest that there is a 
      significant time interval, on the order of several years to decades, between 
      terrestrial emissions and representative accumulation in offshore waters. 
      Importantly, our results also indicate that the current generation of secondary 
      microplastics in the global ocean is mostly a result of the degradation of objects 
      produced in the 1990s and earlier. Finally, we propose a series of future emission 
      scenarios until 2050, discussing the necessity to rapidly reduce emissions and 
      actively remove waste accumulated in the environment to mitigate further 
      microplastic contamination in the global ocean.

AB  - The authors present their experience of surgery in weightlessness conditions. 
      Russians and Americans already focused on that subject but two questions were still 
      unsolved: what was the limit of human skill in these extreme conditions and was it 
      possible to operate a human under total safety? Between 2003 and 2007, using a 0G 
      plane for our experiment, we focused on two goals: firstly, the conception of a 
      microsurgical module to test complex microsurgical procedures in rats and secondly, 
      the construction of a surgical workstation with specific air filtration device and 
      define surgical and anaesthetic protocols to carry on a surgery in man. In September 
      2003, we succeeded to perform the microscopic report of a 0,5mm artery (which is the 
      smallest we can suture in terrestrial conditions) by using seven stitches of 10 x 0 
      monofilament suture. The 27th of September 2007, we removed a lipoma from the 
      forearm of a 47-year-old man. These experiments take place in a wide program of 
      development of telesurgery controlled through satellite transmission with all 
      forthcoming civil, military and humanitarian applications.

TI  - An overview of the genome of Nostoc punctiforme, a multicellular, symbiotic 
      cyanobacterium.
PG  - 85-106
AB  - Nostoc punctiforme is a filamentous cyanobacterium with extensive phenotypic 
      characteristics and a relatively large genome, approaching 10 Mb. The phenotypic 
      characteristics include a photoautotrophic, diazotrophic mode of growth, but N. 
      punctiforme is also facultatively heterotrophic; its vegetative cells have multiple 
      developmental alternatives, including terminal differentiation into nitrogen-fixing 
      heterocysts and transient differentiation into spore-like akinetes or motile 
      filaments called hormogonia; and N. punctiforme has broad symbiotic competence with 
      fungi and terrestrial plants, including bryophytes, gymnosperms and an angiosperm. 
      The shotgun-sequencing phase of the N. punctiforme strain ATCC 29133 genome has been 
      completed by the Joint Genome Institute. Annotation of an 8.9 Mb database yielded 
      7432 open reading frames, 45% of which encode proteins with known or probable known 
      function and 29% of which are unique to N. punctiforme. Comparative analysis of the 
      sequence indicates a genome that is highly plastic and in a state of flux, with 
      numerous insertion sequences and multilocus repeats, as well as genes encoding 
      transposases and DNA modification enzymes. The sequence also reveals the presence of 
      genes encoding putative proteins that collectively define almost all characteristics 
      of cyanobacteria as a group. N. punctiforme has an extensive potential to sense and 
      respond to environmental signals as reflected by the presence of more than 400 genes 
      encoding sensor protein kinases, response regulators and other transcriptional 
      factors. The signal transduction systems and any of the large number of unique genes 
      may play essential roles in the cell differentiation and symbiotic interaction 
      properties of N. punctiforme.

TI  - Effects of soil particles and convective transport on dispersion and aggregation of 
      nanoplastics via small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and ultra SANS (USANS).
PG  - e0235893
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0235893 [doi]
LID - e0235893
AB  - Terrestrial nanoplastics (NPs) pose a serious threat to agricultural food production 
      systems due to the potential harm of soil-born micro- and macroorganisms that 
      promote soil fertility and ability of NPs to adsorb onto and penetrate into 
      vegetables and other crops. Very little is known about the dispersion, fate and 
      transport of NPs in soils. This is because of the challenges of analyzing 
      terrestrial NPs by conventional microscopic techniques due to the low concentrations 
      of NPs and absence of optical transparency in these systems. Herein, we investigate 
      the potential utility of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and Ultra SANS 
      (USANS) to probe the agglomeration behavior of NPs prepared from polybutyrate 
      adipate terephthalate, a prominent biodegradable plastic used in agricultural 
      mulching, in the presence of vermiculite, an artificial soil. SANS with the contrast 
      matching technique was used to study the aggregation of NPs co-dispersed with 
      vermiculite in aqueous media. We determined the contrast match point for vermiculite 
      was 66% D2O / 33% H2O. At this condition, the signal for vermiculite was 
      ~50-100%-fold lower that obtained using neat H2O or D2O as solvent. According to 
      SANS and USANS, smaller-sized NPs (50 nm) remained dispersed in water and did not 
      undergo size reduction or self-agglomeration, nor formed agglomerates with 
      vermiculite. Larger-sized NPs (300-1000 nm) formed self-agglomerates and 
      agglomerates with vermiculite, demonstrating their significant adhesion with soil. 
      However, employment of convective transport (simulated by ex situ stirring of the 
      slurries prior to SANS and USANS analyses) reduced the self-agglomeration, 
      demonstrating weak NP-NP interactions. Convective transport also led to size 
      reduction of the larger-sized NPs. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential 
      utility of SANS and USANS with contrast matching technique for investigating 
      behavior of terrestrial NPs in complex soil systems.

      evolved amongst nematodes may, in part, be due to a feature of nematode development 
      acting as a pre-adaptation for the transition from a free-living to a parasitic life 
      history. One candidate pre-adaptive feature for evolution in terrestrial nematodes 
      is the dauer larva, a developmentally arrested morph formed in response to 
      environmental signals. RESULTS: We investigated the role of dauer development in the 
      nematode, Parastrongyloides trichosuri, which has retained a complete free-living 
      life cycle in addition to a life cycle as a mammalian gastrointestinal parasite. We 
      show that the developmental switch between these life histories is sensitive to the 
      same environmental cues as dauer arrest in free-living nematodes, including 
      sensitivity to a chemical cue produced by the free-living stages. Furthermore, we 
      show that genetic variation for the sensitivity of the cue(s) exists in natural 
      populations of P. trichosuri, such that we derived inbred lines that were largely 
      insensitive to the cue and other lines that were supersensitive to the cue. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For this parasitic clade, and perhaps more widely in the phylum, the 
      evolution of parasitism co-opted the dauer switch of a free-living ancestor. This 
      lends direct support to the hypothesis that the switch to developmental arrest in 
      the dauer larva acted as a pre-adaptation for the evolution of parasitism, and 
      suggests that the sensory transduction machinery downstream of the cue may have been 
      similarly co-opted and modified.

TI  - An exploratory study on the combined effects of external and internal morphology on 
      load dissipation in primate capitates: its potential for an understanding of the 
      positional and locomotor repertoire of early hominins.
PG  - 292-304
LID - 10.1159/000322631 [doi]
AB  - This pilot study explored whether the redirection of stress through trabeculae 
      within morphologically constrained capitates provides information about 
      habitual/positional behaviours unavailable from the study of external morphology 
      alone. To assess this possibility, an experimental finite element approach was 
      taken, whereby no attempt was made to reconstruct the actual magnitudes and loading 
      conditions experienced by the capitates in vivo. Rather, this work addressed 
      fundamental biological questions relating to bone plasticity, i.e. internal versus 
      external bone morphology. The capitates of 7 species with different and - in the 
      case of fossils - inferred locomotor behaviours were selected. Virtual models of 
      capitates were created, scaled to the same size and subjected to the same 
      theoretical load. In the first set of analyses, models were assigned the material 
      properties of bone throughout, whereas in the second set, models were assigned 11 
      different material properties representing the trabecular architecture derived from 
      high-resolution CT. Species with arboreal behaviours consistently redirected loads 
      towards the ulnar aspect of the capitate when trabeculae were introduced, while 
      terrestrial species, and the bipedal Homo, redirected stress towards the radial 
      side. From these preliminary analyses, it is tentatively concluded that 
      Australopithecus anamensis habitually engaged in arboreal behaviours, whereas 
      Australopithecus afarensis did not.

TI  - Iron necessity: the secret of Wolbachia's success?
PG  - e3224
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003224 [doi]
LID - e3224
AB  - The bacterium Wolbachia (order Rickettsiales) is probably the world's most 
      successful vertically-transmitted symbiont, distributed among a staggering 40% of 
      terrestrial arthropod species. Wolbachia has great potential in vector control due 
      to its ability to manipulate its hosts' reproduction and to impede the replication 
      and dissemination of arboviruses and other pathogens within haematophagous 
      arthropods. In addition, the unexpected presence of Wolbachia in filarial nematodes 
      of medical and veterinary importance has provided an opportunity to target the adult 
      worms of Wuchereria bancrofti, Onchocerca volvulus, and Dirofilaria immitis with 
      safe drugs such as doxycycline. A striking feature of Wolbachia is its phenotypic 
      plasticity between (and sometimes within) hosts, which may be underpinned by its 
      ability to integrate itself into several key processes within eukaryotic cells: 
      oxidative stress, autophagy, and apoptosis. Importantly, despite significant 
      differences in the genomes of arthropod and filarial Wolbachia strains, these 
      nexuses appear to lie on a continuum in different hosts. Here, we consider how iron 
      metabolism may represent a fundamental aspect of host homeostasis that is impacted 
      by Wolbachia infection, connecting disparate pathways ranging from the provision of 
      haem and ATP to programmed cell death, aging, and the recycling of intracellular 
      resources. Depending on how Wolbachia and host cells interact across networks that 
      depend on iron, the gradient between parasitism and mutualism may shift dynamically 
      in some systems, or alternatively, stabilise on one or the other end of the 
      spectrum.

AB  - Silicon (Si) plays a critical role in plant functional ecology, protecting plants 
      from multiple environmental stressors. While all terrestrial plants contain some Si, 
      wetland grasses are frequently found to have the highest concentrations, although 
      the mechanisms driving Si accumulation in wetland grasses remain in large part 
      uncertain. For example, active Si accumulation is often assumed to be responsible 
      for elevated Si concentrations found in wetland grasses. However, life stage and 
      differences in Si availability in the surrounding environment also appear to be 
      important variables controlling the Si concentrations of wetland grasses. Here we 
      used original data from five North American salt marshes, as well as all known 
      published literature values, to examine the primary drivers of Si accumulation in 
      Spartina, a genus of prolific salt marsh grasses found worldwide. We found evidence 
      of multiple modes of Si accumulation in Spartina, with passive accumulation observed 
      in non-degraded marshes where Spartina was native, while rejective accumulation was 
      found in regions where Spartina was invasive. Evidence of active accumulation was 
      found in only one marsh where Spartina was native, but was also subjected to 
      nutrient over-enrichment. We developed a conceptual model which hypothesizes that 
      the mode of Si uptake by Spartina is dependent on local environmental factors and 
      genetic origin, supporting the idea that plant species should be placed along a 
      spectrum of Si accumulation. We hypothesize that Spartina exhibits previously 
      unrecognized phenotypic plasticity with regard to Si accumulation, allowing these 
      plants to respond to changes in marsh condition. These results provide new insight 
      regarding how salt marsh ecosystems regulate Si exchange at the land-sea interface.

TI  - New perspectives on brachiation mechanics.
PG  - 100-17
AB  - This review is designed to evaluate and interpret studies relevant to the locomotory 
      mode known as brachiation, particularly as performed by the Hylobatid apes: the 
      gibbon and siamang species. The older literature and its conclusions are evaluated 
      against recent work performed by the author and other research groups working on 
      brachiation models, either computer simulations or physical robots. The gibbon 
      displays two types of brachiation: continuous contact, analogous to walking, and 
      ricochetal, analogous to running. Both brachiation gaits display substantial 
      pendular exchange between kinetic and potential energy. However, the fundamental 
      feature of either of these gaits is the minimization of collisional energy loss. 
      Collisional energy loss due to discontinuities in the trajectory of the center of 
      mass is emerging as key in understanding locomotion using limbs in any terrestrial 
      environment. The insight gained from this perspective applied to gibbon locomotion 
      demonstrates that this is a critical factor in understanding many of the maneuvers 
      employed by these animals, and can provide novel new interpretations of the 
      morphological specializations that characterize the group. It is observed that these 
      animals could brachiate using either totally active (muscle powered) or totally 
      passive (nonmuscular) mechanisms. The active option would be metabolically costly, 
      but provides substantial motion plasticity, while the passive option has the 
      potential for profound economy, but does not allow a means to effectively contend 
      with the inconsistencies present in the animal's natural environment. The conclusion 
      is that the body form of brachiators and the locomotion behaviors they exhibit are a 
      compromise between these two extremes, and these features of the gibbon's biology 
      can only be understood by recognizing the role of collisional energy loss and 
      evaluating both passive and active motion options together.

LID - 10.1016/j.pedobi.2017.11.001 [doi]
AB  - Global change alters the composition and functioning of ecosystems by creating novel 
      environmental conditions and thereby selecting for specific traits of organisms. 
      Thus, trait-based approaches are promising tools to more mechanistically understand 
      compositional and functional shifts in ecological communities as well as the 
      dependency of response and effect traits upon global change. Such approaches have 
      been particularly successful for the study of plant communities in terrestrial 
      ecosystems. However, given the intimate linkages between aboveground and belowground 
      compartments as well as the significance of plants as integrating organisms across 
      those compartments, the role of plant traits in affecting soils communities has been 
      understudied. This special issue contains empirical studies and reviews of plant 
      trait effects on soil organisms and functions. Based on those contributions, we 
      discuss here plasticity in trait expression, the context-dependency of plant trait 
      effects, time lags in soil biotic responses to trait expression, and limitations of 
      measured plant traits. We conclude that plant trait-based approaches are an 
      important tool to advance soil ecological research, but also identify critical 
      limitations and next steps.

TI  - Urban Evolutionary Ecology and the Potential Benefits of Implementing Genomics.
PG  - 138-151
LID - 10.1093/jhered/esy001 [doi]
AB  - Urban habitats are quickly becoming exceptional models to address adaptation under 
      rapid environmental change, given the expansive temporal and spatial scales with 
      which anthropogenic landscape conversion occurs. Urban ecologists in the last 10-15 
      years have done an extraordinary job of highlighting phenotypic patterns that 
      correspond with urban living, as well as delineating urban population structure 
      using traditional genetic markers. The underpinning genetic mechanisms that govern 
      those phenotypic patterns, however, are less well established. Moreover, the power 
      of traditional molecular studies is constrained by the number of markers being 
      evaluated, which limits the potential to assess fine-scale population structure 
      potentially common in urban areas. With the recent proliferation of low-cost, 
      high-throughput sequencing methods, we can begin to address an emerging question in 
      urban ecology: are species adapted to local optima within cities or are they 
      expressing latent phenotypic plasticity? Here, I provide a comprehensive review of 
      previous urban ecological studies, with special focus on the molecular ecology and 
      phenotypic adjustments documented in urban terrestrial and amphibious fauna. I 
      subsequently pinpoint areas in the literature that could benefit from a genomic 
      investigation and briefly discuss the suitability of specific techniques in 
      addressing eco-evolutionary questions within urban ecology. Though many challenges 
      exist with implementing genomics into urban ecology, such studies provide an 
      exceptional opportunity to advance our understanding of eco-evolutionary processes 
      in metropolitan areas.

AB  - From an evolutionary perspective, the emergence of the sophisticated chemical 
      scaffolds of flavonoid molecules represents a key step in the colonization of 
      Earth's terrestrial environment by vascular plants nearly 500 million years ago. The 
      subsequent evolution of flavonoids through recruitment and modification of ancestors 
      involved in primary metabolism has allowed vascular plants to cope with pathogen 
      invasion and damaging UV light. The functional properties of flavonoids as a unique 
      combination of different classes of compounds vary significantly depending on the 
      demands of their local real estate. Apart from geographical location, the 
      composition of flavonoids is largely dependent on the plant species, their 
      developmental stage, tissue type, subcellular localization, and key ecological 
      influences of both biotic and abiotic origin. Molecular and metabolic cross-talk 
      between flavonoid and other pathways as a result of the re-direction of intermediate 
      molecules have been well investigated. This metabolic plasticity is a key factor in 
      plant adaptive strength and is of paramount importance for early land plants 
      adaptation to their local ecosystems. In human and animal health the biological and 
      pharmacological activities of flavonoids have been investigated in great depth and 
      have shown a wide range of anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, and 
      anti-cancer properties. In this paper we review the application of advanced gene 
      technologies for targeted reprogramming of the flavonoid pathway in plants to 
      understand its molecular functions and explore opportunities for major improvements 
      in forage plants enhancing animal health and production.

TI  - Thermal acclimation in a complex life cycle: the effects of larval and adult thermal 
      conditions on metabolic rate and heat resistance in Culex pipiens (Diptera: 
      Culicidae).

AB  - It has now been well established that insects can respond to variation in their 
      environment via acclimation, yet the extent of the response varies among populations 
      and environmental characteristics. One under-investigated theme which may contribute 
      to this variation concerns acclimation effects across the life cycle. The present 
      study explores how acclimation in the larval stage of Culex pipiens affects thermal 
      relations in the adult stage. Mosquitoes were reared in a full factorial design at 
      18 or 26 °C as larvae and adults, then critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and metabolic 
      rate-temperature relationships (MR-T) were determined for all 4 treatments. CTmax 
      was positively affected by both larval and adult acclimation treatments. MR-T slope 
      was significantly affected only by adult treatment: warm acclimated adults had on 
      average shallower slopes and higher y-intercepts than cool acclimated ones. These 
      results demonstrate that larval acclimation effects can alter adult phenotypes in a 
      species whose life cycle includes two drastically different environments, an aquatic 
      and a terrestrial stage. Studying insects with complex life cycles, especially those 
      with aquatic or subterranean larval stages, can provide valuable information on the 
      effects of thermal variability and predictability on phenotypic plasticity.

TI  - Local adaptation in adult feeding preference and juvenile performance in the 
      generalist herbivore Idotea balthica.
PG  - 383-93
LID - 10.1007/s00442-012-2302-3 [doi]
AB  - Populations can respond to environmental heterogeneity by genetic adaptation to 
      local conditions. Evidence for local adaptation in herbivores with relatively broad 
      host breadth is scarce, either because generalists rarely locally adapt or because 
      fewer studies have tested for local adaptation. The marine isopod Idotea balthica, a 
      small (<3 cm) generalist herbivore common to estuaries of the northwestern Atlantic, 
      is found on multiple macroalgae and sea grasses north of 42°N, while more southerly 
      populations utilize sea grass-dominated and macroalgal-poor habitats. Feeding 
      preference assays revealed a latitudinal shift in preference hierarchy that mirrors 
      this geographic variation in host availability. Northern populations have higher 
      feeding preference for fresh and freeze-dried tissue of the brown macroalga Fucus 
      vesiculosus and consumed more of its water-soluble and lipophilic extracts relative 
      to southern populations. In contrast, southern populations have a relatively higher 
      preference for the green macroalga Ulva linza and sea grass Zostera marina. The rank 
      of hosts in feeding assays exhibited by northern adults (Fucus = Ulva > Zostera) and 
      southern adults (Ulva > Fucus > Zostera) closely mirrored ranking of juvenile growth 
      rates, suggesting that preference and performance are strongly correlated across 
      these macrophytes. Several of our assays included isopods that had parents reared 
      under uniform laboratory conditions, indicating that geographic differences are 
      genetically mediated and unlikely to reflect phenotypic plasticity or maternal 
      effects. Local adaptation in host use traits may be common in broadly distributed, 
      generalist herbivores in marine and terrestrial systems, and will manifest itself as 
      local shifts in the preference ranking of hosts.

TI  - The occurrence of crassulacean acid metabolism in Cymbidium (Orchidaceae) and its 
      ecological and evolutionary implications.
PG  - 163-77
LID - 10.1007/s10265-007-0144-6 [doi]
AB  - Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is one of the photosynthetic pathways regarded as 
      adaptations to water stress in land plants. Little is known about correlations among 
      the level of CAM activity, environment of habitat, life form, and phylogenetic 
      relationship of a plant group from an evolutionary perspective. We examined these 
      relationships in 18 species of Cymbidium (Orchidaceae) because the genus shows 
      distinctive diversification of habitats and life forms. The photosynthetic type was 
      classed into three categories, strong CAM, weak CAM, and C(3) on the basis of CAM 
      activity. CAM expression in Cymbidium was confined to the epiphytic and lithophytic 
      species. Especially, all of these species from tropical to subtropical rainforest 
      exhibited CAM activity. On the other hand, the terrestrial species always exhibited 
      C(3) metabolism irrespective of their varied habitats. Regarding the evolution of 
      photosynthetic characters, weak CAM was the ancestral state in Cymbidium and strong 
      CAM and C(3) metabolism occurred subsequently. The evolution of strong CAM likely 
      enabled Cymbidium to extend to exposed sites in tropical lowland where marked water 
      stress exists. Further, different levels of CAM activity characterized each species 
      and such potential plasticity of CAM may realize the radiation of Cymbidium into 
      sites with different environmental conditions.

TI  - The Terrestrial Carnivorous Plant Utricularia reniformis Sheds Light on 
      Environmental and Life-Form Genome Plasticity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21010003 [doi]
LID - 3
AB  - Utricularia belongs to Lentibulariaceae, a widespread family of carnivorous plants 
      that possess ultra-small and highly dynamic nuclear genomes. It has been shown that 
      the Lentibulariaceae genomes have been shaped by transposable elements expansion and 
      loss, and multiple rounds of whole-genome duplications (WGD), making the family a 
      platform for evolutionary and comparative genomics studies. To explore the evolution 
      of Utricularia, we estimated the chromosome number and genome size, as well as 
      sequenced the terrestrial bladderwort Utricularia reniformis (2n = 40, 1C = 
      317.1-Mpb). Here, we report a high quality 304 Mb draft genome, with a scaffold NG50 
      of 466-Kb, a BUSCO completeness of 87.8%, and 42,582 predicted genes. Compared to 
      the smaller and aquatic U. gibba genome (101 Mb) that has a 32% repetitive sequence, 
      the U. reniformis genome is highly repetitive (56%). The structural differences 
      between the two genomes are the result of distinct fractionation and rearrangements 
      after WGD, and massive proliferation of LTR-retrotransposons. Moreover, GO 
      enrichment analyses suggest an ongoing gene birth-death-innovation process occurring 
      among the tandem duplicated genes, shaping the evolution of carnivory-associated 
      functions. We also identified unique patterns of developmentally related genes that 
      support the terrestrial life-form and body plan of U. reniformis. Collectively, our 
      results provided additional insights into the evolution of the plastic and 
      specialized Lentibulariaceae genomes.

AB  - Subtropical gyres are the oceanic regions where plastic litter accumulates over long 
      timescales, exposing surrounding oceanic islands to plastic contamination, with 
      potentially severe consequences on marine life. Islands' exposure to such 
      contaminants, littered over long distances in marine or terrestrial habitats, is due 
      to the ocean currents that can transport plastic over long ranges. Here, this issue 
      is addressed for the Easter Island ecoregion (EIE). High-resolution ocean 
      circulation models are used with a Lagrangian particle-tracking tool to identify the 
      connectivity patterns of the EIE with industrial fishing areas and coastline regions 
      of the Pacific basin. Connectivity patterns for "virtual" particles either floating 
      (such as buoyant macroplastics) or neutrally-buoyant (smaller microplastics) are 
      investigated. We find that the South American shoreline between 20°S and 40°S, and 
      the fishing zone within international waters off Peru (20°S, 80°W) are associated 
      with the highest probability for debris to reach the EIE, with transit times under 2 
      years. These regions coincide with the most-densely populated coastal region of 
      Chile and the most-intensely fished region in the South Pacific. The findings offer 
      potential for mitigating plastic contamination reaching the EIE through better 
      upstream waste management. Results also highlight the need for international action 
      plans on this important issue.

AB  - The spraying of coca (Erythroxylum coca) with glyphosate (coca mixture, a 
      combination of formulated glyphosate, Glyphos, and an adjuvant, Cosmo-Flux) in 
      Colombia has raised concerns about possible impacts on amphibians. Although acute 
      LC50 for 8 species of Colombian frogs ranged from 1.2 to 2.78 mg acid equivalents 
      (a.e.)/L, these exposures were conducted in the laboratory in the absence of 
      sediments and organic matter such as would occur under realistic field conditions. 
      In order to assess the effects of overspray of frog habitat under field conditions, 
      Gosner stage 25 tadpoles of Rhinella granulosa, R. marina, Hypsiboas crepitans, and 
      Scinax ruber were placed in outdoor microcosms made from polyethylene plastic fish 
      ponds (2.07 m in diameter, 37 cm high) in an experimental area in Tolima, Colombia. 
      The bottoms of the microcosms were covered with a 3-cm layer of local soil and they 
      were filled to a depth of 15 cm (above the sediment) with local spring water. After 
      up to 100 tadpoles of each frog species were placed in the microcosms, they were 
      sprayed with the coca mixture at concentrations greater and less than the normal 
      application rate (3.69 kg glyphosate a.e./ha). Mortality at 96 h in the control 
      microcosms was between 0 and 16% and LC50 values were between 8.9 and 10.9 kg 
      glyphosate a.e./ha (equivalent to initial concentrations of 5963 to 7303 microg 
      glyphosate a.e./L). Mortality >LC50 was only observed in the tested species when the 
      application rate was >2-fold the normal application rate. In other experiments, 
      juvenile and adult terrestrial stages of frogs were exposed by direct spraying to a 
      range of concentrations of coca mixture. Juveniles and adults were exposed in 
      plastic food containers (19 x 19 cm). The bottom of the container was filled with 
      moistened soil and leaf litter to a depth of 1 cm and 0.5 cm, respectively. 
      Mortality in the controls was low, from 0 to 10%, and from 0 to 35% at the normal 
      application rate. LC50 values ranged between 4.5 kg a.e./ha and 22.8 kg a.e./ha, 
      1.5- to 6-fold greater than the normal application rate. Data indicate that, under 
      realistic worst-case exposure conditions, the mixture of Glyphos and Cosmo-Flux as 
      used for control of coca in Colombia exerts a low toxicity to aquatic and 
      terrestrial stages of anurans and that risks to these organisms under field 
      conditions are small.

TI  - Shrinking body sizes in response to warming: explanations for the temperature-size 
      rule with special emphasis on the role of oxygen.
PG  - 247-268
LID - 10.1111/brv.12653 [doi]
AB  - Body size is central to ecology at levels ranging from organismal fecundity to the 
      functioning of communities and ecosystems. Understanding temperature-induced 
      variations in body size is therefore of fundamental and applied interest, yet 
      thermal responses of body size remain poorly understood. Temperature-size (T-S) 
      responses tend to be negative (e.g. smaller body size at maturity when reared under 
      warmer conditions), which has been termed the temperature-size rule (TSR). 
      Explanations emphasize either physiological mechanisms (e.g. limitation of oxygen or 
      other resources and temperature-dependent resource allocation) or the adaptive value 
      of either a large body size (e.g. to increase fecundity) or a short development time 
      (e.g. in response to increased mortality in warm conditions). Oxygen limitation 
      could act as a proximate factor, but we suggest it more likely constitutes a 
      selective pressure to reduce body size in the warm: risks of oxygen limitation will 
      be reduced as a consequence of evolution eliminating genotypes more prone to oxygen 
      limitation. Thus, T-S responses can be explained by the 'Ghost of Oxygen-limitation 
      Past', whereby the resulting (evolved) T-S responses safeguard sufficient oxygen 
      provisioning under warmer conditions, reflecting the balance between oxygen supply 
      and demands experienced by ancestors. T-S responses vary considerably across 
      species, but some of this variation is predictable. Body-size reductions with 
      warming are stronger in aquatic taxa than in terrestrial taxa. We discuss whether 
      larger aquatic taxa may especially face greater risks of oxygen limitation as they 
      grow, which may be manifested at the cellular level, the level of the gills and the 
      whole-organism level. In contrast to aquatic species, terrestrial ectotherms may be 
      less prone to oxygen limitation and prioritize early maturity over large size, 
      likely because overwintering is more challenging, with concomitant stronger end-of 
      season time constraints. Mechanisms related to time constraints and oxygen 
      limitation are not mutually exclusive explanations for the TSR. Rather, these and 
      other mechanisms may operate in tandem. But their relative importance may vary 
      depending on the ecology and physiology of the species in question, explaining not 
      only the general tendency of negative T-S responses but also variation in T-S 
      responses among animals differing in mode of respiration (e.g. water breathers 
      versus air breathers), genome size, voltinism and thermally associated behaviour 
      (e.g. heliotherms).

AB  - In the present study, we investigated microplastics (MPs) in agricultural soils with 
      different agronomic practices (organic farming, soil under greenhouses, soil under 
      mulching and soil irrigated with treated wastewater (TWW)). Plastic particles from 
      each site were collected and characterized by FTIR and Raman microspectroscopy. 
      Plastic particles were then ground and added (size rage under 100 μm) at a 
      concentration of 100 μg kg(-1) to soils from organic farming containing Eisenia 
      andrei for 7 and 14 days. MPs accumulation in earthworms was quantified and 
      characterized. Oxidative stress was assessed by evaluating the activities of 
      catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, and acetylcholinesterase as well as 
      malondialdehyde accumulation. Our results revealed higher quantity of MPs in soils 
      ranging from 13.21 ± 0.89 to 852.24 ± 124.2 items kg(-1) with the dominance of small 
      sizes (0.22-1.22 μm). Polyethylene (PE) and polybutyrate adipate terephtalate (PBAT) 
      were the dominant MPs. Moreover, our results revealed a significant ingestion of MPs 
      in earthworms with values ranging from 1.13 to 35.6, characterized mostly by PE, 
      PBAT and polypropylene (PP). Biochemical data revealed an important alteration in 
      worms exposed to MPs from soils with mulching and irrigated with TWW. Our study 
      provides new insights into the effects of microplastic in earthworms and thus the 
      vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystem to this emergent contaminant.

AB  - The contamination of the environment with microplastic, defined as particles smaller 
      than 5 mm, has emerged as a global challenge because it may pose risks to biota and 
      public health. Current research focuses predominantly on aquatic systems, whereas 
      comparatively little is known regarding the sources, pathways, and possible 
      accumulation of plastic particles in terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated the 
      potential of organic fertilizers from biowaste fermentation and composting as an 
      entry path for microplastic particles into the environment. Particles were 
      classified by size and identified by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform 
      infrared spectroscopy. All fertilizer samples from plants converting biowaste 
      contained plastic particles, but amounts differed significantly with substrate 
      pretreatment, plant, and waste (for example, household versus commerce) type. In 
      contrast, digestates from agricultural energy crop digesters tested for comparison 
      contained only isolated particles, if any. Among the most abundant synthetic 
      polymers observed were those used for common consumer products. Our results indicate 
      that depending on pretreatment, organic fertilizers from biowaste fermentation and 
      composting, as applied in agriculture and gardening worldwide, are a neglected 
      source of microplastic in the environment.

TI  - Occurrence, fate, behavior and ecotoxicological state of phthalates in different 
      environmental matrices.
PG  - 4019-35
LID - 10.1021/es505233b [doi]
AB  - Because of their large and widespread application, phthalates or phthalic acid 
      esters (PAEs) are ubiquitous in all the environmental compartements. They have been 
      widely detected throughout the worldwide environment. Indoor air where people spend 
      65-90% of their time is also highly contaminated by various PAEs released from 
      plastics, consumer products as well as ambient suspended particulate matter. Because 
      of their widespread application, PAEs are the most common chemicals that humans are 
      in contact with daily. Based on various exposure mechanisms, including the ingestion 
      of food, drinking water, dust/soil, air inhalation and dermal exposure the daily 
      intake of PAEs may reach values as high as 70 μg/kg/day. PAEs are involved in 
      endocrine disrupting effects, namely, upon reproductive physiology in different 
      species of fish and mammals. They also present a variety of additional toxic effects 
      for many other species including terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora. Therefore, 
      their presence in the environment has attracted considerable attention due to their 
      potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and on public health. This paper is a 
      synthesis of the extensive literature data on behavior, transport, fate and 
      ecotoxicological state of PAEs in environmental matrices: air, water, sediment, 
      sludge, wastewater, soil, and biota. First, the origins and physicochemical 
      properties of PAEs that control the behavior, transport and fate in the environment 
      are reviewed. Second, the compilation of data on transport and fate, adverse 
      environmental and human health effects, legislation, restrictions, and 
      ecotoxicological state of the environment based on PAEs is presented.

TI  - The influence of weather conditions during gestation on life histories in a wild 
      Arctic ungulate.
LID - 20161760
AB  - The internal predictive adaptive response (internal PAR) hypothesis predicts that 
      individuals born in poor conditions should start to reproduce earlier if they are 
      likely to have reduced performance in later life. However, whether this is the case 
      remains unexplored in wild populations. Here, we use longitudinal data from a 
      long-term study of Svalbard reindeer to examine age-related changes in adult female 
      life-history responses to environmental conditions experienced in utero as indexed 
      by rain-on-snow (ROS(utero)). We show that females experiencing high ROS(utero) had 
      reduced reproductive success only from 7 years of age, independent of early 
      reproduction. These individuals were able to maintain the same annual reproductive 
      success between 2 and 6 years as phenotypically superior conspecifics that 
      experienced low ROS(utero) Young females born after high ROS(utero) engage in 
      reproductive events at lower body mass (about 2.5 kg less) than those born after low 
      ROS(utero) The mean fitness of females that experienced poor environmental 
      conditions in early life was comparable with that of females exposed to good 
      environmental conditions in early life. These results are consistent with the idea 
      of internal PAR and suggest that the life-history responses to early-life conditions 
      can buffer the delayed effects of weather on population dynamics.

LID - 468
AB  - Microbes commonly display great genetic plasticity, which has allowed them to 
      colonize all ecological niches on Earth. Bacillus subtilis is a soil-dwelling 
      organism that can be isolated from a wide variety of environments. An interesting 
      characteristic of this bacterium is its ability to form biofilms that display 
      complex heterogeneity: individual, clonal cells develop diverse phenotypes in 
      response to different environmental conditions within the biofilm. Here, we 
      scrutinized the impact that the number and variety of the Rap-Phr family of 
      regulators and cell-cell communication modules of B. subtilis has on genetic 
      adaptation and evolution. We examine how the Rap family of phosphatase regulators 
      impacts sporulation in diverse niches using a library of single and double rap-phr 
      mutants in competition under 4 distinct growth conditions. Using specific DNA 
      barcodes and whole-genome sequencing, population dynamics were followed, revealing 
      the impact of individual Rap phosphatases and arising mutations on the adaptability 
      of B. subtilis.

TI  - Urbanization-driven changes in web building and body size in an orb web spider.
PG  - 79-91
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12909 [doi]
AB  - In animals, behavioural responses may play an important role in determining 
      population persistence in the face of environmental changes. Body size is a key 
      trait central to many life-history traits and behaviours. Correlations with body 
      size may constrain behavioural variation in response to environmental changes, 
      especially when size itself is influenced by environmental conditions. Urbanization 
      is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple 
      selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these 
      combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear. Using 
      web building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size and the garden 
      spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we evaluated direct behavioural responses to 
      urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations 
      differing in urbanization intensity. We additionally studied urbanization at two 
      spatial scales to account for some environmental pressures varying across scales and 
      to obtain first qualitative insights about the role of plasticity and genetic 
      selection. Spiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in 
      line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat 
      Island effect. Web surface and mesh width decreased with urbanization at the local 
      scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. 
      The latter two responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced 
      prey biomass availability in cities. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals 
      that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, 
      behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there 
      is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes, and 
      web traits appear independent from each other. Our results demonstrate that 
      responses in size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby 
      allowing fitness maximization in novel environments. The spatial scale at which 
      traits respond suggests contributions of both genetic adaptation (for web 
      investment) and plasticity (for mesh width). Although fecundity decreased with 
      local-scale urbanization, A. diadematus abundances were similar across urbanization 
      gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population 
      level.

TI  - Coping with the climate: cuticular hydrocarbon acclimation of ants under constant 
      and fluctuating conditions.
LID - jeb171488 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.171488 [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial arthropods achieve waterproofing by a layer of cuticular hydrocarbons 
      (CHCs). At the same time, CHCs also serve as communication signals. To maintain 
      waterproofing under different climate conditions, insects adjust the chemical 
      composition of their CHC layer, but this may affect the communication via CHCs. The 
      detailed acclimatory changes of CHCs and how these influence their physical 
      properties are still unknown. Here, we studied acclimation in two closely related 
      ant species with distinct CHC profiles, Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis, in 
      response to constant or fluctuating temperature and humidity regimes. We measured 
      how acclimation affected CHC composition and viscosity, and the ants' drought 
      survival. In both species, CHC composition showed strong, predictable responses to 
      temperature regimes. Warm-acclimated individuals had higher proportions of linear 
      alkanes, and less methyl-branched or unsaturated CHCs. These changes coincided with 
      higher solid content and viscosity of CHCs in warm-acclimated ants. Temperature 
      fluctuation caused effects similar to those observed under constant-cool conditions 
      in Mrubra, but led to entirely different profiles in Mruginodis, suggesting that 
      fluctuating and constant conditions pose very different challenges. Acclimation to 
      dry conditions led to higher absolute amounts of CHCs, which increased the ants' 
      drought survival, whereas temperature acclimation did not. Hence, the 
      temperature-induced CHC changes cannot be explained by the need for waterproofing 
      alone. Although these changes could be non-adaptive, we propose that they serve to 
      maintain a constant CHC viscosity, which may be essential for communication and 
      other functions.

TI  - Brucella Genetic Variability in Wildlife Marine Mammals Populations Relates to Host 
      Preference and Ocean Distribution.
PG  - 1901-1912
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evx137 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular bacterial pathogens probably arose when their ancestor adapted from a 
      free-living environment to an intracellular one, leading to clonal bacteria with 
      smaller genomes and less sources of genetic plasticity. Still, this plasticity is 
      needed to respond to the challenges posed by the host. Members of the Brucella genus 
      are facultative-extracellular intracellular bacteria responsible for causing 
      brucellosis in a variety of mammals. The various species keep different host 
      preferences, virulence, and zoonotic potential despite having 97-99% similarity at 
      genome level. Here, we describe elements of genetic variation in Brucella ceti 
      isolated from wildlife dolphins inhabiting the Pacific Ocean and the Mediterranean 
      Sea. Comparison with isolates obtained from marine mammals from the Atlantic Ocean 
      and the broader Brucella genus showed distinctive traits according to oceanic 
      distribution and preferred host. Marine mammal isolates display genetic variability, 
      represented by an important number of IS711 elements as well as specific IS711 and 
      SNPs genomic distribution clustering patterns. Extensive pseudogenization was found 
      among isolates from marine mammals as compared with terrestrial ones, causing 
      degradation in pathways related to energy, transport of metabolites, and 
      regulation/transcription. Brucella ceti isolates infecting particularly dolphin 
      hosts, showed further degradation of metabolite transport pathways as well as 
      pathways related to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and motility. Thus, gene 
      loss through pseudogenization is a source of genetic variation in Brucella, which in 
      turn, relates to adaptation to different hosts. This is relevant to understand the 
      natural history of bacterial diseases, their zoonotic potential, and the impact of 
      human interventions such as domestication.

TI  - Plasticity of archaeal C/D box sRNA biogenesis.
PG  - 151-164
LID - 10.1111/mmi.13549 [doi]
AB  - Archaeal and eukaryotic organisms contain sets of C/D box s(no)RNAs with guide 
      sequences that determine ribose 2'-O-methylation sites of target RNAs. The 
      composition of these C/D box sRNA sets is highly variable between organisms and 
      results in varying RNA modification patterns which are important for ribosomal RNA 
      folding and stability. Little is known about the genomic organization of C/D box 
      sRNA genes in archaea. Here, we aimed to obtain first insights into the biogenesis 
      of these archaeal C/D box sRNAs and analyzed the genetic context of more than 300 
      archaeal sRNA genes. We found that the majority of these genes do not possess 
      independent promoters but are rather located at positions that allow for 
      co-transcription with neighboring genes and their start or stop codons were 
      frequently incorporated into the conserved boxC and D motifs. The biogenesis of 
      plasmid-encoded C/D box sRNA variants was analyzed in vivo in Sulfolobus 
      acidocaldarius. It was found that C/D box sRNA maturation occurs independent of 
      their genetic context and relies solely on the presence of intact RNA kink-turn 
      structures. The observed plasticity of C/D box sRNA biogenesis is suggested to 
      enable their accelerated evolution and, consequently, allow for adjustments of the 
      RNA modification landscape.

TI  - Evolution of prokaryotic respiratory molybdoenzymes and the frequency of their 
      genomic co-occurrence.
LID - fiw187 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiw187 [doi]
AB  - Molybdoenzymes are an ancient protein family found in phylogenetically and 
      ecologically diverse prokaryotes. Under anaerobic conditions, respiratory 
      molybdoenzymes catalyze redox reactions that transfer electrons to a variety of 
      substrates that act as terminal electron acceptors for energy generation. Here, we 
      used probe sequences to conduct an extensive genomic survey and phylogenetic 
      inference for NarG, DmsA, TorA and nine other respiratory molybdoenzyme subfamilies. 
      Our analysis demonstrates their abundance in 60% of prokaryotic phyla. In contrast 
      to many other autonomic genetic units in prokaryotes, the major route of evolution 
      of their predominant subfamilies is vertical gene transfer, gene duplication and 
      divergence. Our results show the robustness of genomic co-occurrence of respiratory 
      molybdoenzymes genes, found in the majority of studied species, for most of the 
      enzyme subfamilies. Genomes which encode for multiple respiratory molybdoenzymes are 
      also enriched in genes regulating replication, recombination and mobility of genetic 
      elements. Respiratory molybdoenzymes were found in prokaryotes associated with 
      diverse environments occupying terrestrial, aquatic, food and host-related habitats, 
      emphasizing their essential role in adaptation of prokaryotes to changing 
      environments. Interestingly, host-associated prokaryotes such as human pathogens 
      more frequently carry multiple respiratory molybdoenzyme genes compared with 
      non-host-associated prokaryotes, highlighting the importance of metabolic 
      flexibility in host-microbiome environments.

TI  - Assessing the components of adaptive capacity to improve conservation and management 
      efforts under global change.
PG  - 1268-78
LID - 10.1111/cobi.12522 [doi]
AB  - Natural-resource managers and other conservation practitioners are under 
      unprecedented pressure to categorize and quantify the vulnerability of natural 
      systems based on assessment of the exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of 
      species to climate change. Despite the urgent need for these assessments, neither 
      the theoretical basis of adaptive capacity nor the practical issues underlying its 
      quantification has been articulated in a manner that is directly applicable to 
      natural-resource management. Both are critical for researchers, managers, and other 
      conservation practitioners to develop reliable strategies for assessing adaptive 
      capacity. Drawing from principles of classical and contemporary research and 
      examples from terrestrial, marine, plant, and animal systems, we examined broadly 
      the theory behind the concept of adaptive capacity. We then considered how 
      interdisciplinary, trait- and triage-based approaches encompassing the 
      oft-overlooked interactions among components of adaptive capacity can be used to 
      identify species and populations likely to have higher (or lower) adaptive capacity. 
      We identified the challenges and value of such endeavors and argue for a concerted 
      interdisciplinary research approach that combines ecology, ecological genetics, and 
      eco-physiology to reflect the interacting components of adaptive capacity. We aimed 
      to provide a basis for constructive discussion between natural-resource managers and 
      researchers, discussions urgently needed to identify research directions that will 
      deliver answers to real-world questions facing resource managers, other conservation 
      practitioners, and policy makers. Directing research to both seek general patterns 
      and identify ways to facilitate adaptive capacity of key species and populations 
      within species, will enable conservation ecologists and resource managers to 
      maximize returns on research and management investment and arrive at novel and 
      dynamic management and policy decisions.

AB  - Regulatory networks play a central role in the relationship between genotype and 
      phenotype in all organisms. However, the mechanisms that underpin the evolutionary 
      plasticity of these networks remain poorly understood. Here, we used experimental 
      selection for enhanced bacterial motility in a porous environment to explore the 
      adaptability of one of the most complex networks known in bacteria. We found that 
      the resulting phenotypic changes are mediated by adaptive mutations in several 
      functionally different proteins, including multiple components of the flagellar 
      motor. Nevertheless, this evolutionary adaptation could be explained by a single 
      mechanism, namely remodeling of the checkpoint regulating flagellar gene expression. 
      Supported by computer simulations, our findings suggest that the specific "bow-tie" 
      topology of the checkpoint facilitates evolutionary tuning of the cost-benefit 
      trade-off between motility and growth. We propose that bow-tie regulatory motifs, 
      which are widespread in cellular networks, play a general role in evolutionary 
      adaptation.

TI  - The survival of terrestrial microorganisms in space at orbital altitudes during 
      Gemini satellite experiments.
PG  - 108-14
AB  - In a previous series of rocket- and satellite-borne experiments, microorganisms were 
      exposed to space between altitudes of 60 to 460 km for periods between 3 minutes and 
      4 months. The results showed that some of the unprotected microorganisms survived 
      the direct exposure for up to 17 hours. Complete survival was found when the 
      microorganisms were shielded from nonpenetrating radiation. These results made it 
      desirable to systematically study the lethal influence of the space environment on a 
      wider spectrum of unprotected microorganisms over various exposure periods. This 
      communication presents the results of exposure experiments on board the Gemini XII 
      satellite. The microorganisms were dried on plastic coated aluminum plates using 
      techniques which will be described elsewhere. During the flight of the Gemini XII 
      space capsule, the microorganisms were directly exposed to space for approximately 6 
      1/2 hours. After the successful completion of the Gemini XII mission the payload was 
      returned to the laboratory for elution and titration of the microorganisms using 
      techniques described elsewhere. The results showed that again survival of some 
      microorganisms had occurred. An attempt is made to integrate these results with data 
      obtained in previously published experiments.

LID - 656465
AB  - Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is globally the largest produced aromatic polyester 
      with an annual production exceeding 50 million metric tons. PET can be mechanically 
      and chemically recycled; however, the extra costs in chemical recycling are not 
      justified when converting PET back to the original polymer, which leads to less than 
      30% of PET produced annually to be recycled. Hence, waste PET massively contributes 
      to plastic pollution and damaging the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The global 
      energy and environmental concerns with PET highlight a clear need for technologies 
      in PET "upcycling," the creation of higher-value products from reclaimed PET. 
      Several microbes that degrade PET and corresponding PET hydrolase enzymes have been 
      successfully identified. The characterization and engineering of these enzymes to 
      selectively depolymerize PET into original monomers such as terephthalic acid and 
      ethylene glycol have been successful. Synthetic microbiology and metabolic 
      engineering approaches enable the development of efficient microbial cell factories 
      to convert PET-derived monomers into value-added products. In this mini-review, we 
      present the recent progress of engineering microbes to produce higher-value chemical 
      building blocks from waste PET using a wholly biological and a hybrid 
      chemocatalytic-biological strategy. We also highlight the potent metabolic pathways 
      to bio-upcycle PET into high-value biotransformed molecules. The new synthetic 
      microbes will help establish the circular materials economy, alleviate the adverse 
      energy and environmental impacts of PET, and provide market incentives for PET 
      reclamation.

TI  - Role of orthopyroxene in rheological weakening of the lithosphere via dynamic 
      recrystallization.
PG  - 16355-60
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1218335110 [doi]
AB  - For plate tectonics to operate on a terrestrial planet, the surface layer (the 
      lithosphere) must have a modest strength (Earth, ≤ 200 MPa), but a standard strength 
      profile based on olivine far exceeds this threshold value. Consequently, it is 
      essential to identify mechanisms that reduce the strength of the lithosphere on 
      Earth. Here we report results of high-strain laboratory deformation experiments on a 
      representative olivine-orthopyroxene composition that show the addition of 
      orthopyroxene substantially reduces the strength in the ductile regime within a 
      certain temperature window. The reduction in strength is associated with the 
      formation of small orthopyroxene and olivine grains. Our samples show heterogeneous 
      microstructures similar to those observed in natural peridotites in shear zones: 
      fine-grained regions containing both orthopyroxene and olivine that form 
      interconnected bands where a large fraction of strain is accommodated. A model is 
      developed to apply these results to geological conditions. Such a model, combined 
      with our experimental observations, suggests that orthopyroxene may play a key role 
      in the plastic deformation of the lithosphere in a critical temperature range, 
      leading to long-term weakening associated with strain localization in the 
      lithosphere.

AB  - Terrestrial salamanders are able to detect prey items using chemical cues, but the 
      nature of the cues involved is uncertain. This study aimed to tease apart the roles 
      of the soluble and volatile components of prey cues detected by Eastern red-backed 
      salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), assuming the likelihood that these different 
      components are respectively detected by the vomeronasal (accessory) and main 
      olfactory organs. Wild-caught salamanders were exposed to control or soluble and 
      volatile cricket cues in two different behavioural assays conducted in the 
      laboratory. The first series of assays focused on localized presentation of soluble 
      cues on the substrate, and the second on point sources of volatile cues delivered 
      through plastic tubes. Room temperature was varied across experiments. Salamanders 
      increased chemoinvestigation of the substrate via nosetapping when soluble prey cues 
      were distributed non-uniformly on the substrate. In the warmer of two temperatures 
      tested, salamanders additionally showed a spatial preference for location of soluble 
      cue deposition. Attraction to a point source of volatile cues was not evident when 
      examining the responses of salamanders grouped together; however, investigation of 
      the volatile point source was significantly correlated with side preference only 
      when both soluble cues and a volatile point source were present. The latter suggests 
      that a subset of salamanders were attracted to the point source of volatile cues in 
      the presence of soluble cues on the substrate. This study indicates that soluble 
      prey cues alone are sufficient to trigger salamander foraging behaviour, and that 
      temperature influences this foraging response. It supports the notion that the 
      vomeronasal system plays an important role in prey detection, but suggests that 
      volatile cues are also investigated by some salamanders when soluble prey cues have 
      been detected.

LID - 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.09.103 [doi]
AB  - Polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardant additives and have 
      been mainly used in polymers for many plastic and electronic products. PBDEs have 
      been found to bioaccumulate in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and even 
      human bodies. The technical product with the highest use is decabrominated diphenyl 
      ether (BDE-209). Therefore, we chose to examine the solar and UV-lamp degradation of 
      BDE-209. A linear increase of the photodegradation rate constant for BDE-209 was 
      observed with the solar light intensity. The degradation reactions follow the 
      pseudo-first-order kinetics. The photodegradation of BDE-209 produced other less 
      brominated diphenyl ethers under ultraviolet light exposure, suggesting that the 
      photodegradation of BDE-209 is a sequential dehalogenation mechanism. BDE-209 
      underwent rapid reductive debromination in these photodecomposition experiments. The 
      formation rate constants of three nonabromodiphenyl ethers increase with the order 
      of BDE-206, BDE-207 and BDE-208, indicating debromination mainly occurred at 
      para>meta>ortho positions. These findings of the process properties and reductive 
      debromination mechanism of the photolytic degradation of PBDEs can facilitate the 
      design of remediation processes and also aid in predicting their fate in the 
      environment.

TI  - Green wave tracking by large herbivores: an experimental approach.
PG  - 3547-3553

AB  - The forage maturation hypothesis (FMH) states that herbivores should follow the 
      onset of growth in spring to obtain access to forage of higher quality and quantity, 
      the so-called "green wave surfing." Several studies have found correlative evidence 
      in support of this by associating animal movement with plant phenology. However, 
      experimental manipulation of vast natural systems determining causes of large 
      herbivore movement is usually beyond reach. The unique management system involving 
      winter enclosures for wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Germany facilitated an 
      opportunity for an experimental approach. We manipulated release dates of red deer 
      into free-ranging conditions in spring, predicting increased overall access to high 
      quality forage if released early (1 April), and more rapid initial movement speed 
      towards higher elevation if released late (15 May). The latter had lower access to 
      high quality forage than individuals released early, as they missed parts of the 
      green wave. In strong support of the FMH, individuals released late moved at faster 
      initial speed than early released individuals which tracked the green wave more 
      closely, both settling when reaching similar elevations. This shows that red deer 
      were flexible in their movements, and they can adapt to new patterns of phenology by 
      phenotypic plasticity.

LID - 10.1111/jpy.12490 [doi]
AB  - Cyanobacteria occupy many niches within terrestrial, planktonic, and benthic 
      habitats. The diversity of habitats colonized, similarity of morphology, and 
      phenotypic plasticity all contribute to the difficulty of cyanobacterial 
      identification. An unknown marine filamentous cyanobacterium was isolated from an 
      aquatic animal rearing facility having mysid mortality events. The cyanobacterium 
      originated from Corpus Christi Bay, TX. Filaments are rarely solitary, benthic mat 
      forming, unbranched, and narrowing at the ends. Cells are 2.1 × 3.1 μm 
      (width × length). Thylakoids are peripherally arranged on the outer third of the 
      cell; cyanophycin granules and polyphosphate bodies are present. Molecular 
      phylogenetic analysis in addition to morphology (transmission electron microscopy 
      and scanning electron microscopy) and chemical composition all confirm it as a new 
      genus and species we name Toxifilum mysidocida. At least one identified Leptolyngbya 
      appears (based on genetic evidence and TEM) to belong to this new genus.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of oxalotrophic bacteria from tropical soils.
PG  - 65-77
LID - 10.1007/s00203-014-1055-2 [doi]
AB  - The oxalate-carbonate pathway (OCP) is a biogeochemical set of reactions that 
      involves the conversion of atmospheric CO2 fixed by plants into biomass and, after 
      the biological recycling of calcium oxalate by fungi and bacteria, into calcium 
      carbonate in terrestrial environments. Oxalotrophic bacteria are a key element of 
      this process because of their ability to oxidize calcium oxalate. However, the 
      diversity and alternative carbon sources of oxalotrophs participating to this 
      pathway are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize 
      oxalotrophic bacteria in tropical OCP systems from Bolivia, India, and Cameroon. 
      Ninety-five oxalotrophic strains were isolated and identified by sequencing of the 
      16S rRNA gene. Four genera corresponded to newly reported oxalotrophs (Afipia, 
      Polaromonas, Humihabitans, and Psychrobacillus). Ten strains were selected to 
      perform a more detailed characterization. Kinetic curves and microcalorimetry 
      analyses showed that Variovorax soli C18 has the highest oxalate consumption rate 
      with 0.240 µM h(-1). Moreover, Streptomyces achromogenes A9 displays the highest 
      metabolic plasticity. This study highlights the phylogenetic and physiological 
      diversity of oxalotrophic bacteria in tropical soils under the influence of the 
      oxalate-carbonate pathway.

TI  - Three-dimensional laser imaging as a valuable tool for specifying changes in breast 
      shape after augmentation mammaplasty.
PG  - 191-5
LID - 10.1007/s00266-008-9259-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional (3D) terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a valuable 
      method for measuring shapes of objects and for obtaining quantitative measurements. 
      These qualities of the 3D laser scanner have proved to be useful in reconstructive 
      breast surgery. This study investigated various 3D parameters to obtain an optimal 
      objective visualization of the breast after cosmetic augmentation mammaplasty. 
      METHODS: The objects are represented in a point cloud, which comprises millions of 
      x, y, and z coordinates representing a virtual image. The quantification of 3D 
      points shows changes in height (z coordinate) at any chosen point on the augmented 
      breast (x and y coordinates). To give visual feedback on the change in dimensions, a 
      color elevation scheme was applied on the reconstructed surface of the breast. As a 
      quantifying description, a sagittal B-spline was chosen in a plane through the 
      nipple to obtain the breast shape via the lateral profile. RESULTS: Pre- and 
      postoperative clear images were obtained. The color elevation model showed an 
      increased projection and upper pole fullness after augmentation. The B-spline showed 
      the gain in projection in a sagittal plane through the nipple. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Three-dimensional TLS is capable of objectifying changes in shape after augmentation 
      mammaplasty. This imaging technique represents superior visualization of the breast 
      shape and can serve as a valuable tool to determine the changing dimensions of the 
      breasts after augmentation mammaplasty.

      latitude and elevation.
PG  - 5610-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1316145111 [doi]
AB  - Physiological thermal-tolerance limits of terrestrial ectotherms often exceed local 
      air temperatures, implying a high degree of thermal safety (an excess of warm or 
      cold thermal tolerance). However, air temperatures can be very different from the 
      equilibrium body temperature of an individual ectotherm. Here, we compile 
      thermal-tolerance limits of ectotherms across a wide range of latitudes and 
      elevations and compare these thermal limits both to air and to operative body 
      temperatures (theoretically equilibrated body temperatures) of small ectothermic 
      animals during the warmest and coldest times of the year. We show that extreme 
      operative body temperatures in exposed habitats match or exceed the physiological 
      thermal limits of most ectotherms. Therefore, contrary to previous findings using 
      air temperatures, most ectotherms do not have a physiological thermal-safety margin. 
      They must therefore rely on behavior to avoid overheating during the warmest times, 
      especially in the lowland tropics. Likewise, species living at temperate latitudes 
      and in alpine habitats must retreat to avoid lethal cold exposure. Behavioral 
      plasticity of habitat use and the energetic consequences of thermal retreats are 
      therefore critical aspects of species' vulnerability to climate warming and extreme 
      events.

TI  - Climate affects symbiotic fungal endophyte diversity and performance.
PG  - 1435-44
LID - 10.3732/ajb.1200568 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Fungal endophytes are symbionts that inhabit aboveground 
      tissues of most terrestrial plants and can affect plant physiology and growth under 
      stressed conditions. In a future faced with substantial climate change, endophytes 
      have the potential to play an important role in plant stress resistance. 
      Understanding both the distributions of endophytes and their functioning in 
      symbiosis with plants are key aspects of predicting their role in an altered 
      climate. METHODS: Here we characterized endophytes in grasses across a steep 
      precipitation gradient to examine the relative importance of environmental and 
      spatial factors in structuring endophyte communities. We also tested how 20 
      endophytes isolated from drier and wetter regions performed in symbiosis with grass 
      seedlings under high and low soil moisture in the greenhouse. KEY RESULTS: 
      Environmental factors related to historical and current precipitation were the most 
      important predictors of endophyte communities in the field. On average, endophytic 
      fungi from western sites also reduced plant water loss in the greenhouse compared to 
      fungi from eastern sites. However, there was substantial variability in how 
      individual endophytic taxa affected plant traits under high and low water 
      availability, with up to two orders of magnitude difference in the plasticity of 
      plant traits conferred by the different fungal taxa. CONCLUSIONS: While species 
      sorting appears to largely explain local endophyte community composition, their 
      function in symbiosis is not predictable from local environmental conditions. The 
      development of a predictive framework for endophyte function will require further 
      study of individual fungal taxa and genotypes across environmental gradients.

AB  - Heritable epigenetic modulation of gene expression is a candidate mechanism to 
      explain parental environmental effects on offspring phenotypes, but current evidence 
      for environment-induced epigenetic changes that persist in offspring generations is 
      scarce. In apomictic dandelions, exposure to various stresses was previously shown 
      to heritably alter DNA methylation patterns. In this study we explore whether these 
      induced changes are accompanied by heritable effects on offspring phenotypes. We 
      observed effects of parental jasmonic acid treatment on offspring specific leaf area 
      and on offspring interaction with a generalist herbivore; and of parental nutrient 
      stress on offspring root-shoot biomass ratio, tissue P-content and leaf morphology. 
      Some of the effects appeared to enhance offspring ability to cope with the same 
      stresses that their parents experienced. Effects differed between apomictic 
      genotypes and were not always consistently observed between different experiments, 
      especially in the case of parental nutrient stress. While this context-dependency of 
      the effects remains to be further clarified, the total set of results provides 
      evidence for the existence of transgenerational effects in apomictic dandelions. 
      Zebularine treatment affected the within-generation response to nutrient stress, 
      pointing at a role of DNA methylation in phenotypic plasticity to nutrient 
      environments. This study shows that stress exposure in apomictic dandelions can 
      cause transgenerational phenotypic effects, in addition to previously demonstrated 
      transgenerational DNA methylation effects.

TI  - From metamorphosis to maturity in complex life cycles: equal performance of 
      different juvenile life history pathways.
PG  - 657-67
AB  - Performance in one stage of a complex life cycle may affect performance in the 
      subsequent stage. Animals that start a new stage at a smaller size than conspecifics 
      may either always remain smaller or they may be able to "catch up" through 
      plasticity, usually elevated growth rates. We study how size at and date of 
      metamorphosis affected subsequent performance in the terrestrial juvenile stage and 
      lifetime fitness of spadefoot toads (Pelobates fuscus). We analyzed 
      capture-recapture data of > 3000 individuals sampled during nine years with 
      mark-recapture models to estimate first-year juvenile survival probabilities and 
      age-specific first-time breeding probabilities of toads, followed by model selection 
      to assess whether these probabilities were correlated with size at and date of 
      metamorphosis. Males attained maturity after two years, whereas females reached 
      maturity 2-4 years after metamorphosis. Age at maturity was weakly correlated with 
      metamorphic traits. In both sexes, first-year juvenile survival depended positively 
      on date of metamorphosis and, in males, also negatively on size at metamorphosis. In 
      males, toads that metamorphosed early at a small size had the highest probability to 
      reach maturity. However, because very few toadlets metamorphosed early, the vast 
      majority of male metamorphs had a very similar probability to reach maturity. A 
      matrix projection model constructed for females showed that different juvenile life 
      history pathways resulted in similar lifetime fitness. We found that the effects of 
      date of and size at metamorphosis on different juvenile traits cancelled each other 
      out such that toads that were small or large at metamorphosis had equal performance. 
      Because the costs and benefits of juvenile life history pathways may also depend on 
      population fluctuations, ample phenotypic variation in life history traits may be 
      maintained.

TI  - Molecular adaptation of rbcL in the heterophyllous aquatic plant Potamogeton.
PG  - e4633
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0004633 [doi]
LID - e4633
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterophyllous aquatic plants show marked phenotypic plasticity. They 
      adapt to environmental changes by producing different leaf types: submerged, 
      floating and terrestrial leaves. By contrast, homophyllous plants produce only 
      submerged leaves and grow entirely underwater. Heterophylly and submerged homophylly 
      evolved under selective pressure modifying the species-specific optima for 
      photosynthesis, but little is known about the evolutionary outcome of habit. Recent 
      evolutionary analyses suggested that rbcL, a chloroplast gene that encodes a 
      catalytic subunit of RuBisCO, evolves under positive selection in most land plant 
      lineages. To examine the adaptive evolutionary process linked to heterophylly or 
      homophylly, we analyzed positive selection in the rbcL sequences of ecologically 
      diverse aquatic plants, Japanese Potamogeton. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Phylogenetic and 
      maximum likelihood analyses of codon substitution models indicated that Potamogeton 
      rbcL has evolved under positive Darwinian selection. The positive selection has 
      operated specifically in heterophyllous lineages but not in homophyllous ones in the 
      branch-site models. This suggests that the selective pressure on this chloroplast 
      gene was higher for heterophyllous lineages than for homophyllous lineages. The 
      replacement of 12 amino acids occurred at structurally important sites in the 
      quaternary structure of RbcL, two of which (residue 225 and 281) were identified as 
      potentially under positive selection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis did not 
      show an exact relationship between the amino acid replacements and heterophylly or 
      homophylly but revealed that lineage-specific positive selection acted on the 
      Potamogeton rbcL. The contrasting ecological conditions between heterophyllous and 
      homophyllous plants have imposed different selective pressures on the photosynthetic 
      system. The increased amino acid replacement in RbcL may reflect the continuous 
      fine-tuning of RuBisCO under varying ecological conditions.

TI  - Evolutionary ecology of facultative paedomorphosis in newts and salamanders.
PG  - 663-71
AB  - Facultative paedomorphosis is an environmentally induced polymorphism that results 
      in the coexistence of mature, gilled, and fully aquatic paedomorphic adults and 
      transformed, terrestrial, metamorphic adults in the same population. This 
      polymorphism has been of interest to scientists for decades because it occurs in a 
      large number of caudate amphibian taxa as well as in a large diversity of habitats. 
      Numerous experimental and observational studies have been conducted to explain the 
      proximate and ultimate factors affecting these heterochronic variants in natural 
      populations. The production of each alternative phenotype is based on a 
      genotypexenvironment interaction and research suggests that differences in the 
      environment can produce paedomorphs through several ontogenetic pathways. No single 
      advantage accounts for the maintenance of this polymorphism. Rather, the interplay 
      of different costs and benefits explains the success of the polyphenism across 
      variable environments. Facultative paedomorphosis allows individuals to cope with 
      habitat variation, to take advantage of environmental heterogeneity in the presence 
      of open niches, and to increase their fitness. This process is expected to 
      constitute a first step towards speciation events, and is also an example of 
      biodiversity at the intraspecific level. The facultative paedomorphosis system is 
      thus ripe for future studies encompassing ecology, evolution, behaviour, 
      endocrinology, physiology, and conservation biology. Few other systems have been 
      broad enough to provide varied research opportunities on topics as diverse as 
      phenotypic plasticity, speciation, mating behaviour, and hormonal regulation of 
      morphology. Further research on facultative paedomorphosis will provide needed 
      insight into these and other important questions facing biologists.

TI  - Postflight balance control recovery in an elderly astronaut: a case report.
PG  - 53-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the sensorimotor adaptive response of a 77-year-old man 
      exposed to the gravito-inertial challenges of orbital space flight. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Prospective case study with retrospective comparisons. SETTING: NASA Neurosciences 
      Laboratory (Johnson Space Center) and Baseline Data Collection Facility (Kennedy 
      Space Center). PRIMARY PARTICIPANT: One 77-year-old male shuttle astronaut. 
      INTERVENTION: Insertion into low Earth orbit was used to remove gravitational 
      stimuli and thereby trigger sensorimotor adaptation to the microgravity environment. 
      Graviceptor stimulation was reintroduced at landing, and sensorimotor readaptation 
      to the terrestrial environment was tracked to completion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Computerized dynamic posturography tests were administered before and after orbital 
      flight to determine the magnitude and time course of recovery. RESULTS: The elderly 
      astronaut exhibited balance control performance decrements on landing day; however, 
      there were no significant differences between his performance and that of younger 
      astronauts tested on the same shuttle mission or on previous shuttle missions of 
      similar duration. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the physiological 
      changes attributed to aging do not necessarily impair adaptive sensorimotor control 
      processes.

TI  - Community structure and dynamics in desert ecosystems: potential implications for 
      insecticide risk assessment.
PG  - 11-21
AB  - Insecticides are increasingly being used in hot arid ecosystems. The evaluation of 
      the ecological risk these insecticides may pose, however, is based largely on data 
      derived from temperate organisms and ecosystems. The major differences in the 
      composition, structure, and functioning of desert animal communities when compared 
      to temperate terrestrial ecosystems are discussed. Desert communities are 
      characterized by a high fraction of ectotherms (both vertebrates and 
      invertebrates);rodents and insectivores appear to dominate the mammalian fauna; and 
      detritivores make up a very large part of the arthropod fauna. Presently available 
      toxicity data cover these groups only to a very limited extent. It is not known if 
      the ranges of insecticide susceptibility observed in temperate species are 
      representative of those in arid organisms. Thus, it is not certain that 
      ecotoxicological assessments based on such data sets adequately protect desert 
      animal communities. It is shown that food web connectance is higher in desert 
      ecosystems than in temperate grasslands or forests. This may to a large extent be 
      due to the high degree of omnivory among desert organisms. Population regulation 
      between predators and prey appears to be weaker in deserts. The same is often, 
      though not always, the case for competition among desert organisms. It is argued 
      that such characteristics will reduce the chance that strong indirect effects of 
      insecticide perturbations will occur. In spite of the fact that many desert 
      organisms are well adapted to cope with high temporal and spatial environmental 
      variability, there is no reason to believe that they will always recover more 
      rapidly from population perturbations caused by insecticides. The relatively large 
      physiological and life-history plasticity encountered in many desert animals may 
      increase tolerance to insecticide stress. Food chains are longer in deserts than in 
      temperate grasslands and forests. The implications of this observation for the risk 
      of biomagnification of contaminants are discussed.

TI  - Serotonin-stimulated biochemical events in the procerebrum of Limax.
PG  - 447-59
AB  - 1. The procerebrum (PC) of the terrestrial slug Limax maximus is of interest as a 
      potential site of olfactory information processing (Gelperin et al., 1989). The 
      neuromodulator serotonin is present in the procerebrum and can elicit action 
      potentials from cultured procerebral neurons. We have investigated the effects of 
      serotonin on second-messenger signaling systems and protein phosphorylation as a 
      prelude to studies on long-term synaptic plasticity in the Limax procerebral lobe. 
      2. We found that several biochemical changes are triggered within 20 min of adding 
      serotonin to the isolated procerebral lobe: adenylate cyclase is activated, protein 
      phosphorylation and synthesis are modulated, and phosphatidylinositol-metabolism is 
      stimulated. 3. Serotonin causes a rapid synthesis of cAMP, reaching a 20- to 30-fold 
      increase within 1 min. Serotonin affects the rate of phosphorylation of several 
      proteins, detected after a brief (20-min) incubation of the procerebral lobe in 
      [32P]phosphate-containing medium. The level of synthesis of several proteins is 
      altered by serotonin, as determined by alterations in [35S]methionine incorporation 
      during a 20-min incubation. Serotonin also causes a slow accumulation of 
      inositoltrisphosphate. 4. Our study shows that within a short time (less than 20 
      min) serotonin can influence several second-messenger signaling systems and the 
      functional state and abundance of proteins in the procerebral lobe. These 
      serotonin-stimulated events should have direct consequences for intercellular 
      communication in the odor-processing network of the procerebral lobe.

AB  - Root-fungal symbioses such as mycorrhizas and endophytes are key components of 
      terrestrial ecosystems. Diverse in trophy habits (obligate, facultative or 
      hemi-biotrophs) and symbiotic relations (from mutualism to parasitism), these 
      associations also show great variability in their root colonization and nutritional 
      strategies. Specialized interface structures such as arbuscules and Hartig nets are 
      formed by certain associations while others are restricted to non-specialized 
      intercellular or intracellular hyphae in roots. In either case, there are documented 
      examples of active nutrient exchange, reinforcing the fact that specialized 
      structures used to define specific mycorrhizal associations are not essential for 
      reciprocal exchange of nutrients and plant growth promotion. In feremycorrhiza (with 
      Austroboletus occidentalis and eucalypts), the fungal partner markedly enhances 
      plant growth and nutrient acquisition without colonizing roots, emphasizing that a 
      conventional focus on structural form of associations may have resulted in important 
      functional components of rhizospheres being overlooked. In support of this 
      viewpoint, mycobiome studies using the state-of-the-art DNA sequencing technologies 
      have unearthed much more complexity in root-fungal relationships than those 
      discovered using the traditional morphology-based approaches. In this review, we 
      explore the existing literature and most recent findings surrounding structure, 
      functioning, and ecology of root-fungal symbiosis, which highlight the fact that 
      plant fitness can be altered by taxonomically/ecologically diverse fungal symbionts 
      regardless of root colonization and interface specialization. Furthermore, 
      transition from saprotrophy to biotrophy seems to be a common event that occurs in 
      diverse fungal lineages (consisting of root endophytes, soil saprotrophs, wood 
      decayers etc.), and which may be accompanied by development of specialized interface 
      structures and/or mycorrhiza-like effects on plant growth and nutrition.

AB  - Soil systems are being increasingly exposed to the interactive effects of biological 
      invasions and climate change, with rising temperatures expected to benefit alien 
      over indigenous species. We assessed this expectation for an important soil-dwelling 
      group, the springtails, by determining whether alien species show broader thermal 
      tolerance limits and greater tolerance to climate warming than their indigenous 
      counterparts. We found that, from the tropics to the sub-Antarctic, alien species 
      have the broadest thermal tolerances and greatest tolerance to environmental 
      warming. Both groups of species show little phenotypic plasticity or potential for 
      evolutionary change in tolerance to high temperature. These trait differences 
      between alien and indigenous species suggest that biological invasions will 
      exacerbate the impacts of climate change on soil systems, with profound implications 
      for terrestrial ecosystem functioning.

TI  - The Sphagnum microbiome supports bog ecosystem functioning under extreme conditions.
PG  - 4498-510
LID - 10.1111/mec.12885 [doi]
AB  - Sphagnum-dominated bogs represent a unique yet widely distributed type of 
      terrestrial ecosystem and strongly contribute to global biosphere functioning. 
      Sphagnum is colonized by highly diverse microbial communities, but less is known 
      about their function. We identified a high functional diversity within the Sphagnum 
      microbiome applying an Illumina-based metagenomic approach followed by de novo 
      assembly and MG-RAST annotation. An interenvironmental comparison revealed that the 
      Sphagnum microbiome harbours specific genetic features that distinguish it 
      significantly from microbiomes of higher plants and peat soils. The differential 
      traits especially support ecosystem functioning by a symbiotic lifestyle under 
      poikilohydric and ombrotrophic conditions. To realise a plasticity-stability 
      balance, we found abundant subsystems responsible to cope with oxidative and drought 
      stresses, to exchange (mobile) genetic elements, and genes that encode for 
      resistance to detrimental environmental factors, repair and self-controlling 
      mechanisms. Multiple microbe-microbe and plant-microbe interactions were also found 
      to play a crucial role as indicated by diverse genes necessary for biofilm 
      formation, interaction via quorum sensing and nutrient exchange. A high proportion 
      of genes involved in nitrogen cycle and recycling of organic material supported the 
      role of bacteria for nutrient supply. 16S rDNA analysis indicated a higher 
      structural diversity than that which had been previously detected using 
      PCR-dependent techniques. Altogether, the diverse Sphagnum microbiome has the 
      ability to support the life of the host plant and the entire ecosystem under 
      changing environmental conditions. Beyond this, the moss microbiome presents a 
      promising bio-resource for environmental biotechnology - with respect to novel 
      enzymes or stress-protecting bacteria.

TI  - The environmental plasticity and ecological genomics of the cyanobacterial CO2 
      concentrating mechanism.
PG  - 249-65
AB  - Cyanobacteria probably exhibit the widest range of diversity in growth habitats of 
      all photosynthetic organisms. They are found in cold and hot, alkaline and acidic, 
      marine, freshwater, saline, terrestrial, and symbiotic environments. In addition to 
      this, they originated on earth at least 2.5 billion years ago and have evolved 
      through periods of dramatic O2 increases, CO2 declines, and temperature changes. One 
      of the key problems they have faced through evolution and in their current 
      environments is the capture of CO2 and its efficient use by Rubisco in 
      photosynthesis. A central response to this challenge has been the development of a 
      CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) that can be adapted to various environmental 
      limitations. There are two primary functional elements of this CCM. Firstly, the 
      containment of Rubisco in carboxysome protein microbodies within the cell (the sites 
      of CO2) elevation), and, secondly, the presence of several inorganic carbon (Ci) 
      transporters that deliver HCO3- intracellularly. Cyanobacteria show both species 
      adaptation and acclimation of this mechanism. Between species, there are differences 
      in the suites of Ci transporters in each genome, the nature of the carboxysome 
      structures and the functional roles of carbonic anhydrases. Within a species, 
      different CCM activities can be induced depending on the Ci availability in the 
      environment. This acclimation is largely based on the induction of multiple Ci 
      transporters with different affinities and specificities for either CO2 or HCO3- as 
      substrates. These features are discussed in relation to our current knowledge of the 
      genomic sequences of a diverse array of cyanobacteria and their ecological 
      environments.

AB  - Phytoplankton have a complex life-cycle. Resting cysts are formed like terrestrial 
      plants. Cysts play important roles in resisting environmental pressure, surviving 
      adverse environment, maintaining physiological homeostasis, and maintaining species 
      reproduction. In some ecological events, cysts were served as "seed bank" for 
      periodical algal blooming. However, compared with the mature cells, the 
      ecophysiological research on cysts is relatively limited. To deepen our 
      understanding on life-cycle and ecological roles of cysts, we reviewed the 
      researches on cysts in the past two decades. Firstly, we outlined the types (resting 
      cysts, zoocysts, mature cysts) and factors that affected the formation of cysts of 
      typical dinoflagellates and diatoms. Secondly, we summarized the formation 
      mechanism, physiological characteristics and germination factors of cysts. Finally, 
      we discussed the significance of cysts in algal evolution and in ocean carbon cycle. 
      This review, summarizing the adaptability and plasticity of cysts, would shed light 
      on ecological mechanism of algae survival strategy.

AB  - Detailed, precise, three-dimensional (3D) representations of individual trees are a 
      prerequisite for an accurate assessment of tree competition, growth, and 
      morphological plasticity. Until recently, our ability to measure the dimensionality, 
      spatial arrangement, shape of trees, and shape of tree components with precision has 
      been constrained by technological and logistical limitations and cost. Traditional 
      methods of forest biometrics provide only partial measurements and are labor 
      intensive. Active remote technologies such as LiDAR operated from airborne platforms 
      provide only partial crown reconstructions. The use of terrestrial LiDAR is 
      laborious, has portability limitations and high cost. In this work we capitalized on 
      recent improvements in the capabilities and availability of small unmanned aerial 
      vehicles (UAVs), light and inexpensive cameras, and developed an affordable method 
      for obtaining precise and comprehensive 3D models of trees and small groups of 
      trees. The method employs slow-moving UAVs that acquire images along predefined 
      trajectories near and around targeted trees, and computer vision-based approaches 
      that process the images to obtain detailed tree reconstructions. After we confirmed 
      the potential of the methodology via simulation we evaluated several UAV platforms, 
      strategies for image acquisition, and image processing algorithms. We present an 
      original, step-by-step workflow which utilizes open source programs and original 
      software. We anticipate that future development and applications of our method will 
      improve our understanding of forest self-organization emerging from the competition 
      among trees, and will lead to a refined generation of individual-tree-based forest 
      models.

TI  - Morphological evolution of spiders predicted by pendulum mechanics.
PG  - e1841
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0001841 [doi]
LID - e1841
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animals have been hypothesized to benefit from pendulum mechanics during 
      suspensory locomotion, in which the potential energy of gravity is converted into 
      kinetic energy according to the energy-conservation principle. However, no 
      convincing evidence has been found so far. Demonstrating that morphological 
      evolution follows pendulum mechanics is important from a biomechanical point of view 
      because during suspensory locomotion some morphological traits could be decoupled 
      from gravity, thus allowing independent adaptive morphological evolution of these 
      two traits when compared to animals that move standing on their legs; i.e., as 
      inverted pendulums. If the evolution of body shape matches simple pendulum 
      mechanics, animals that move suspending their bodies should evolve relatively longer 
      legs which must confer high moving capabilities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We 
      tested this hypothesis in spiders, a group of diverse terrestrial generalist 
      predators in which suspensory locomotion has been lost and gained a few times 
      independently during their evolutionary history. In spiders that hang upside-down 
      from their webs, their legs have evolved disproportionately longer relative to their 
      body sizes when compared to spiders that move standing on their legs. In addition, 
      we show how disproportionately longer legs allow spiders to run faster during 
      suspensory locomotion and how these same spiders run at a slower speed on the ground 
      (i.e., as inverted pendulums). Finally, when suspensory spiders are induced to run 
      on the ground, there is a clear trend in which larger suspensory spiders tend to run 
      much more slowly than similar-size spiders that normally move as inverted pendulums 
      (i.e., wandering spiders). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Several lines of evidence 
      support the hypothesis that spiders have evolved according to the predictions of 
      pendulum mechanics. These findings have potentially important ecological and 
      evolutionary implications since they could partially explain the occurrence of 
      foraging plasticity and dispersal constraints as well as the evolution of sexual 
      size dimorphism and sociality.

TI  - Nitrogen:phosphorous supply ratio and allometry in five alpine plant species.
PG  - 8881-8892
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2587 [doi]
AB  - In terrestrial ecosystems, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has greatly increased 
      N availability relative to other elements, particularly phosphorus (P). Alterations 
      in the availability of N relative to P can affect plant growth rate and functional 
      traits, as well as resource allocation to above- versus belowground biomass (M(A) 
      and M(B)). Biomass allocation among individual plants is broadly size-dependent, and 
      this can often be described as an allometric relationship between M(A) and M(B), as 
      represented by the equation MA=αMBβ, or log M(A) = logα + βlog M(B). Here, we 
      investigated whether the scaling exponent or regression slope may be affected by the 
      N:P supply ratio. We hypothesized that the regression slope between M(A) and M(B) 
      should be steeper under a high N:P supply ratio due to P limitation, and shallower 
      under a low N:P supply ratio due to N limitation. To test these hypotheses, we 
      experimentally altered the levels of N, P, and the N:P supply ratio (from 1.7:1 to 
      135:1) provided to five alpine species representing two functional groups (grasses 
      and composite forbs) under greenhouse conditions; we then measured the effects of 
      these treatments on plant morphology and tissue content (SLA, leaf area, and leaf 
      and root N/P concentrations) and on the scaling relationship between M(A) and M(B). 
      Unbalanced N:P supply ratios generally negatively affected plant biomass, leaf area, 
      and tissue nutrient concentration in both grasses and composite forbs. High N:P 
      ratios increased tissue N:P ratios in both functional groups, but more in the two 
      composite forbs than in the grasses. The positive regression slopes between log M(A) 
      and log M(B) exhibited by plants raised under a N:P supply ratio of 135:1 were 
      significantly steeper than those observed under the N:P ratio of 1.7:1 and 15:1. 
      SYNTHESIS: Plant biomass allocation is highly plastic in response to variation in 
      the N:P supply ratio. Studies of resource allocation of individual plants should 
      focus on the effects of nutrient ratios as well as the availability of individual 
      elements. The two forb species were more sensitive than grasses to unbalanced N:P 
      supplies. To evaluate the adaptive significance of this plasticity, the effects of 
      unbalanced N:P supply ratio on individual lifetime fitness must be measured.

AB  - Local neighbourhood interactions are considered a main driver for 
      biodiversity-productivity relationships in forests. Yet, the structural responses of 
      individual trees in species mixtures and their relation to crown complementarity 
      remain poorly understood. Using a large-scale forest experiment, we studied the 
      impact of local tree species richness and structural variability on above-ground 
      wood volume allocation patterns and crown morphology. We applied terrestrial laser 
      scanning to capture the three-dimensional structure of trees and their temporal 
      dynamics. We found that crown complementarity and crown plasticity increased with 
      species richness. Trees growing in species-rich neighbourhoods showed enhanced 
      aboveground wood volume both in trunks and branches. Over time, neighbourhood 
      diversity induced shifts in wood volume allocation in favour of branches, in 
      particular for morphologically flexible species. Our results demonstrate that 
      diversity-mediated shifts in allocation pattern and crown morphology are a 
      fundamental mechanism for crown complementarity and may be an important driver of 
      overyielding.

TI  - When water interacts with temperature: Ecological and evolutionary implications of 
      thermo-hydroregulation in terrestrial ectotherms.
PG  - 10029-10043
LID - 10.1002/ece3.5440 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of body temperature (thermoregulation) and of water balance (defined 
      here as hydroregulation) are key processes underlying ecological and evolutionary 
      responses to climate fluctuations in wild animal populations. In terrestrial (or 
      semiterrestrial) ectotherms, thermoregulation and hydroregulation closely interact 
      and combined temperature and water constraints should directly influence individual 
      performances. Although comparative physiologists traditionally investigate jointly 
      water and temperature regulation, the ecological and evolutionary implications of 
      these coupled processes have so far mostly been studied independently. Here, we 
      revisit the concept of thermo-hydroregulation to address the functional integration 
      of body temperature and water balance regulation in terrestrial ectotherms. We 
      demonstrate how thermo-hydroregulation provides a framework to investigate 
      functional adaptations to joint environmental variation in temperature and water 
      availability, and potential physiological and/or behavioral conflicts between 
      thermoregulation and hydroregulation. We extend the classical cost-benefit model of 
      thermoregulation in ectotherms to highlight the adaptive evolution of optimal 
      thermo-hydroregulation strategies. Critical gaps in the parameterization of this 
      conceptual optimality model and guidelines for future empirical research are 
      discussed. We show that studies of thermo-hydroregulation refine our mechanistic 
      understanding of physiological and behavioral plasticity, and of the fundamental 
      niche of the species. This is illustrated with relevant and recent examples of space 
      use and dispersal, resource-based trade-offs, and life-history tactics in insects, 
      amphibians, and nonavian reptiles.

AB  - Behavioural plasticity during habitat selection plays a key role in determining 
      whether organisms may thrive under human-induced rapid environmental changes. As 
      organisms rely on environmental cues to make decisions, these behavioural responses 
      may be maladaptive. We studied the European stonechat Saxicola torquatus as a model 
      open-habitat bird species breeding in three structurally different land-use types 
      generated by agriculture and forestry activities. In this mosaic landscape, we 
      compared the relative attractiveness and the breeding habitat quality of intensive 
      grassland, Christmas tree plantations and clear-cut patches in plantation forests to 
      test whether habitat selection was adaptive. We examined the settlement pattern of 
      territorial males to evaluate habitat preference. We recorded key parameters 
      reflecting reproductive performances, adult and first-year survival to estimate the 
      individual fitness of the birds and assess the quality of the different land-use 
      types for breeding. Stonechats preferentially settled in clear-cut patches, but 
      their fitness was not found to be markedly different in comparison with the other 
      occupied habitats. Although they produced slightly lower-quality offspring in 
      clear-cut patches, we did not find a negative consequence on first-year survival 
      probabilities or any among-habitat differences in adult survival. With our analysis 
      integrating multiple components of individual fitness, we show that all occupied 
      land-use types are similarly rewarding for the breeding stonechats. Our study shows 
      that some species can benefit from novel land-use types emerging in the landscape as 
      a result of human activities. Flexible habitat selection in the stonechat has most 
      probably contributed to its recent population increase in Western Europe.

      Implications of input from coastal currents.

AB  - Coastal beaches are a vital transitional zone in which terrestrial microplastics 
      (MPs) enter the oceans. However, little is known about the impact of coastal 
      currents on the dispersion and accumulation of MPs, especially in semi-enclosed 
      bays. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the spatiotemporal variation of 
      MPs in the coastal sediments of Haizhou Bay. The abundance of MPs ranged from 10.94 
      n/kg to 1309.02 n/kg. Overall, a higher amount of MPs was found in intertidal 
      sediment than in the supratidal zone. Significant seasonal variation was observed 
      only in the intertidal areas of Haizhou Bay, suggesting that hydrodynamics plays a 
      critical role shaping MP abundance. Statistical analyses revealed a roughly 
      exponential increase of MP abundance with distance from the coast, and that a 
      relatively higher abundance of MPs would be found at offshore sites in downstream 
      areas. These results suggest that coastal currents are important contributors of 
      MPs. A numerical model of vertical profiles estimated the total inventory of MPs in 
      coastal areas to be 13.83-580 trillion pieces. Our results suggest a neglected sink 
      of MPs in the sedimentary environments of coastal regions. As a result, the amount 
      of MPs in coastal regions in previous studies could have been underestimated.

AB  - Seasonal cycles govern life on earth, from setting the time for the mating season to 
      influencing migrations and governing physiological conditions like hibernation. The 
      effect of such changing conditions on behavior is well-appreciated, but their impact 
      on the brain remains virtually unknown. We investigate long-term seasonal changes in 
      the mammalian brain, known as Dehnel's effect, where animals exhibit plasticity in 
      body and brain sizes to counter metabolic demands in winter. We find large seasonal 
      variation in cellular architecture and neuronal activity in the smallest terrestrial 
      mammal, the Etruscan shrew, Suncus etruscus Their brain, and specifically their 
      neocortex, shrinks in winter. Shrews are tactile hunters, and information from 
      whiskers first reaches the somatosensory cortex layer 4, which exhibits a reduced 
      width (-28%) in winter. Layer 4 width (+29%) and neuron number (+42%) increase the 
      following summer. Activity patterns in the somatosensory cortex show a prominent 
      reduction of touch-suppressed neurons in layer 4 (-55%), the most metabolically 
      active layer. Loss of inhibitory gating occurs with a reduction in 
      parvalbumin-positive interneurons, one of the most active neuronal subtypes and the 
      main regulators of inhibition in layer 4. Thus, a reduction in neurons in layer 4 
      and particularly parvalbumin-positive interneurons may incur direct metabolic 
      benefits. However, changes in cortical balance can also affect the threshold for 
      detecting sensory stimuli and impact prey choice, as observed in wild shrews. Thus, 
      seasonal neural adaptation can offer synergistic metabolic and behavioral benefits 
      to the organism and offer insights on how neural systems show adaptive plasticity in 
      response to ecological demands.

AB  - Terrestrial soils are not only a large reservoir for Microplastics (MPs), but also a 
      possible entrance to the subsurface environment, posing potential risks to the 
      subterranean habitats and groundwater. In this study, we examined the vertical 
      transport of MPs of four polymers, i.e., polyethylene (PE), polyethylene 
      terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and polyamide (PA), in porous sand media 
      driven by wet-dry cycling. The effects of polymer properties, MP size, sand particle 
      size, wet-dry cycles, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on their migration behavior 
      were investigated. Surface hydrophobicity showed a strong positive correlation with 
      MP mobility, with PA exhibiting the greatest movement potential, followed by PE, 
      PET, and PP. The penetration depth of MP particles increased with decreasing MP 
      particle size (d(MP)) and increasing sand diameter (d(sand)). MP particles migrated 
      deeper in sand media when d(MP)/d(sand) < 0.11. Furthermore, frequent wet-dry cycles 
      and the presence of DOM promoted the vertical migration of MPs in the sand. The 
      results revealed multiple factors influencing the vertical migration of MPs in sand, 
      which is instructive for understanding the ecological risk of MPs in potentially 
      contaminated soil (e.g., farmland with long-term mulching) to the subsurface 
      environment and potential negative impact to public health.

TI  - Urbanization alters plastic responses in the common dandelion Taraxacum officinale.
PG  - 4082-4090
LID - 10.1002/ece3.6176 [doi]
AB  - Urban environments expose species to contrasting selection pressures relative to 
      rural areas due to altered microclimatic conditions, habitat fragmentation, and 
      changes in species interactions. To improve our understanding on how urbanization 
      impacts selection through biotic interactions, we assessed differences in plant 
      defense and tolerance, dispersal, and flowering phenology of a common plant species 
      (Taraxacum officinale) along an urbanization gradient and their reaction norms in 
      response to a biotic stressor (i.e., herbivory). We raised plants from 45 lines 
      collected along an urbanization gradient under common garden conditions and assessed 
      the impact of herbivory on plant growth (i.e., aboveground biomass), dispersal 
      capacity (i.e., seed morphology), and plant phenology (i.e., early seed production) 
      by exposing half of our plants to two events of herbivory (i.e., grazing by 
      locusts). Independent from their genetic background, all plants consistently 
      increased their resistance to herbivores by which the second exposure to locusts 
      resulted in lower levels of damage suffered. Herbivory had consistent effects on 
      seed pappus length, with seeds showing a longer pappus (and, hence, increased 
      dispersal capacities) regardless of urbanization level. Aboveground plant biomass 
      was neither affected by urbanization nor herbivore presence. In contrast to 
      consistent responses in plant defenses and pappus length, plant fitness did vary 
      between lines. Urban lines had a reduced early seed production following herbivory 
      while rural and suburban lines did not show any plastic response. Our results show 
      that herbivory affects plant phenotypes but more importantly that differences in 
      herbivory reaction norms exist between urban and rural populations.

TI  - An instrument to measure mechanical up-conversion phenomena in metals in the elastic 
      regime.
PG  - 065107
LID - 10.1063/1.4953114 [doi]
AB  - Crystalline materials, such as metals, are known to exhibit deviation from a simple 
      linear relation between strain and stress when the latter exceeds the yield stress. 
      In addition, it has been shown that metals respond to varying external stress in a 
      discontinuous way in this regime, exhibiting discrete releases of energy. This 
      crackling noise has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically 
      when the metals are operating in the plastic regime. In our study, we focus on the 
      behavior of metals in the elastic regime, where the stresses are well below the 
      yield stress. We describe an instrument that aims to characterize non-linear 
      mechanical noise in metals when stressed in the elastic regime. In macroscopic 
      systems, this phenomenon is expected to manifest as a non-stationary noise modulated 
      by external disturbances applied to the material, a form of mechanical up-conversion 
      of noise. The main motivation for this work is for the case of maraging steel 
      components (cantilevers and wires) in the suspension systems of terrestrial 
      gravitational wave detectors. Such instruments are planned to reach very ambitious 
      displacement sensitivities, and therefore mechanical noise in the cantilevers could 
      prove to be a limiting factor for the detectors' final sensitivities, mainly due to 
      non-linear up-conversion of low frequency residual seismic motion to the frequencies 
      of interest for the gravitational wave observations. We describe here the 
      experimental setup, with a target sensitivity of 10(-15) m/Hz in the frequency range 
      of 10-1000 Hz, a simple phenomenological model of the non-linear mechanical noise, 
      and the analysis method that is inspired by this model.

TI  - A Standardized Protocol for Preference Testing to Assess Fish Welfare.
LID - 10.3791/60674 [doi]
AB  - Animal welfare assessment techniques try to take into consideration the specific 
      needs and wants of the animal in question. Providing enrichment (the addition of 
      physical objects or conspecifics in the housing environment) is often a way to give 
      captive animals the opportunity to choose who or what they interact with and how 
      they spend their time. A fundamental component of the aquatic environment that is 
      often overlooked in captivity, however, is the ability for the animal to choose to 
      engage in physical exercise. For many animals, including fish, exercise is an 
      important aspect of their life history, and is known to have many health benefits, 
      including positive changes in the brain and behavior. Here we present a method for 
      assessing habitat preferences in captive animals. The protocol could easily be 
      adapted to look at a variety of environmental factors (e.g., gravel versus sand as a 
      substrate, plastic plants versus live plants, low flow versus high flow of water) in 
      different aquatic species, or for use with terrestrial species. Statistical 
      assessment of preference is carried out using Jacob's preference index, which ranks 
      the habitats from -1 (avoidance) to +1 (most preferred). With this information, it 
      can be determined what the animal wants from a welfare perspective, including their 
      preferred location.

PG  - 299-311
LID - 10.1007/s00442-016-3555-z [doi]
AB  - Protection provided by shelter is important for survival and affects the time and 
      energy budgets of animals. It has been suggested that in fresh waters at high 
      latitudes and altitudes, surface ice during winter functions as overhead cover for 
      fish, reducing the predation risk from terrestrial piscivores. We simulated ice 
      cover by suspending plastic sheeting over five 30-m-long stream sections in a boreal 
      forest stream and examined its effects on the growth and habitat use of brown trout 
      (Salmo trutta) during winter. Trout that spent the winter under the artificial ice 
      cover grew more than those in the control (uncovered) sections. Moreover, tracking 
      of trout tagged with passive integrated transponders showed that in the absence of 
      the artificial ice cover, habitat use during the day was restricted to the stream 
      edges, often under undercut banks, whereas under the simulated ice cover condition, 
      trout used the entire width of the stream. These results indicate that the presence 
      of surface ice cover may improve the energetic status and broaden habitat use of 
      stream fish during winter. It is therefore likely that reductions in the duration 
      and extent of ice cover due to climate change will alter time and energy budgets, 
      with potentially negative effects on fish production.

      Australian passerines.
PG  - 3845-52
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2009.1011 [doi]
AB  - Intraspecific latitudinal clines in the body size of terrestrial vertebrates, where 
      members of the same species are larger at higher latitudes, are widely interpreted 
      as evidence for natural selection and adaptation to local climate. These clines are 
      predicted to shift in response to climate change. We used museum specimens to 
      measure changes in the body size of eight passerine bird species from south-eastern 
      Australia over approximately the last 100 years. Four species showed significant 
      decreases in body size (1.8-3.6% of wing length) and a shift in latitudinal cline 
      over that period, and a meta-analysis demonstrated a consistent trend across all 
      eight species. Southern high-latitude populations now display the body sizes typical 
      of more northern populations pre-1950, equivalent to a 7 degrees shift in latitude. 
      Using ptilochronology, we found no evidence that these morphological changes were a 
      plastic response to changes in nutrition, a likely non-genetic mechanism for the 
      pattern observed. Our results demonstrate a generalized response by eight avian 
      species to some major environmental change over the last 100 years or so, probably 
      global warming.

TI  - Multiple behavioural, morphological and cognitive developmental changes arise from a 
      single alteration to early life spatial environment, resulting in fitness 
      consequences for released pheasants.
PG  - 160008
LID - 10.1098/rsos.160008 [doi]
LID - 160008
AB  - Subtle variations in early rearing environment influence morphological, cognitive 
      and behavioural processes that together impact on adult fitness. We manipulated 
      habitat complexity experienced by young pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) in their 
      first seven weeks, adding a third accessible dimension by placing elevated perches 
      in their rearing pens mimicking natural variation in habitat complexity. This simple 
      manipulation provoked an interrelated suite of morphological, cognitive and 
      behavioural changes, culminating in decreased wild mortality of birds from complex 
      habitats compared with controls. Three mechanisms contribute to this: Pheasants 
      reared with perches had a morphology which could enable them to fly to the higher 
      branches and cope with prolonged roosting. They had a higher propensity to roost off 
      the ground at night in the wild. More generally, these birds had more accurate 
      spatial memory. Consequently, birds were at a reduced risk of terrestrial predation. 
      The fitness consequences of variation in early rearing on behavioural development 
      are rarely studied in the wild but we show that this is necessary because the 
      effects can be broad ranging and not simple, depending on a complex interplay of 
      behavioural, cognitive and morphological elements, even when effects that the 
      treatments provoke are relatively short term and plastic.

TI  - Experimental assessment of ozone risk on ecotypes of the tropical tree Moringa 
      oleifera.

AB  - Ozone (O(3)) is an oxidative air pollutant that affects plant growth. Moringa 
      oleifera is a tree species distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions. This 
      species presents high morphological plasticity, which increases its ability to 
      tolerate stressful conditions, but with no O(3) risk assessment calculated so far. 
      The present study assessed the O(3) risk to different M. oleifera ecotypes using 
      exposure-based index (AOT40) or flux-based index (PODy - where y is a threshold of 
      O(3) uptake). PODy considers the O(3) uptake through the stomata and the consequence 
      of environmental climate conditions on stomatal conductance (g(sto)); thus, it is 
      efficient in assessing O(3) risk. Five M. oleifera ecotypes were subjected to 
      ambient (Amb.); middle (Mid. X1.5), and High (x2.0) O(3) concentrations for 77 days 
      in a free-air controlled exposure facility (FACE). Leaf biomass (LB) was evaluated, 
      and the biomass loss was projected assuming a clean atmosphere (10 ppb as 24 h O(3) 
      average). The g(sto) parameterization was calculated using the Jarvis-type 
      multiplicative algorithm considering several climate factors, i.e., light intensity, 
      air temperature, air vapor pressure deficit, and AOT40. Ozone exposure harmed the LB 
      of all ecotypes. The high g(sto) (~559 mmol H(2)O m(-2) s(-1)) can be considered the 
      reason for the species' O(3) sensitivity. M. oleifera is adapted to hot climate 
      conditions, and g(sto) was restricted with air temperature (T(min)) below ~ 9 °C. As 
      expected, the PODy index performed better than the AOT40 for estimating the O(3) 
      effect on biomass losses. We recommend a y threshold of 4 nmol m(-2) s(-1) to 
      incorporate O(3) effects on M. oleifera LB. To not exceed a 4% reduction of LB for 
      any M. oleifera genotype, we recommend the critical levels of 1.1 mmol m(-2) POD(4).

TI  - Horn growth variation and hunting selection of the Alpine ibex.
PG  - 1069-1079
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12839 [doi]
AB  - Selective hunting can affect demographic characteristics and phenotypic traits of 
      the targeted species. Hunting systems often involve harvesting quotas based on sex, 
      age and/or size categories to avoid selective pressure. However, it is difficult to 
      assess whether such regulations deter hunters from targeting larger "trophy" animals 
      with longer horns that may have evolutionary consequences. Here, we compile 44,088 
      annually resolved and absolutely dated measurements of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) horn 
      growth increments from 8,355 males, harvested between 1978 and 2013, in the eastern 
      Swiss Canton of Grisons. We aim to determine whether male ibex with longer horns 
      were preferentially targeted, causing animals with early rapid horn growth to have 
      shorter lives, and whether such hunting selection translated into long-term trends 
      in horn size over the past four decades. Results show that medium- to longer-horned 
      adult males had a higher probability of being harvested than shorter-horned 
      individuals of the same age and that regulations do affect the hunters' behaviour. 
      Nevertheless, phenotypic traits such as horn length, as well as body size and 
      weight, remained stable over the study period. Although selective trophy hunting 
      still occurs, it did not cause a measurable evolutionary response in Grisons' Alpine 
      ibex populations; managed and surveyed since 1978. Nevertheless, further research is 
      needed to understand whether phenotypic trait development is coinfluenced by other, 
      potentially compensatory factors that may possibly mask the effects of selective, 
      long-term hunting pressure.

TI  - The Genome of the Self-Fertilizing Mangrove Rivulus Fish, Kryptolebias marmoratus: A 
      Model for Studying Phenotypic Plasticity and Adaptations to Extreme Environments.
PG  - 2145-54
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evw145 [doi]
AB  - The mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) is one of two preferentially 
      self-fertilizing hermaphroditic vertebrates. This mode of reproduction makes 
      mangrove rivulus an important model for evolutionary and biomedical studies because 
      long periods of self-fertilization result in naturally homozygous genotypes that can 
      produce isogenic lineages without significant limitations associated with inbreeding 
      depression. Over 400 isogenic lineages currently held in laboratories across the 
      globe show considerable among-lineage variation in physiology, behavior, and life 
      history traits that is maintained under common garden conditions. Temperature 
      mediates the development of primary males and also sex change between hermaphrodites 
      and secondary males, which makes the system ideal for the study of sex determination 
      and sexual plasticity. Mangrove rivulus also exhibit remarkable adaptations to 
      living in extreme environments, and the system has great promise to shed light on 
      the evolution of terrestrial locomotion, aerial respiration, and broad tolerances to 
      hypoxia, salinity, temperature, and environmental pollutants. Genome assembly of the 
      mangrove rivulus allows the study of genes and gene families associated with the 
      traits described above. Here we present a de novo assembled reference genome for the 
      mangrove rivulus, with an approximately 900 Mb genome, including 27,328 annotated, 
      predicted, protein-coding genes. Moreover, we are able to place more than 50% of the 
      assembled genome onto a recently published linkage map. The genome provides an 
      important addition to the linkage map and transcriptomic tools recently developed 
      for this species that together provide critical resources for epigenetic, 
      transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Moreover, the genome will serve as the 
      foundation for addressing key questions in behavior, physiology, toxicology, and 
      evolutionary biology.

PG  - 247-62
LID - 10.1159/000127045 [doi]
AB  - Growth-associated protein-43 is typically expressed at high levels in the nervous 
      system during development. In adult animals, its expression is lower, but still 
      observable in brain areas showing structural or functional plasticity. We examined 
      patterns of GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the brain of the bullfrog, an animal whose 
      nervous system undergoes considerable reorganization across metamorphic development 
      and retains a strong capacity for plasticity in adulthood. Immunolabeling was mostly 
      diffuse in hatchling tadpoles, but became progressively more discrete as larval 
      development proceeded. In many brain areas, intensity of immunolabel peaked at 
      metamorphic climax, the time of final transition from aquatic to semi-terrestrial 
      life. Changes in intensity of GAP-43 expression in the medial vestibular nucleus, 
      superior olivary nucleus, and torus semicircularis appeared correlated with 
      stage-dependent functional changes in processing auditory stimuli. Immunolabeling in 
      the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and in the cerebellar nucleus was 
      detectable at most developmental time points. Heavy immunolabel was present from 
      early larval stages through the end of climax in the thalamus (ventromedial, 
      anterior, posterior, central nuclei). Immunolabel in the tadpole telencephalon was 
      observed around the lateral ventricles, and in the medial septum and ventral 
      striatum. In postmetamorphic animals, immunoreactivity was confined mainly to the 
      ventricular zones and immediately adjacent cell layers. GAP-43 expression was 
      present in olfactory, auditory and optic cranial nerves throughout larval and 
      postmetamorphic life. The continued expression of GAP-43 in brain nuclei and in 
      cranial nerves throughout development and into adulthood reflects the high 
      regenerative potential of the bullfrog's central nervous system.

      municipal solid waste anaerobic digestion plants: Comparison of wet and dry process 
      layout.
PG  - 84-97

AB  - Anaerobic digestion of source separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste is 
      an increasing waste valorization alternative instead of incineration or landfilling 
      of untreated biodegradable wastes. Nevertheless, a significant portion of 
      biodegradable wastes entering the plant is lost in pre-treatments and 
      post-treatments of anaerobic digestion facilities together with other improper 
      materials such as plastics, paper, textile materials and metals. The rejected 
      materials lost in these stages have two main implications: (i) less organic material 
      enters to digesters and, as a consequence, there is a loss of biogas production and 
      (ii) the rejected materials end up in landfills or incinerators contributing to 
      environmental impacts such as global warming or eutrophication. The main goals of 
      this study are (i) to estimate potential losses of biogas in the rejected solid 
      materials generated during the pre- and post-treatments of two full-scale anaerobic 
      digestion facilities and (ii) to evaluate the environmental burdens associated to 
      the final disposal (landfill or incineration) of these rejected materials by means 
      of Life Cycle Assessment. This study shows that there is a lost of potential biogas 
      production, ranging from 8% to 15%, due to the loss of organic matter during 
      pre-treatment stages in anaerobic digestion facilities. From an environmental point 
      of view, the Life Cycle Assessment shows that the incineration scenario is the most 
      favorable alternative for eight out of nine impact categories compared with the 
      landfill scenario. The studied impact categories are Climate Change, Fossil 
      depletion, Freshwater eutrophication, Marine eutrophication, Ozone depletion, 
      Particulate matter formation, Photochemical oxidant formation, Terrestrial 
      acidification and Water depletion.

AB  - When the habitat occupied by a specialist species is patchily distributed, limited 
      gene flow between the fragmented populations may allow population differentiation 
      and eventual speciation. 'Sky islands'-montane habitats that form terrestrial 
      islands-have been shown to promote diversification in many taxa through this 
      mechanism. We investigate floral variation in Impatiens lawii, a plant specialized 
      on laterite rich rocky plateaus that form sky islands in the northern Western Ghats 
      mountains of India. We focus on three plateaus separated from each other by ca. 7 to 
      17 km, and show that floral traits have diverged strongly between these populations. 
      In contrast, floral traits have not diverged in the congeneric I. oppositifolia, 
      which co-occurs with I. lawii in the plateaus, but is a habitat generalist that is 
      also found in the intervening valleys. We conducted common garden experiments to 
      test whether the differences in I. lawii are due to genetic differentiation or 
      phenotypic plasticity. There were strong differences in floral morphology between 
      experimental plants sourced from the three populations, and the relative divergences 
      between population pairs mirrored that seen in the wild, indicating that the 
      populations are genetically differentiated. Common garden experiments confirmed that 
      there was no differentiation in I. oppositifolia. Field floral visitation surveys 
      indicated that the observed differences in floral traits have consequences for I. 
      lawii populations, by reducing the number of visitors and changing the relative 
      abundance of different floral visitor groups. Our results highlight the role of 
      habitat specialization in diversification, and corroborates the importance of sky 
      islands as centres of diversification.

AB  - It remains poorly understood how effects of anthropogenic activity, such as 
      large-scale habitat fragmentation, impact sociality in animals. In cooperatively 
      breeding species, groups are mostly formed through delayed offspring dispersal, and 
      habitat fragmentation can affect this process in two opposite directions. Increased 
      habitat isolation may increase dispersal costs, promoting delayed dispersal. 
      Alternatively, reduced patch size and quality may decrease benefits of philopatry, 
      promoting dispersal. Here, we test both predictions in a cooperatively breeding bird 
      (placid greenbul, Phyllastrephus placidus) from an Afrotropical cloud forest 
      archipelago. Males born in fragmented forest dispersed about 1 year earlier than 
      those born in continuous forest. Contrary to females, males also started to 
      reproduce earlier and mostly settled within their natal patch. Females only rarely 
      delayed their dispersal for more than 1 year, both in fragmented and continuous 
      forests. Our results suggest that early male dispersal and reproduction is jointly 
      driven by a decrease in the value of the natal territory and an increase in local 
      breeding opportunities in fragmented forest. While plasticity in dispersal 
      strategies of cooperative breeders in response to anthropogenic change is believed 
      to optimize reproduction-survival trade-offs, to what extent it shapes the ability 
      of species to respond to rapid environmental change remains to be studied.

TI  - Interspecific Larval Competition Differentially Impacts Adult Survival in Dengue 
      Vectors.
PG  - 163-70
LID - 10.1093/jme/tju062 [doi]
AB  - Mosquitoes often experience intraspecific and interspecific competition among larvae 
      attributable to high densities and nutrient limitation, especially container 
      mosquitoes including Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse). 
      Density-dependent effects on larvae impact adult production and adult traits that 
      influence transmission of arboviruses. To improve our understanding of the 
      mechanisms by which density-dependence influences transmission and identify 
      species-specific traits, we tested the hypotheses: 1) Competitive asymmetry in favor 
      of Ae. albopictus over Ae. aegypti translates to altered adult female survival, and 
      2) Ae. aegypti adult females are more resistant to life-shortening effects of 
      low-humidity conditions than Ae. albopictus. We gauged the relative impact of inter- 
      and intraspecific larval competition on adult survival in high- and low-humidity 
      regimes (77 and 44% relative humidity, respectively). For Ae. albopictus, 
      intraspecific but not interspecific competition usually reduced adult survival under 
      both humidity regimes. For Ae. aegypti, both intraspecific and interspecific 
      competition reduced adult survival. Ae. albopictus adult survival was minimally 
      influenced by interspecific competition with Ae. aegypti, consistent with 
      observations that Ae. albopictus is the superior competitor. A species comparison 
      indicated that Ae. aegypti exhibited a survival advantage relative to Ae. albopictus 
      under both low- and high-humidity conditions. However, similar survival of these 
      Aedes species was observed in some cases depending on conditions experienced in both 
      the aquatic and terrestrial environments. These results demonstrate plasticity in 
      survival rates of dengue and chikungunya vectors and the significance of considering 
      the influence of biological interactions during the immature stages and abiotic 
      conditions during the adult stage.

TI  - A novel "four-component" two-component signal transduction mechanism regulates 
      developmental progression in Myxococcus xanthus.
PG  - 21435-45
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M109.033415 [doi]
AB  - Histidine-aspartate phosphorelays are employed by two-component signal transduction 
      family proteins to mediate responses to specific signals or stimuli in 
      microorganisms and plants. The RedCDEF proteins constitute a novel signaling system 
      in which four two-component proteins comprising a histidine kinase, a 
      histidine-kinase like protein, and two response regulators function together to 
      regulate progression through the elaborate developmental program of Myxococcus 
      xanthus. A combination of in vivo phenotypic analyses of in-frame deletions and 
      non-functional point mutations in each gene as well as in vitro autophosphorylation 
      and phosphotransfer analyses of recombinant proteins indicate that the RedC 
      histidine kinase protein autophosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to the 
      single domain response regulator, RedF, to repress progression through the 
      developmental program. To relieve this developmental repression, RedC instead 
      phosphorylates RedD, a dual receiver response regulator protein. Surprisingly, RedD 
      transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine kinase-like protein RedE, which 
      itself appears to be incapable of autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RedE may 
      render RedE accessible to RedF, where it removes the phosphoryl group from RedF-P, 
      which is otherwise an unusually stable phosphoprotein. These analyses reveal a novel 
      "four-component" signaling mechanism that has probably arisen to temporally 
      coordinate signals controlling the developmental program in M. xanthus. The RedCDEF 
      signaling system provides an important example of how the inherent plasticity and 
      modularity of the basic two-component signaling domains comprise a highly adaptable 
      framework well suited to expansion into complex signaling mechanisms.

TI  - Recording the free-living behaviour of small-bodied, shallow-diving animals with 
      data loggers.
PG  - 183-90
AB  - 1. Time-depth data recorders (TDRs) have been widely used to explore the behaviour 
      of relatively large, deep divers. However, little is known about the dive behaviour 
      of small, shallow divers such as semi-aquatic mammals. 2. We used high-resolution 
      TDRs to record the diving behaviour of American mink Mustela vison (weight of 
      individuals 580-1275 g) in rivers in Oxfordshire (UK) between December 2005 and 
      March 2006. 3. Dives to > 0.2 m were measured in all individuals (n = 6). Modal dive 
      depth and duration were 0.3 m and 10 s, respectively, although dives up to 3 m and 
      60 s in duration were recorded. Dive duration increased with dive depth. 4. 
      Temperature data recorded by TDRs covaried with diving behaviour: they were 
      relatively cold (modal temperature 4-6 degrees C across individuals) when mink were 
      diving and relatively warm (modal temperature 24-36 degrees C across individuals) 
      when mink were not diving. 5. Individuals differed hugely in their use of rivers, 
      reflecting foraging plasticity across both terrestrial and aquatic environments. For 
      some individuals there was < 1 dive per day while for others there was > 100 dives 
      per day. 6. We have shown it is now possible to record the diving behaviour of small 
      free-living animals that only dive a few tens of centimetres, opening up the way for 
      a new range of TDR studies on shallow diving species.

AB  - The effects of hypergravity (HG) on soleus and plantaris muscles were studied in 
      Long Evans rats aged 100 days, born and reared in 2-g conditions (HG group). The 
      morphological and contractile properties and the myosin heavy chain (MHC) content 
      were examined in whole muscles and compared with terrestrial control (Cont) 
      age-paired rats. The growth of HG rats was slowed compared with Cont rats. A 
      decrease in absolute muscle weight was observed. An increase in fiber 
      cross-sectional area/muscle wet weight was demonstrated, associated with an increase 
      in relative maximal tension. The soleus muscle changed into a slower type both in 
      contractile parameters and in MHC content, since HG soleus contained only the MHC I 
      isoform. The HG plantaris muscle presented a faster contractile behavior. Moreover, 
      the diversity of hybrid fiber types expressing multiple MHC isoforms (including MHC 
      IIB and MHC IIX isoforms) was increased in plantaris muscle after HG. Thus the HG 
      environment appears as an important inductor of muscular plasticity both in slow and 
      fast muscle types.

TI  - Effects of phenotypic plasticity on pathogen transmission in the field in a 
      Lepidoptera-NPV system.
PG  - 373-380
LID - 10.1007/s004420000397 [doi]
AB  - In models of insect-pathogen interactions, the transmission parameter (ν) is the 
      term that describes the efficiency with which pathogens are transmitted between 
      hosts. There are two components to the transmission parameter, namely the rate at 
      which the host encounters pathogens (contact rate) and the rate at which contact 
      between host and pathogen results in infection (host susceptibility). Here it is 
      shown that in larvae of Spodoptera exempta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in which 
      rearing density triggers the expression of one of two alternative phenotypes, the 
      high-density morph is associated with an increase in larval activity. This response 
      is likely to result in an increase in the contact rate between hosts and pathogens. 
      Rearing density is also known to affect susceptibility of S. exempta to pathogens, 
      with the high-density morph showing increased resistance to a baculovirus. In order 
      to determine whether density-dependent differences observed in the laboratory might 
      affect transmission in the wild, a field trial was carried out to estimate the 
      transmission parameter for S. exempta and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV). The 
      transmission parameter was found to be significantly higher among larvae reared in 
      isolation than among those reared in crowds. Models of insect-pathogen interactions, 
      in which the transmission parameter is assumed to be constant, will therefore not 
      fully describe the S. exempta-NPV system. The finding that crowding can influence 
      transmission in this way has major implications for both the long-term population 
      dynamics and the invasion dynamics of insect-pathogen systems.

AB  - Polyphenisms-alternative morphs produced through plasticity-can reveal the 
      evolutionary and ecological processes that initiate and maintain diversity within 
      populations. We examined lifetime fitness consequences of two morphs in a polyphenic 
      population of Arizona tiger salamanders using a 27-year data set with 1,317 adults 
      and 6,862 captures across eight generations. Larval salamanders develop into either 
      an aquatic paedomorph that retains larval traits and stays in its natal pond or a 
      terrestrial metamorph that undergoes metamorphosis. To evaluate the adaptive 
      significance of this polyphenism, we compared lifetime reproductive success of each 
      morph and assessed how life-history strategies and spatiotemporal variation 
      explained fitness. We found sex-specific differences in lifetime fitness between 
      morphs. For males, paedomorphs had more reproductive opportunities than metamorphs 
      when we accounted for the potential mating advantage of larger males. For females, 
      in contrast, metamorphs had higher estimated egg production than paedomorphs. 
      Life-history strategies differed between morphs largely because the morphs maximized 
      different ends of the trade-off between age at first reproduction and longevity. 
      Spatiotemporal variation affected larval more than adult life-history traits, with 
      little to no effect on lifetime fitness. Thus, environmental variation likely 
      explains differences in morph production across time and space but contributes 
      little to lifetime fitness differences between morphs and sexes. Our long-term study 
      and measures of lifetime fitness provide unique insight into the complex selective 
      regimes potentially acting on each morph and sex. Our findings motivate future work 
      to examine how sex-specific selection may contribute to the maintenance of 
      polyphenism.

AB  - Biogeochemical hotspots are pervasive at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces, 
      particularly within groundwater-surface water mixing zones (hyporheic zones), and 
      they are critical to understanding spatiotemporal variation in biogeochemical 
      cycling. Here, we use multi 'omic comparisons of hotspots to low-activity sediments 
      to gain mechanistic insight into hyporheic zone organic matter processing. We 
      hypothesized that microbiome structure and function, as described by metagenomics 
      and metaproteomics, would distinguish hotspots from low-activity sediments by 
      shifting metabolism towards carbohydrate-utilizing pathways and elucidate discrete 
      mechanisms governing organic matter processing in each location. We also expected 
      these differences to be reflected in the metabolome, whereby hotspot carbon (C) 
      pools and metabolite transformations therein would be enriched in sugar-associated 
      compounds. In contrast to expectations, we found pronounced phenotypic plasticity in 
      the hyporheic zone microbiome that was denoted by similar microbiome structure, 
      functional potential, and expression across sediments with dissimilar metabolic 
      rates. Instead, diverse nitrogenous metabolites and biochemical transformations 
      characterized hotspots. Metabolomes also corresponded more strongly to aerobic 
      metabolism than bulk C or N content only (explaining 67% vs. 42% and 37% of 
      variation respectively), and bulk C and N did not improve statistical models based 
      on metabolome composition alone. These results point to organic nitrogen as a 
      significant regulatory factor influencing hyporheic zone organic matter processing. 
      Based on our findings, we propose incorporating knowledge of metabolic pathways 
      associated with different chemical fractions of C pools into ecosystem models will 
      enhance prediction accuracy.

AB  - The use of food medicines is a widespread practice worldwide. In Brazil, such use is 
      often associated with wild animals, mostly focusing on vertebrate species. Here we 
      assessed taxonomic and ecological trends in traditional uses of wild edible 
      vertebrates in the country, through an extensive ethnobiological database analysis. 
      Our results showed that at least 165 health conditions are reportedly treated by 
      edible vertebrate species (n = 204), mostly fishes and mammals. However, reptiles 
      stand out presenting a higher plasticity in the treatment of multiple health 
      conditions. Considering the 20 disease categories recorded, treatment prescriptions 
      were similar within continental (i.e., terrestrial and freshwater) and also within 
      coastal and marine habitats, which may reflect locally related trends in occurrence 
      and use of the medicinal fauna. The comprehension of the multiplicity and trends in 
      the therapeutic uses of Brazilian vertebrates is of particular interest from a 
      conservation perspective, as several threatened species were recorded.

PG  - 2646-59
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.13411 [doi]
AB  - Deep-sea isopod scavengers such as Bathynomus sp. are able to live in nutrient-poor 
      environments, which is likely attributable to the presence of symbiotic microbes in 
      their stomach. In this study we recovered two draft genomes of mycoplasmas, Bg1 and 
      Bg2, from the metagenomes of the stomach contents and stomach sac of a Bathynomus 
      sp. sample from the South China Sea (depth of 898 m). Phylogenetic trees revealed a 
      considerable genetic distance to other mycoplasma species for Bg1 and Bg2. Compared 
      with terrestrial symbiotic mycoplasmas, the Bg1 and Bg2 genomes were enriched with 
      genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems (PTSs) and 
      sodium-driven symporters responsible for the uptake of sugars, amino acids and other 
      carbohydrates. The genome of mycoplasma Bg1 contained sialic acid lyase and 
      transporter genes, potentially enabling the bacteria to attach to the stomach sac 
      and obtain organic carbons from various cell walls. Both of the mycoplasma genomes 
      contained multiple copies of genes related to proteolysis and oligosaccharide 
      degradation, which may help the host survive in low-nutrient conditions. The 
      discovery of the different types of mycoplasma bacteria in the stomach of this 
      deep-sea isopod affords insights into symbiotic model of deep-sea animals and 
      genomic plasticity of mycoplasma bacteria.

TI  - Emerging Insights on Brazilian Pepper Tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) Invasion: The 
      Potential Role of Soil Microorganisms.

AB  - Invasive plant species constitute a major ecological and economic problem worldwide, 
      often distorting trophic levels and ecosystem balance. Numerous studies implicate 
      factors ranging from environmental plasticity, competition for nutrient and space, 
      and allelopathy in the success of invasive species in general. The Brazilian Pepper 
      tree (BP) was introduced to the United States in the 1800s and has since become a 
      category one invasive plant in Florida. It has aggressively spread to about 3000 
      km(2) of terrestrial surface, fueled in part by the prevalence of the hybrid 
      genotypes and environmental perturbations. It displays some of the well-established 
      invasive mechanisms but there is a serious dearth of knowledge on the 
      plant-microbe-soil interactions and whether the rhizobiome plays any roles in the 
      displacement of native flora and the range expansion of BP. Several control 
      measures, including chemical, mechanical, and biological antagonism have been used 
      with limited success while restoration of natives in soils from which BP was removed 
      has proved problematic partly due to a poorly understood phenomenon described as the 
      "BP legacy effect." Emerging evidence suggests that allelopathy, selective 
      recruitment of beneficial soil microbes, disruption of microbial community structure 
      and alteration of nutrient cycling, exhibited by many other invasive plant species 
      may also be involved in the case of BP. This brief review discusses the 
      well-established BP invasion mechanisms and highlights the current understanding of 
      the molecular, below-ground processes. It also points out the gaps in studies on the 
      potential role of microbial interactions in the success of BP invasion. These 
      hitherto poorly studied mechanisms could further explain the aggressive spread of BP 
      and could potentially contribute significantly to effective control measures and 
      enable appropriate strategies for restoring native plants. The review advocates for 
      the use of cutting-edge techniques in advancing the plant microbiome science. 
      Ultimately, comparing metagenomic analyses of the rhizobiome of invasive plants 
      grown in native and non-native soils could lead to a better understanding of the 
      microbial determinants of biotic resistance, potentially empowering environmental 
      managers with some predictive power of future trends of plant invasion.

TI  - The negative effect of starvation and the positive effect of mild thermal stress on 
      thermal tolerance of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1007/s00114-016-1344-5 [doi]
AB  - The thermal tolerance of a terrestrial insect species can vary as a result of 
      differences in population origin, developmental stage, age, and sex, as well as via 
      phenotypic plasticity induced in response to changes in the abiotic environment. 
      Here, we studied the effects of both starvation and mild cold and heat shocks on the 
      thermal tolerance of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Starvation led to 
      impaired cold tolerance, measured as chill coma recovery time, and this effect, 
      which was stronger in males than females, persisted for longer than 2 days but less 
      than 7 days. Heat tolerance, measured as heat knockdown time, was not affected by 
      starvation. Our results highlight the difficulty faced by insects when encountering 
      multiple stressors simultaneously and indicate physiological trade-offs. Both mild 
      cold and heat shocks led to improved heat tolerance in both sexes. It could be that 
      both mild shocks lead to the expression of heat shock proteins, enhancing heat 
      tolerance in the short run. Cold tolerance was not affected by previous mild cold 
      shock, suggesting that such a cold shock, as a single event, causes little stress 
      and hence elicits only weak physiological reaction. However, previous mild heat 
      stress led to improved cold tolerance but only in males. Our results point to both 
      hardening and cross-tolerance between cold and heat shocks.

TI  - EVIDENCE FOR POLLINATION ECOTYPES IN THE YELLOW-FRINGED ORCHID, PLATANTHERA 
      CILIARIS.
PG  - 121-133
LID - 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1990.tb04283.x [doi]
AB  - Platanthera ciliaris is a butterfly-pollinated, terrestrial orchid with a loose 
      terminal raceme of 10-50 orange flowers, characterized by a long nectariferous spur. 
      In the southeastern United States, P. ciliaris occurs in the Appalachian mountains 
      and coastal-plain physiographic provinces, but it is found rarely in the intervening 
      Piedmont. In 1983 and 1984, detailed observations of two populations within these 
      disjunct areas revealed that the butterfly species that serve as the primary 
      pollinators differ sharply. In the mountains, Papilio troilus (spicebush 
      swallowtail) was the most frequent and effective visitor, whereas in the coastal 
      plain, P. palamedes (palamedes swallowtail) was the predominant pollinator. 
      Proboscis lengths of P. troilus (mean = 23.3 mm) were significantly shorter than 
      those of P. palamedes (mean = 28.7 mm). Floral characters, most notably spur length, 
      also differed significantly between mountain (mean = 23.8 mm) and coastal-plain 
      (mean = 25.6 mm) plants. In both 1983 and 1984, levels of pollinator service, as 
      assessed by rates of removal and insertion of pollinia, were higher in the mountains 
      (0.81 and 0.86) than in the coastal plain (0.63 and 0.67). In addition, fruit-set 
      was significantly greater in mountain (83.9% in 1983, 86.5% in 1984) than in 
      coastal-plain (63.8% in 1983, 65.5% in 1984) populations. We hypothesize that 
      selection pressure exerted through pollinator proboscis lengths has resulted in 
      pollination ecotypes of P. ciliaris. The short-spurred mountain plants appear to be 
      in equilibrium with their short-tongued butterfly pollinators, receiving high levels 
      of effective pollination and achieving high levels of fruit-set. Coastal-plain 
      plants produce flowers with longer spurs which, nevertheless, are shorter than 
      optimal for insuring that very long-tongued butterflies make contact with their 
      pollinia. Thus, effective pollinator service and fruit-set are reduced. Correlation 
      analyses in 1984 showed a positive relationship between spur length and fruit-set 
      only in the coastal plain. The presence of long-tongued nectar thieves in the 
      coastal plain may also contribute to lower effective pollinator service and 
      fruit-set. Results of reciprocal-transplant studies attempting to determine the 
      genetic basis of floral characters, including spur length, were inconclusive but 
      suggest that differences between mountain and coastal-plain plants are not due 
      solely to phenotypic plasticity.

TI  - Use of anthropogenic-related nest material and nest parasite prevalence have 
      increased over the past two centuries in Australian birds.
LID - 10.1007/s00442-021-04982-z [doi]
AB  - Global plastic production has increased exponentially since the 1940s, resulting in 
      the increased presence of anthropogenic debris in the environment. Recent studies 
      have shown that birds incorporate anthropogenic debris into their nests, which can 
      reduce nest ectoparasite loads. However, we know little about the long-term history 
      of interactions among birds, anthropogenic debris, and ectoparasites. Our study took 
      a unique approach to address this issue by determining the prevalence of 
      anthropogenic debris and ectoparasitic nest flies (Protocalliphora and Passeromyia 
      spp.) in 893 bird nests from 224 species between 1832 and 2018, which were sourced 
      from Australian museum collections. The prevalence of anthropogenic material 
      increased from approximately 4% in 1832 to almost 30% in 2018. This change was 
      driven by an increase in the incorporation of synthetic rather than biodegradable 
      anthropogenic debris (by 2018 ~ 25% of all nests contained synthetics), with the 
      first synthetic item being found in a nest from 1956 in the city of Melbourne. Nest 
      parasite prevalence increased over time but contrary to other studies, there was no 
      relationship between habitat type or anthropogenic material and parasite presence. 
      Our study is the first to use museum specimens to quantify temporal and spatial 
      impacts of anthropogenic material on birds, the results of which justifies 
      contemporary concerns regarding the ubiquitous nature of human impacts on 
      terrestrial wildlife.

TI  - Female Fertility and Environmental Pollution.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17238802 [doi]
LID - 8802
AB  - A realistic picture of our world shows that it is heavily polluted everywhere. 
      Coastal regions and oceans are polluted by farm fertilizer, manure runoff, sewage 
      and industrial discharges, and large isles of waste plastic are floating around, 
      impacting sea life. Terrestrial ecosystems are contaminated by heavy metals and 
      organic chemicals that can be taken up by and accumulate in crop plants, and water 
      tables are heavily contaminated by untreated industrial discharges. As deadly 
      particulates can drift far, poor air quality has become a significant global problem 
      and one that is not exclusive to major industrialized cities. The consequences are a 
      dramatic impairment of our ecosystem and biodiversity and increases in degenerative 
      or man-made diseases. In this respect, it has been demonstrated that environmental 
      pollution impairs fertility in all mammalian species. The worst consequences are 
      observed for females since the number of germ cells present in the ovary is fixed 
      during fetal life, and the cells are not renewable. This means that any pollutant 
      affecting hormonal homeostasis and/or the reproductive apparatus inevitably harms 
      reproductive performance. This decline will have important social and economic 
      consequences that can no longer be overlooked.

TI  - Upper thermal limits of Drosophila are linked to species distributions and strongly 
      constrained phylogenetically.
PG  - 16228-33
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1207553109 [doi]
AB  - Upper thermal limits vary less than lower limits among related species of 
      terrestrial ectotherms. This pattern may reflect weak or uniform selection on upper 
      limits, or alternatively tight evolutionary constraints. We investigated this issue 
      in 94 Drosophila species from diverse climates and reared in a common environment to 
      control for plastic effects that may confound species comparisons. We found 
      substantial variation in upper thermal limits among species, negatively correlated 
      with annual precipitation at the central point of their distribution and also with 
      the interaction between precipitation and maximum temperature, showing that heat 
      resistance is an important determinant of Drosophila species distributions. Species 
      from hot and relatively dry regions had higher resistance, whereas resistance was 
      uncorrelated with temperature in wetter regions. Using a suite of analyses we showed 
      that phylogenetic signal in heat resistance reflects phylogenetic inertia rather 
      than common selection pressures. Current species distributions are therefore more 
      likely to reflect environmental sorting of lineages rather than local adaptation. 
      Similar to previous studies, thermal safety margins were small at low latitudes, 
      with safety margins smallest for species occupying both humid and dry tropical 
      environments. Thus, species from a range of environments are likely to be at risk 
      owing to climate change. Together these findings suggest that this group of insects 
      is unlikely to buffer global change effects through marked evolutionary changes, 
      highlighting the importance of facilitating range shifts for maintaining 
      biodiversity.

AB  - To cope with the increasing and less-predictable temperature forecasts under climate 
      change, many terrestrial ectotherms will have to migrate or rely on adaptation 
      through plastic or evolutionary means. Studies suggest that some ectotherms have a 
      limited potential to change their upper thermal limits via evolutionary shifts, but 
      research has mostly focused on adult life stages under laboratory conditions. Here 
      we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested 
      half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic 
      variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural 
      field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate 
      populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and 
      additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic 
      variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested 
      under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary 
      potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions 
      although the results were less clear in the field setting. Overall the results 
      suggest that ectotherms that already experience temperatures close to their upper 
      thermal tolerance limits have a restricted capacity to adapt to higher temperatures 
      by evolutionary means.

TI  - Portable remote Raman system for monitoring hydrocarbon, gas hydrates and explosives 
      in the environment.
PG  - 2404-12
AB  - We report our initial efforts to use a small portable Raman system for stand-off 
      detection and identification of various types of organic chemicals including 
      benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes (BTEX). Both fiber-optic (FO) coupled 
      and a directly coupled f/2.2 spectrograph with the telescope have been developed and 
      tested. A frequency-doubled Nd:YAG pulsed laser (20 Hz, 532 nm, 35 mJ/pulse) is used 
      as the excitation source. The operational range of the FO coupled Raman system was 
      tested to 66 m, and the directly coupled system was tested to a distance of 120 m. 
      We have also measured remote Raman spectra of compressed methane gas and methane gas 
      hydrate. The usefulness of the remote Raman system for identifying unknown compounds 
      is demonstrated by measuring stand-off spectra of two plastic explosives, e.g. 
      tri-amino tri-nitrobenzene (TATB) and beta-HMX at 10 m stand-off distance. The 
      remote Raman system will be useful for terrestrial applications such as monitoring 
      environmental pollution, in identifying unknown materials in public places in 10s or 
      less, and for detecting hydrocarbon plumes and gas hydrates on planetary surfaces 
      such as Mars.

TI  - The foraging gene as a modulator of division of labour in social insects.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2021.1940173 [doi]
AB  - The social ants, bees, wasps, and termites include some of the most 
      ecologically-successful groups of animal species. Their dominance in most 
      terrestrial environments is attributed to their social lifestyle, which enable their 
      colonies to exploit environmental resources with remarkable efficiency. One key 
      attribute of social insect colonies is the division of labour that emerges among the 
      sterile workers, which represent the majority of colony members. Studies of the 
      mechanisms that drive division of labour systems across diverse social species have 
      provided fundamental insights into the developmental, physiological, molecular, and 
      genomic processes that regulate sociality, and the possible genetic routes that may 
      have led to its evolution from a solitary ancestor. Here we specifically discuss the 
      conserved role of the foraging gene, which encodes a cGMP-dependent protein kinase 
      (PKG). Originally identified as a behaviourally polymorphic gene that drives 
      alternative foraging strategies in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, changes in 
      foraging expression and kinase activity were later shown to play a key role in the 
      division of labour in diverse social insect species as well. In particular, foraging 
      appears to regulate worker transitions between behavioural tasks and specific 
      behavioural traits associated with morphological castes. Although the specific 
      neuroethological role of foraging in the insect brain remains mostly unknown, 
      studies in genetically tractable insect species indicate that PKG signalling plays a 
      conserved role in the neuronal plasticity of sensory, cognitive and motor functions, 
      which underlie behaviours relevant to division of labour, including appetitive 
      learning, aggression, stress response, phototaxis, and the response to pheromones.

AB  - Scorpions exhibit some of the lowest recorded water loss rates among terrestrial 
      arthropods. Evaporative water loss to the surrounding environment occurs mainly 
      through the integument, and thus its resistance to water loss has paramount 
      significance for the ability of scorpions to tolerate extremely dry habitats. 
      Cuticular hydrocarbons (HCs) deposited on the outer epicuticle play an important 
      role in determining cuticular waterproofing, and seasonal variation in both 
      cuticular HC quantity and composition has been shown to correlate with water loss 
      rates. Precursor incorporation rates into cuticle HCs have been observed to be 
      extremely low in scorpions compared with insects. We therefore used adult male 
      Buthus occitanus (Buthidae) in order to test HC profile plasticity during acute 
      exposure to 14 d and 28 d of experimental desiccation. Cuticular HC profile of 
      hydrated scorpions was similar to that reported for several other scorpion species, 
      consisting of similar fractions of n-alkanes and branched alkanes, with no evidence 
      for unsaturation. Most abundant of the n-alkanes were n-heptacosane (C27; 19±2% of 
      total HCs), n-nonacosane (C29; 16±1%) and n-hentriacontane (C31; 11±1%). Exposure to 
      desiccation stress resulted in a significant increase in the total amount of 
      extracted HCs, and in the relative abundance of branched alkanes at the expense of 
      n-alkanes. Together with an increase in HC chain lengths, these changes mimic 
      previously-reported seasonal variation among freshly-collected specimens. This 
      indicates that scorpions respond to water shortage by regulating the properties of 
      their passive integumental barrier to water loss.

AB  - The discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the phylum Thaumarchaeota and 
      the high abundance of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase subunit A encoding gene 
      sequences in many environments have extended our perception of nitrifying microbial 
      communities. Moreover, AOA are the only aerobic ammonia oxidizers known to be active 
      in geothermal environments. Molecular data indicate that in many globally 
      distributed terrestrial high-temperature habits a thaumarchaeotal lineage within the 
      Nitrosopumilus cluster (also called "marine" group I.1a) thrives, but these microbes 
      have neither been isolated from these systems nor functionally characterized in situ 
      yet. In this study, we report on the enrichment and genomic characterization of a 
      representative of this lineage from a thermal spring in Kamchatka. This 
      thaumarchaeote, provisionally classified as "Candidatus Nitrosotenuis uzonensis", is 
      a moderately thermophilic, non-halophilic, chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizer. 
      The nearly complete genome sequence (assembled into a single scaffold) of this AOA 
      confirmed the presence of the typical thaumarchaeotal pathways for ammonia oxidation 
      and carbon fixation, and indicated its ability to produce coenzyme F420 and to 
      chemotactically react to its environment. Interestingly, like members of the genus 
      Nitrosoarchaeum, "Candidatus N. uzonensis" also possesses a putative 
      artubulin-encoding gene. Genome comparisons to related AOA with available genome 
      sequences confirmed that the newly cultured AOA has an average nucleotide identity 
      far below the species threshold and revealed a substantial degree of genomic 
      plasticity with unique genomic regions in "Ca. N. uzonensis", which potentially 
      include genetic determinants of ecological niche differentiation.

      calling temperatures in ectotherms.
PG  - 2655-74
LID - 10.1111/gcb.12267 [doi]
AB  - Calling behaviour is strongly temperature-dependent and critical for sexual 
      selection and reproduction in a variety of ectothermic taxa, including anuran 
      amphibians, which are the most globally threatened vertebrates. However, few studies 
      have explored how species respond to distinct thermal environments at time of 
      displaying calling behaviour, and thus it is still unknown whether ongoing climate 
      change might compromise the performance of calling activity in ectotherms. Here, we 
      used new audio-trapping techniques (automated sound recording and detection systems) 
      between 2006 and 2009 to examine annual calling temperatures of five temperate 
      anurans and their patterns of geographical and seasonal variation at the thermal 
      extremes of species ranges, providing insights into the thermal breadths of calling 
      activity of species, and the mechanisms that enable ectotherms to adjust to changing 
      thermal environments. All species showed wide thermal breadths during calling 
      behaviour (above 15 °C) and increases in calling temperatures in extremely warm 
      populations and seasons. Thereby, calling temperatures differed both geographically 
      and seasonally, both in terrestrial and aquatic species, and were 8-22 °C below the 
      specific upper critical thermal limits (CTmax ) and strongly associated with the 
      potential temperatures of each thermal environment (operative temperatures during 
      the potential period of breeding). This suggests that calling behaviour in 
      ectotherms may take place at population-specific thermal ranges, diverging when 
      species are subjected to distinct thermal environments, and might imply plasticity 
      of thermal adjustment mechanisms (seasonal and developmental acclimation) that 
      supply species with means of coping with climate change. Furthermore, the thermal 
      thresholds of calling at the onset of the breeding season were dissimilar between 
      conspecific populations, suggesting that other factors besides temperature are 
      needed to trigger the onset of reproduction. Our findings imply that global warming 
      would not directly inhibit calling behaviour in the study species, although might 
      affect other temperature-dependent features of their acoustic communication system.

TI  - Can oxygen set thermal limits in an insect and drive gigantism?
PG  - e22610
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0022610 [doi]
LID - e22610
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thermal limits may arise through a mismatch between oxygen supply and 
      demand in a range of animal taxa. Whilst this oxygen limitation hypothesis is 
      supported by data from a range of marine fish and invertebrates, its generality 
      remains contentious. In particular, it is unclear whether oxygen limitation 
      determines thermal extremes in tracheated arthropods, where oxygen limitation may be 
      unlikely due to the efficiency and plasticity of tracheal systems in supplying 
      oxygen directly to metabolically active tissues. Although terrestrial taxa with open 
      tracheal systems may not be prone to oxygen limitation, species may be affected 
      during other life-history stages, particularly if these rely on diffusion into 
      closed tracheal systems. Furthermore, a central role for oxygen limitation in 
      insects is envisaged within a parallel line of research focussing on insect 
      gigantism in the late Palaeozoic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we examine 
      thermal maxima in the aquatic life stages of an insect at normoxia, hypoxia (14 kPa) 
      and hyperoxia (36 kPa). We demonstrate that upper thermal limits do indeed respond 
      to external oxygen supply in the aquatic life stages of the stonefly Dinocras 
      cephalotes, suggesting that the critical thermal limits of such aquatic larvae are 
      set by oxygen limitation. This could result from impeded oxygen delivery, or limited 
      oxygen regulatory capacity, both of which have implications for our understanding of 
      the limits to insect body size and how these are influenced by atmospheric oxygen 
      levels. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings extend the generality of the 
      hypothesis of oxygen limitation of thermal tolerance, suggest that oxygen 
      constraints on body size may be stronger in aquatic environments, and that oxygen 
      toxicity may have actively selected for gigantism in the aquatic stages of 
      Carboniferous arthropods.

AB  - Marine to freshwater colonizations constitute among the most dramatic evolutionary 
      transitions in the history of life. This study examined evolution of ionic 
      regulation following saline-to-freshwater transitions in an invasive species. In 
      recent years, the copepod Eurytemora affinis has invaded freshwater habitats 
      multiple times independently. We found parallel evolutionary shifts in ion-motive 
      enzyme activity (V-type H(+) ATPase, Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase) across independent 
      invasions and in replicate laboratory selection experiments. Freshwater populations 
      exhibited increased V-type H(+) ATPase activity in fresh water (0 PSU) and declines 
      at higher salinity (15 PSU) relative to saline populations. This shift represented 
      marked evolutionary increases in plasticity. In contrast, freshwater populations 
      displayed reduced Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase activity across all salinities. Most notably, 
      modifying salinity alone during laboratory selection experiments recapitulated the 
      evolutionary shifts in V-type H(+) ATPase activity observed in nature. Maternal and 
      embryonic acclimation could not account for the observed shifts in enzyme activity. 
      V-type H(+) ATPase function has been hypothesized to be critical for freshwater and 
      terrestrial adaptations, but evolution of this enzyme function had not been 
      previously demonstrated in the context of habitat transitions. Moreover, the speed 
      of these evolutionary shifts was remarkable, within a few generations in the 
      laboratory and a few decades in the wild.

TI  - Body condition at weaning affects the duration of the postweaning fast in gray seal 
      pups (Halichoerus grypus).
PG  - 269-77

AB  - Gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) undergo a terrestrial postweaning fast (PWF) that 
      depletes energy reserves acquired during the suckling interval. Plasticity in PWF 
      duration may ensure that pups of variable body condition depart for sea with 
      adequate energy reserves. To test this hypothesis, we examined body condition of 30 
      gray seal pups at weaning and monitored their PWF duration. On average, fat 
      accounted for 47.3% +/- 0.7% of their 53.2 +/- 1.3-kg weaning mass. Although fasting 
      duration averaged 21 +/- 1.1 d (n = p28), there was considerable variation in 
      fasting duration (9 to > 31 d) and the resulting age when pups departed to sea (26 
      to > 49 d). Percent fat at weaning(38.6%-54.6%) was positively correlated with 
      fasting duration(n = 28, r = 0.376, P = 0.0489). In contrast, total body gross 
      energy (735.3-1,447.4 MJ) and body mass (39.0-66.0 kg) were not correlated with 
      fasting duration. Thus, body composition,not overall body reserves, predicted 
      fasting duration, but the effect was weak, indicating that other factors also 
      account for the observed variation in fasting duration. We speculate that pups with 
      greater percent fat more effectively utilized lipid and conserved protein while 
      meeting metabolic costs throughout the PWF. As a result, fatter pups extended the 
      PWF duration,which may be critical for development of diving physiology and may have 
      facilitated their survivorship to age 1.

TI  - Protecting embryos from stress: corticosterone effects and the corticosterone 
      response to capture and confinement during pregnancy in a live-bearing lizard 
      (Hoplodactylus maculatus).
PG  - 316-29
AB  - Hormones in the embryonic environment, including those of the 
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, have profound effects on development in 
      eutherian mammals. However, little is known about their effects in reptiles that 
      have independently evolved viviparity. We investigated whether exogenous 
      corticosterone affected embryonic development in the viviparous gecko Hoplodactylus 
      maculatus, and whether pregnant geckos have a corticosterone response to capture and 
      confinement that is suppressed relative to that in non-pregnant (vitellogenic) 
      females and males. Corticosterone implants (5 mg, slow-release) administered to 
      females in mid-pregnancy caused a large elevation of corticosterone in maternal 
      plasma (P<0.001), probable reductions in embryonic growth and development 
      (P=0.069-0.073), developmental abnormalities and eventual abortions. Cool 
      temperature produced similar reductions in embryonic growth and development (P< or 
      =0.036 cf. warm controls), but pregnancies were eventually successful. Despite the 
      potentially harmful effects of elevated plasma corticosterone, pregnant females did 
      not suppress their corticosterone response to capture and confinement relative to 
      vitellogenic females, and both groups of females had higher responses than males. 
      Future research should address whether lower maternal doses of corticosterone 
      produce non-lethal effects on development that could contribute to phenotypic 
      plasticity. Corticosterone implants also led to increased basking in pregnant 
      females (P<0.001), and basal corticosterone in wild geckos (independent of 
      reproductive condition) was positively correlated with body temperature (P<0.001). 
      Interactions between temperature and corticosterone may have broad significance to 
      other terrestrial ectotherms, and body temperature should be considered as a 
      variable influencing plasma corticosterone concentrations in all future studies on 
      reptiles.

LID - 614968
AB  - In theory, changes in the amount of rainfall can change plant biomass allocation and 
      subsequently influence coupled plant-soil microbial processes. However, testing 
      patterns of combined responses of plants and soils remains a knowledge gap for 
      terrestrial ecosystems. We carried out a comprehensive review of the available 
      literature and conducted a meta-analysis to explore combined plant and soil 
      microbial responses in grasslands exposed to experimental precipitation changes. We 
      measured the effects of experimental precipitation changes on plant biomass, biomass 
      allocation, and soil microbial biomass and tested for trade-offs between plant and 
      soil responses to altered precipitation. We found that aboveground and belowground 
      plant biomass responded asynchronically to precipitation changes, thereby leading to 
      shifts in plant biomass allocation. Belowground plant biomass did not change under 
      precipitation changes, but aboveground plant biomass decreased in precipitation 
      reduction and increased in precipitation addition. There was a trade-off between 
      responses of aboveground plant biomass and belowground plant biomass to 
      precipitation reduction, but correlation wasn't found for precipitation addition. 
      Microbial biomass carbon (C) did not change under the treatments of precipitation 
      reduction. Increased root allocation may buffer drought stress for soil microbes 
      through root exudations and neutralize microbial responses to precipitation 
      reduction. However, precipitation addition increased microbial biomass C, 
      potentially reflecting the removal of water limitation for soil microbial growth. We 
      found that there were positive correlations between responses of aboveground plant 
      biomass and microbial biomass C to precipitation addition, indicating that increased 
      shoot growth probably promoted microbial responses via litter inputs. In sum, our 
      study suggested that aboveground, belowground plant biomass and soil microbial 
      biomass can respond asynchronically to precipitation changes, and emphasizes that 
      testing the plant-soil system as a whole is necessary for forecasting the effects of 
      precipitation changes on grassland systems.

      epigenetic mechanisms to contribute to adaptive phenotypes, it remains unknown 
      whether heritable variation in ecologically relevant traits is at least partially 
      epigenetically determined in natural populations. Here, we tested the hypothesis 
      that DNA methylation variation contributes to heritable differences in flowering 
      time within a single widespread apomictic clonal lineage of the common dandelion 
      (Taraxacum officinale s. lat.). Apomictic clone members of the same apomictic 
      lineage collected from different field sites showed heritable differences in 
      flowering time, which was correlated with inherited differences in 
      methylation-sensitive AFLP marker profiles. Differences in flowering between 
      apomictic clone members were significantly reduced after in vivo demethylation using 
      the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor zebularine. This synchronization of flowering 
      times suggests that flowering time divergence within an apomictic lineage was 
      mediated by differences in DNA methylation. While the underlying basis of the 
      methylation polymorphism at functional flowering time-affecting loci remains to be 
      demonstrated, our study shows that epigenetic variation contributes to heritable 
      phenotypic divergence in ecologically relevant traits in natural plant populations. 
      This result also suggests that epigenetic mechanisms can facilitate adaptive 
      divergence within genetically uniform asexual lineages.

AB  - For the first time in vertebrate palaeontology, the potential of joining Finite 
      Element Analysis (FEA) and Parametrical Analysis (PA) is used to shed new light on 
      two different cranial parameters from the orbits to evaluate their biomechanical 
      role and evolutionary patterns. The early tetrapod group of Stereospondyls, one of 
      the largest groups of Temnospondyls is used as a case study because its orbits 
      position and size vary hugely within the members of this group. An adult skull of 
      Edingerella madagascariensis was analysed using two different cases of boundary and 
      loading conditions in order to quantify stress and deformation response under a 
      bilateral bite and during skull raising. Firstly, the variation of the original 
      geometry of its orbits was introduced in the models producing new FEA results, 
      allowing the exploration of the ecomorphology, feeding strategy and evolutionary 
      patterns of these top predators. Secondly, the quantitative results were analysed in 
      order to check if the orbit size and position were correlated with different stress 
      patterns. These results revealed that in most of the cases the stress distribution 
      is not affected by changes in the size and position of the orbit. This finding 
      supports the high mechanical plasticity of this group during the Triassic period. 
      The absence of mechanical constraints regarding the orbit probably promoted the 
      ecomorphological diversity acknowledged for this group, as well as its ecological 
      niche differentiation in the terrestrial Triassic ecosystems in clades as 
      lydekkerinids, trematosaurs, capitosaurs or metoposaurs.

TI  - The implications of temperature-mediated plasticity in larval instar number for 
      development within a marine invertebrate, the shrimp Palaemonetes varians.
PG  - e75785
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0075785 [doi]
LID - e75785
AB  - Variations in larval instar number are common among arthropods. Here, we assess the 
      implications of temperature-mediated variations in larval instar number for larval 
      development time, larval growth rates, and juvenile dry weight within the palaemonid 
      shrimp, Palaemonetes varians. In contrast with previous literature, which focuses on 
      terrestrial arthropods, particularly model and pest species often of laboratory 
      lines, we use wild shrimp, which differ in their life history from previous models. 
      Newly-hatched P. varians larvae were first reared at 5, 10, 17, 25, and 30 °C to 
      assess their thermal scope for development. Larvae developed at 17, 25, and 30 °C. 
      At higher temperatures, larvae developed through fewer larval instars. Two dominant 
      developmental pathways were observed; a short pathway of four instars and a long 
      pathway of five instars. Longer developmental pathways of six to seven instars were 
      rarely observed (mostly at lower temperatures) and consisted of additional instars 
      as 'repeat' instars; i.e. little developmental advance over the preceding instar. To 
      assess the implications of temperature-mediated variation in larval instar number, 
      newly-hatched larvae were then reared at 15, 20, and 25 °C. Again, the proportion of 
      larvae developing through four instars increased with temperature. At all 
      temperatures, larval development time and juvenile dry weight were greater for 
      larvae developing through five instars. Importantly, because of the increasing 
      proportion of larvae developing through four instars with increasing temperature, 
      larval traits associated with this pathway (reduced development time and juvenile 
      dry weight) became more dominant. As a consequence of increasing growth rate with 
      temperature, and the shift in the proportion of larvae developing through four 
      instars, juvenile dry weight was greatest at intermediate temperatures (20 °C). We 
      conclude that at settlement P. varians juveniles do not follow the temperature-size 
      rule; this is of importance for life-history ecology in response to environmental 
      change, as well as for aquaculture applications.

AB  - Microplastics are small plastic pieces with sizes less than 5 mm. Due to their 
      widespread distribution in different environmental compartments, food, and drinking 
      water, microplastics have attracted increasing attention across the world. Previous 
      reports have focused on the source, distribution, fate, and toxicity of 
      microplastics. However, many of these studies and reviews are not quite 
      comprehensive, and most of them have only focused on marine environments. Therefore, 
      we comprehensively reviewed the available literature on the source, occurrence, and 
      fate of microplastics in different environments, including air, freshwater, soil, 
      and ocean, across the world. Our review suggests that the sources of microplastics 
      are extensive and diverse and that their occurrence, transport, and fate in the 
      environment are affected by a variety of natural factors as well as their own 
      physicochemical properties. Studies on the toxicological effects of microplastics 
      are also reviewed. We found that large research gaps exist in the quantitative 
      analysis of different exposure routes of microplastics, and microplastic toxicity to 
      organisms. Moreover, key suggestions for future research are presented, and we call 
      for more efforts focusing on the occurrence and fate of microplastics in terrestrial 
      environments, especially in the atmosphere and soil, and further investigations on 
      the toxicity mechanisms of microplastics.

TI  - Performance trade-offs in wild mice.
PG  - 11-23
LID - 10.1007/s00442-019-04450-9 [doi]
AB  - Various aspects of performance (e.g., speed, strength, endurance) are thought to be 
      important determinants of the success of animals in natural activities such as 
      foraging, mating, and escaping from predators. However, it is generally known that 
      morphological properties enhancing one type of performance (e.g., strength) can lead 
      to a reduction in another (e.g., speed). Such performance trade-offs have been 
      quantified at the inter-specific level, but evidence at the individual level remains 
      equivocal. To test for the presence of a performance trade-off, we repeatedly 
      captured a total of 189 wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and measured 
      their grip strength and sprint speed. Using the maximum performance score obtained 
      for each individual across all their repeated tests, we obtained a counter-intuitive 
      (and biased) positive and highly significant phenotypic correlation. Using a 
      bivariate mixed model, we detected a significant negative among-individual 
      correlation between grip strength and sprint speed. By contrast, the 
      within-individual correlation was positive but non-significant, thus illustrating 
      the importance of properly partitioning the correlations at the among- and 
      within-individual levels when testing for the presence of a performance trade-off. 
      This study is one of the first to detect a performance trade-off at the 
      among-individual level in a wild animal population. Such a trade-off may be caused 
      by individual differences in muscle physiology and scapular morphology resulting 
      from genetic differences and/or plastic responses to differential use of the 
      arboreal vs. terrestrial parts of the environment.

PG  - 685-90
LID - 10.1007/s10661-009-1143-y [doi]
AB  - This study assesses the level of background radiation for Canakkale province of 
      northwestern Turkey. Radon concentrations in indoor air were determined using CR-39 
      nuclear track detectors and (222)Rn activity was found to be 167 Bq m( - 3) 
      (equivalent to an annual effective dose of 4.2 mSv). Measurements of outdoor gamma 
      radiation (of terrestrial and cosmic origin) in air were performed using plastic 
      scintillators, and the average absorbed gamma dose rate was found to be 66.4 nGy h( 
      - 1) (corresponding to an annual effective dose of 81.4 muSv). The radionuclide 
      activity concentrations in soil samples collected from the study area were measured 
      through gamma-ray spectrometry, and the average activities were determined as 94.55, 
      110.4, and 1,273 Bq kg( - 1) for the natural radionuclides (238)U, (232)Th, and 
      (40)K, respectively, and 19.39 Bq kg( - 1) for the fission product (137)Cs. The 
      natural radioactivity sources resulted in an annual effective dose of 184 muSv. The 
      radioactivity levels of drinking water samples were measured as 0.0599 Bq l( - 1) 
      for gross-alpha activity and 0.0841 Bq l( - 1) for gross-beta activity using a 
      low-background counting technique (equivalent to an annual effective dose of 12.25 
      muSv). The results of this study show that the activity levels of radon in air, 
      radionuclides in soil, and alpha activities in drinking water are higher compared to 
      the data available for other Turkish cities and the world averages. On the other 
      hand, the outdoor gamma dose rates in air and beta activities in drinking water are 
      within natural limits.

TI  - Comparison of mechanical properties of four large, wave-exposed seaweeds.
PG  - 1426-32
LID - 10.3732/ajb.93.10.1426 [doi]
AB  - Seaweeds have a simple structural design compared to most terrestrial plants. 
      Nonetheless, some species have adapted to the severe mechanical conditions of the 
      surf zone. The material properties of either tissue sections or the whole stipe of 
      four wave-exposed seaweeds, Durvillaea antarctica, D. willana, Laminaria digitata, 
      and L. hyperborea, were tested in tension, bending, and torsion. Durvillaea has a 
      very low modulus of elasticity in tension (E(tension) = 3-7 MN·m(-2)) and in bending 
      (E(bending) = 9-12 MN · m(-2)), torsion modulus (G = 0.3 MN · m(-2)) and strength 
      (σ(b)rk = 1-2 MN · m(-2)), combining a compliable and twistable stipe "material" 
      with a comparatively high breaking strain (ε(brk) = 0.4-0.6). In comparison, the 
      smaller stipes of Laminaria have a higher modulus of elasticity in tension 
      (E(tension) = 6-28 MN·m(-2)) and in bending (E(bending) = 84-109 MN·m(-2)), similar 
      strength (σ(brk) = 1-3 MN·m(-2)), and a higher torsion modulus (G = 0.7-10 
      MN·m(-2)), combined with a lower breaking strain (ε(brk) = 0.2-0.3) than Durvillaea. 
      Time-dependent, viscoelastic reactions were investigated with cycling tests. The 
      tested species dissipated 42-52% of the loading energy in tension through 
      plastic-viscoelastic processes, a finding that bears important ecological 
      implications. Overall, there seems to be no correlation between single material 
      properties and the size or habitat position of the tested seaweed species.

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary opportunities of apomixis: insights from Taraxacum and 
      Chondrilla.
PG  - 1113-21
AB  - The ecological and evolutionary opportunities of apomixis in the short and the long 
      term are considered, based on two closely related apomictic genera: Taraxacum 
      (dandelion) and Chondrilla (skeleton weed). In both genera apomicts have a wider 
      geographical distribution than sexuals, illustrating the short-term ecological 
      success of apomixis. Allozymes and DNA markers indicate that apomictic populations 
      are highly polyclonal. In Taraxacum, clonal diversity can be generated by rare 
      hybridization between sexuals and apomicts, the latter acting as pollen donors. Less 
      extensive clonal diversity is generated by mutations within clonal lineages. Clonal 
      diversity may be maintained by frequency-dependent selection, caused by biological 
      interactions (e.g. competitors and pathogens). Some clones are geographically 
      widespread and probably represent phenotypically plastic 'general-purpose 
      genotypes'. The long-term evolutionary success of apomictic clones may be limited by 
      lack of adaptive potential and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Although 
      apomictic clones may be considered as 'evolutionary dead ends', the genes 
      controlling apomixis can escape from degeneration and extinction via pollen in 
      crosses between sexuals and apomicts. In this way, apomixis genes are transferred to 
      a new genetic background, potentially adaptive and cleansed from linked deleterious 
      mutations. Consequently, apomixis genes can be much older than the clones they are 
      currently contained in. The close phylogenetic relationship between Taraxacum and 
      Chondrilla and the similarity of their apomixis mechanisms suggest that apomixis in 
      these two genera could be of common ancestry.

TI  - Antimicrobial Drug Resistance in Fish Pathogens.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.ARBA-0017-2017 [doi]
AB  - Major concerns surround the use of antimicrobial agents in farm-raised fish, 
      including the potential impacts these uses may have on the development of 
      antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in fish and the aquatic environment. Currently, 
      some antimicrobial agents commonly used in aquaculture are only partially effective 
      against select fish pathogens due to the emergence of resistant bacteria. Although 
      reports of ineffectiveness in aquaculture due to resistant pathogens are scarce in 
      the literature, some have reported mass mortalities in Penaeus monodon larvae caused 
      by Vibrio harveyi resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, 
      erythromycin, and streptomycin. Genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance 
      have been described in aquaculture environments and are commonly found on mobile 
      genetic elements which are recognized as the primary source of antimicrobial 
      resistance for important fish pathogens. Indeed, resistance genes have been found on 
      transferable plasmids and integrons in pathogenic bacterial species in the genera 
      Aeromonas, Yersinia, Photobacterium, Edwardsiella, and Vibrio. Class 1 integrons and 
      IncA/C plasmids have been widely identified in important fish pathogens (Aeromonas 
      spp., Yersinia spp., Photobacterium spp., Edwardsiella spp., and Vibrio spp.) and 
      are thought to play a major role in the transmission of antimicrobial resistance 
      determinants in the aquatic environment. The identification of plasmids in 
      terrestrial pathogens (Salmonella enterica serotypes, Escherichia coli, and others) 
      which have considerable homology to plasmid backbone DNA from aquatic pathogens 
      suggests that the plasmid profiles of fish pathogens are extremely plastic and 
      mobile and constitute a considerable reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes 
      for pathogens in diverse environments.

TI  - Mismatch between cuticle deposition and area expansion in fruit skins allows 
      potentially catastrophic buildup of elastic strain.
PG  - 1145-1156
AB  - The continuous deposition of cutin and wax during leaf and fruit growth is crucial 
      to alleviate elastic strain of the cuticle, minimize the risk of failure and 
      maintain its barrier functions. The cuticular membrane (CM) is a lipoidal biopolymer 
      that covers primary surfaces of terrestrial plants. CMs have barrier functions in 
      water and solute transfer and pathogen invasion. These require intact CMs throughout 
      growth. This is a challenge particularly for fruit, because they increase in area 
      from initiation through to maturity. Our paper investigates the effects of cutin and 
      wax deposition on strain buildup in the CM. We use developing fruits and leaves of 
      apple (Malus × domestica) and sweet cherry (Prunus avium) as models. The hypothesis 
      was that the continuous deposition of the CM prevents the buildup of excessive 
      elastic strain in fruit and leaves. Strains were quantified from decreases in 
      surface area of CMs after isolation from epidermal discs, after wax extraction and 
      from increases in surface area during development. Cuticle mass per unit area 
      increased throughout development in apple fruit, and leaves of apple and sweet 
      cherry. In sweet cherry fruit, however, CM mass increased only initially, but 
      thereafter decreased as the surface expanded rapidly. The release of strain on CM 
      isolation was low in apple fruit and leaves and sweet cherry leaves, but high in 
      sweet cherry fruit. Conversely, strains fixed by the deposition of wax and cutin 
      were high in apple fruit and leaves and sweet cherry leaves, but low in sweet cherry 
      fruit. Our results indicate that in expanding organs, deposition of cutin and wax in 
      the CM allows conversion of elastic to plastic strain. Hence, any lack of such 
      deposition allows buildup of high, potentially catastrophic, elastic strain.

AB  - Background color convergence of prey occurring through local adaptation or 
      phenotypically plastic responses can reduce predation rates by visual predators. We 
      assessed the capacity for substrate color-induced melanization in eight turtle 
      species within the groups Chelydridae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, and Trionychidae by 
      rearing individuals on black or white substrates for 160 days. In all aquatic turtle 
      species, integuments of the head and carapace of the individuals that were reared on 
      a black substrate were darker than of those reared on a white substrate. In the 
      terrestrial turtle Terrapene carolina carolina, however, no significant differences 
      in dorsal head skin or carapace color were observed between treatments. Histological 
      examination of tail tips in three aquatic species (Chelydra serpentina serpentina, 
      Graptemys geographica, and Trachemys scripta elegans) indicated that substrate 
      color-induced melanization is morphological, involving the transfer of melanosomes 
      from basal epidermal melanocytes to adjacent keratinocytes. Interestingly, substrate 
      color-induced melanization in a previously studied Pleurodire species apparently 
      involves physiological color change. We could not, however, rule out physiological 
      components to color change in the turtles of our study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyse via life cycle analysis (LCA) the global resource use and 
      environmental output of the endodontic procedure. METHODOLOGY: An LCA was conducted 
      to measure the life cycle of a standard/routine two-visit RCT. The LCA was conducted 
      according to the International Organization of Standardization guidelines; ISO 
      14040:2006. All clinical elements of an endodontic treatment (RCT) were input into 
      OpenLCA software using process and flows from the ecoinvent database. Travel to and 
      from the dental clinic was not included. Environmental outputs included abiotic 
      depletion, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity/eutrophication, human toxicity, 
      cancer/non cancer effects, ionizing radiation, global warming, marine 
      eutrophication, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation and terrestrial 
      eutrophication. RESULTS: An RCT procedure contributes 4.9 kg of carbon dioxide 
      equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions. This is the equivalent of a 30 km drive in a small 
      car. The main 5 contributors were dental clothing followed by surface disinfection 
      (isopropanol), disposable bib (paper and plastic), single-use stainless steel 
      instruments and electricity use. Although this LCA has illustrated the effect 
      endodontic treatment has on the environment, there are a number of limitations that 
      may influence the validity of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The endodontic team need to 
      consider how they can reduce the environmental burden of endodontic care. One 
      immediate area of focus might be to consider alternatives to isopropyl alcohol, and 
      look at paper, single use instrument and electricity use. Longer term, research into 
      environmentally-friendly medicaments should continue to investigate the replacement 
      of current cytotoxic gold standards with possible natural alternatives. Minimally 
      invasive regenerative endodontics techniques designed to stimulate repair or 
      regeneration of damaged pulp tissue may also be one way of improving the 
      environmental impact of an RCT.

TI  - Attribute-based classification of European hydrophytes and its relationship to 
      habitat utilization.
PG  - 43-74
LID - 10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00523.x [doi]
AB  - 1Here we classify selected European hydrophytes into 'attribute groups' based on the 
      possession of homogenous sets of characteristics, and explore the correspondence 
      between these attribute groups, or individual attributes, and habitat 
      use.2Non-hierarchical clustering was used to assign 120 species to twenty groups 
      based on a matrix of categorical scores for literature- and field-derived 
      information covering seventeen intrinsic morphological and life-history traits. 
      Subdivision of some of these traits produced a total of 58 attributes (i.e. 
      modalities). The robustness of this classification was confirmed by a high rate of 
      reclassification (92%) under multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). The phylogenetic 
      contribution was explored using ordination methods with taxonomy at family level 
      acting as a covariable.3Our approach differed from earlier classifications based on 
      growth or life form because we regarded growth form plasticity as a property of the 
      species and its range of growing conditions, rather than of each individual 
      population, and we considered additional (e.g. regenerative) traits. However, some 
      conventional life form groups were preserved (i.e. utricularids, isoetids, 
      hydrocharids and lemnids).4Some parallels existed with established theory on 
      terrestrial plant growth strategies, but we used strictly intrinsic attributes 
      relevant specifically to hydrophytes and our groups could not be decomposed into 
      three or four primary strategies. Only finer levels of partitioning appear to be of 
      fundamental and applied ecological relevance in hydrophytes.5A principal components 
      analysis ordination based on 26 attributes related to physical habitat utilization 
      separated species and their attribute groups along axes relating to: (a) flow, 
      substratum grade and organic matter content, scour frequency, and sedimentation; and 
      (b) depth, water level stability and biotic disturbance. A MDA applied to species 
      ordination scores indicated only a modest overall correspondence between attribute 
      groups and habitat use (54% correct reclassification). Poor reclassification was the 
      result of intergroup overlap (indicating alternative sets of attributes for a given 
      habitat) or high intragroup variance in habitat utilization (indicating commonality 
      of attributes between different habitats). These results are interpreted in terms of 
      trade-offs between resistance and resilience traits, 'functional plasticity' in 
      traits, phylogenetic dependence in some groups and methodological constraints. The 
      predictive potential of hydrophyte groups and their limitations are 
      discussed.6Redundancy analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between 
      traits and habitat use (P < 0.01). Our attribute matrix explained 72% of variation 
      in physical habitat use with eight attributes (i.e. turions, anchored emergent 
      leaves, high or low body flexibility, high root:shoot biomass ratio, free-floating 
      surface or free-floating submerged growth form, and annual life history) explaining 
      half of this variation.7Most attributes were mapped in accordance with habitat 
      template predictions, although tests were confounded by the underlying correlation 
      between spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The main features were: (a) a trade-off 
      between resistance-type traits (related to stream lining, flexibility and anchorage) 
      in more spatially heterogenous riverine and littoral zone habitats, and resilience 
      type traits (i.e. turions, very small body size and free-floating growth forms) in 
      spatially simple, rarely disturbed habitats, such as backwaters and canals; and (b) 
      a shift from high investment competitive traits with a low reproductive output in 
      deep stable habitats to classically ruderal and desiccation resistance traits in 
      shallow fluctuating habitats.

TI  - Photosynthesis and growth reduction with warming are driven by nonstomatal 
      limitations in a Mediterranean semi-arid shrub.
PG  - 2725-38
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2074 [doi]
AB  - Whereas warming enhances plant nutrient status and photosynthesis in most 
      terrestrial ecosystems, dryland vegetation is vulnerable to the likely increases in 
      evapotranspiration and reductions in soil moisture caused by elevated temperatures. 
      Any warming-induced declines in plant primary production and cover in drylands would 
      increase erosion, land degradation, and desertification. We conducted a four-year 
      manipulative experiment in a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem to evaluate the 
      impacts of a ~2°C warming on the photosynthesis, transpiration, leaf nutrient 
      status, chlorophyll content, isotopic composition, biomass growth, and postsummer 
      survival of the native shrub Helianthemum squamatum. We predicted that warmed plants 
      would show reduced photosynthetic activity and growth, primarily due to the greater 
      stomatal limitation imposed by faster and more severe soil drying under warming. On 
      average, warming reduced net photosynthetic rates by 36% across the study period. 
      Despite this strong response, warming did not affect stomatal conductance and 
      transpiration. The reduction of peak photosynthetic rates with warming was more 
      pronounced in a drought year than in years with near-average rainfall (75% and 
      25-40% reductions relative to controls, respectively), with no indications of 
      photosynthetic acclimation to warming through time. Warmed plants had lower leaf N 
      and P contents, δ (13)C, and sparser and smaller leaves than control plants. Warming 
      reduced shoot dry mass production by 31%. However, warmed plants were able to cope 
      with large reductions in net photosynthesis, leaf area, and shoot biomass production 
      without changes in postsummer survival rates. Our findings highlight the key role of 
      nonstomatal factors (biochemical and/or nutritional) in reducing net carbon 
      assimilation rates and growth under warming, which has important implications for 
      projections of plant carbon balance under the warmer and drier climatic scenario 
      predicted for drylands worldwide. Projected climate warming over the coming decades 
      could reduce net primary production by about one-third in semi-arid gypsum 
      shrublands dominated by H. squamatum.

TI  - Expression of MAP/ERK kinase cascade corresponds to the ability to develop food 
      aversion in terrestrial snail at different stages of ontogenesis.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      (MAPK/ERK) cascade plays an important role in gene expression regulation during 
      memory formation in both vertebrates and invertebrates. MAPK/ERK regulates gene 
      expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors binding to the 
      regulatory elements SRE and CRE of target genes. Previously we reported that 
      juvenile snails Helix lucorum differ from adult animals in a spectrum of 
      transcription factors binding to DNA regulatory elements SRE and AP-1. In this study 
      we analyzed the expression and activation of MAPK/ERK in CNS of H. lucorum during 
      formation of the conditioned avoidance reflex at different stages of postnatal 
      ontogenesis. Under conditions of learning, juvenile snails (aged 2-3 months) 
      possessing immature mechanisms of avoidance reflex plasticity showed dramatically 
      low level of phosphorylation and, correspondingly, low activation of MAPK/ERK in 
      comparison to adult animals. Beside this, the MAPK/ERK cascade was not activated 
      after 10 and 60 min after learning in juvenile snails in contrast to adults, while 
      basal expression level of this kinase was similar in juveniles and adults. Low 
      activation of MAPK/ERK cascade can cause a deficiency in phosphorylation of 
      downstream transcription factors binding to SRE and thereby influence the expression 
      of early response genes (particularly, of the family AP-1) and late response genes 
      necessary for cellular and synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that the 
      MAPK/ERK regulatory cascade plays an essential role in the formation of conditioned 
      avoidance reflexes in Helix. Low activation of this cascade might be one of the 
      reasons for deficiency of long-term memory formation during avoidance learning in 
      juvenile animals.

TI  - Vulnerability of native savanna trees and exotic Khaya senegalensis to seasonal 
      drought.
PG  - 783-91
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpv037 [doi]
AB  - Seasonally dry ecosystems present a challenge to plants to maintain water relations. 
      While native vegetation in seasonally dry ecosystems have evolved specific 
      adaptations to the long dry season, there are risks to introduced exotic species. 
      African mahogany, Khaya senegalensis Desr. (A. Juss.), is an exotic plantation 
      species that has been introduced widely in Asia and northern Australia, but it is 
      unknown if it has the physiological or phenotypic plasticity to cope with the 
      strongly seasonal patterns of water availability in the tropical savanna climate of 
      northern Australia. We investigated the gas exchange and water relations traits and 
      adjustments to seasonal drought in K. senegalensis and native eucalypts (Eucalyptus 
      tetrodonta F. Muell. and Corymbia latifolia F. Muell.) in a savanna ecosystem in 
      northern Australia. The native eucalypts did not exhibit any signs of drought stress 
      after 3 months of no rainfall and probably had access to deeper soil moisture late 
      into the dry season. Leaf water potential, stomatal conductance, transpiration and 
      photosynthesis all remained high in the dry season but osmotic adjustment was not 
      observed. Overstorey leaf area index (LAI) was 0.6 in the native eucalypt savanna 
      and did not change between wet and dry seasons. In contrast, the K. senegalensis 
      plantation in the wet season was characterized by a high water potential, high 
      stomatal conductance and transpiration and a high LAI of 2.4. In the dry season, K. 
      senegalensis experienced mild drought stress with a predawn water potential -0.6 
      MPa. Overstorey LAI was halved, and stomatal conductance and transpiration 
      drastically reduced, while minimum leaf water potentials did not change (-2 MPa) and 
      no osmotic adjustment occurred. Khaya senegalensis exhibited an isohydric behaviour 
      and also had a lower hydraulic vulnerability to cavitation in leaves, with a P50 of 
      -2.3 MPa. The native eucalypts had twice the maximum leaf hydraulic conductance but 
      a much higher P50 of -1.5 MPa. Khaya senegalensis has evolved in a wet-dry tropical 
      climate in West Africa (600-800 mm) and appears to be well suited to the seasonal 
      savanna climate of northern Australia. The species exhibited a large phenotypic 
      plasticity through leaf area adjustments and conservative isohydric behaviour in the 
      6 months dry season while operating well above its critical hydraulic threshold.

TI  - Microbial environment shapes immune function and cloacal microbiota dynamics in 
      zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1186/s42523-020-00039-3 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relevance of the host microbiota to host ecology and evolution is 
      well acknowledged. However, the effect of the microbial environment on host immune 
      function and host microbiota dynamics is understudied in terrestrial vertebrates. 
      Using a novel experimental approach centered on the manipulation of the microbial 
      environment of zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, we carried out a study to 
      investigate effects of the host's microbial environment on: 1) constitutive immune 
      function, 2) the resilience of the host cloacal microbiota; and 3) the degree to 
      which immune function and host microbiota covary in microbial environments that 
      differ in diversity. RESULTS: We explored immune indices (hemagglutination, 
      hemolysis, IgY levels and haptoglobin concentration) and host-associated microbiota 
      (diversity and composition) in birds exposed to two experimental microbial 
      environments differing in microbial diversity. According to our expectations, 
      exposure to experimental microbial environments led to differences related to 
      specific antibodies: IgY levels were elevated in the high diversity treatment, 
      whereas we found no effects for the other immune indices. Furthermore, according to 
      predictions, we found significantly increased richness of dominant OTUs for cloacal 
      microbiota of birds of the high diversity compared with the low diversity group. In 
      addition, cloacal microbiota of individual females approached their baseline state 
      sooner in the low diversity environment than females in the high diversity 
      environment. This result supported a direct phenotypically plastic response of host 
      microbiota, and suggests that its resilience depends on environmental microbial 
      diversity. Finally, immune indices and cloacal microbiota composition tend to covary 
      within treatment groups, while at the same time, individuals exhibited consistent 
      differences of immune indices and microbiota characteristics. CONCLUSION: We show 
      that microbes in the surroundings of terrestrial vertebrates can influence immune 
      function and host-associated microbiota dynamics over relatively short time scales. 
      We suggest that covariation between immune indices and cloacal microbiota, in 
      addition to large and consistent differences among individuals, provides potential 
      for evolutionary adaptation. Ultimately, our study highlights that linking 
      environmental and host microbiotas may help unravelling immunological variation 
      within and potentially among species, and together these efforts will advance the 
      integration of microbial ecology and ecological immunology.

AB  - The presence of anthropogenic contaminants such as antimicrobials, flame-retardants, 
      and plasticizers in runoff from agricultural fields applied with municipal biosolids 
      may pose a potential threat to the environment. This study assesses the potential 
      for rainfall-induced runoff of 69 anthropogenic waste indicators (AWIs), widely 
      found in household and industrial products, from biosolids amended field plots. The 
      agricultural field containing the test plots was treated with biosolids for the 
      first time immediately prior to this study. AWIs present in soil and biosolids were 
      isolated by continuous liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by full-scan gas 
      chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results for 18 AWIs were not evaluated due to 
      their presence in field blank QC samples, and another 34 did not have sufficient 
      detection frequency in samples to analyze trends in data. A total of 17 AWIs, 
      including 4-nonylphenol, triclosan, and tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, were present 
      in runoff with acceptable data quality and frequency for subsequent interpretation. 
      Runoff samples were collected 5days prior to and 1, 9, and 35days after biosolids 
      application. Of the 17 AWIs considered, 14 were not detected in pre-application 
      samples, or their concentrations were much smaller than in the sample collected one 
      day after application. A range of trends was observed for individual AWI 
      concentrations (typically from 0.1 to 10μg/L) over the course of the study, 
      depending on the combination of partitioning and degradation mechanisms affecting 
      each compound most strongly. Overall, these results indicate that rainfall can 
      mobilize anthropogenic contaminants from biosolids-amended agricultural fields, 
      directly to surface waters and redistribute them to terrestrial sites away from the 
      point of application via runoff. For 14 of 17 compounds examined, the potential for 
      runoff remobilization during rainstorms persists even after three 100-year 
      rainstorm-equivalent simulations and the passage of a month.

TI  - Occurrence and Gas-Particle Partitioning of Organic UV-Filters in Urban Air.
PG  - 12881-12889
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.0c02665 [doi]
AB  - A retrospective analysis of a comprehensive series of high-volume air samples (n = 
      70) collected during 2010-2011 in Toronto (Canada) was performed. Seven UV compounds 
      were analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) with sum of 
      concentrations (gas + particle phase) ranging from 80 to 2030 pg/m(3). Homosalate 
      (HMS) was the most prevalent organic UV-filter in air (47% of the total 
      concentration), followed by 2-ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS, ∼29%), E- and 
      Z-2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC, ∼17%). Ambient air (gas + particle phase) 
      concentrations of organic UV-filters showed a strong seasonality, with peak levels 
      during the summer. An analysis of Clausius-Clapeyron slopes indicated that much of 
      the ambient burden of organic UV-filters are explained by volatilization from 
      terrestrial and aquatic surfaces and supplemented with human activities and use of 
      lotions and sunscreens, containing organic UV-filters, in addition to its use in 
      plastics, textiles, paints, and pesticides. The results showed that organic 
      UV-filters exist mainly in the gas phase with some exceptions, for instance, 
      octocrylene (OCR), which was associated with both gas and particle phases, and 
      avobenzone (AVB), which was predominantly in the particle phase. Lastly, this study 
      revealed the need for basic physical chemical property data for organic UV-filters, 
      including information on transformation rates and products, for better evaluating 
      their environmental fate and effects.

TI  - Unusual developmental morphology and anatomy of vegetative organs in Utricularia 
      dichotoma-leaf, shoot and root dynamics.
PG  - 371-390
LID - 10.1007/s00709-019-01443-6 [doi]
AB  - The terrestrial carnivorous species Utricularia dichotoma is known for a great 
      phenotypic plasticity and unusual vegetative organs. Our investigation on 22 
      sources/populations revealed that after initiation of a leaf and two bladders on a 
      stolon, a bud was formed in the proximal axil of the leaf, developing into a rosette 
      with up to seven organs. The first two primordia of the bud grew into almost every 
      possible combination of organs, but often into two anchor stolons. The patterns were 
      generally not population specific. The interchangeability of organs increased with 
      increasing rank in the succession of organs on stolon nodes. A high potential of 
      switching developmental programs may be successful in a fluctuating environment. In 
      this respect, we were able to show that bladders developed from anchor stolons 
      experimentally when raising the water table. Anatomical structures were simple, 
      lacunate and largely homogenous throughout all organs. They showed similarities with 
      many hydrophytes, reflecting the plant's adaptation to (temporarily) submerged 
      conditions. The principal component analysis was used in the context of dynamic 
      morphology to illustrate correlations between organ types in the morphospace of U. 
      dichotoma, revealing an organ specific patchwork of developmental processes for 
      typical leaves and shoots, and less pronounced for a typical root. The concept and 
      methods we applied may prove beneficial for future studies on the evolution of 
      Lentibulariaceae, and on developmental morphology and genetics of unusual structures 
      in plants.

TI  - Adaptation of a polyphagous herbivore to a novel host plant extensively shapes the 
      transcriptome of herbivore and host.
PG  - 4647-63
LID - 10.1111/mec.13330 [doi]
AB  - Generalist arthropod herbivores rapidly adapt to a broad range of host plants. 
      However, the extent of transcriptional reprogramming in the herbivore and its hosts 
      associated with adaptation remains poorly understood. Using the spider mite 
      Tetranychus urticae and tomato as models with available genomic resources, we 
      investigated the reciprocal genomewide transcriptional changes in both spider mite 
      and tomato as a consequence of mite's adaptation to tomato. We transferred a 
      genetically diverse mite population from bean to tomato where triplicated 
      populations were allowed to propagate for 30 generations. Evolving populations 
      greatly increased their reproductive performance on tomato relative to their 
      progenitors when reared under identical conditions, indicative of genetic 
      adaptation. Analysis of transcriptional changes associated with mite adaptation to 
      tomato revealed two main components. First, adaptation resulted in a set of mite 
      genes that were constitutively downregulated, independently of the host. These genes 
      were mostly of an unknown function. Second, adapted mites mounted an altered 
      transcriptional response that had greater amplitude of changes when re-exposed to 
      tomato, relative to nonadapted mites. This gene set was enriched in genes encoding 
      detoxifying enzymes and xenobiotic transporters. Besides the direct effects on mite 
      gene expression, adaptation also indirectly affected the tomato transcriptional 
      responses, which were attenuated upon feeding of adapted mites, relative to the 
      induced responses by nonadapted mite feeding. Thus, constitutive downregulation and 
      increased transcriptional plasticity of genes in a herbivore may play a central role 
      in adaptation to host plants, leading to both a higher detoxification potential and 
      reduced production of plant defence compounds.

AB  - Genetic programs underlying multicellular morphogenesis and cellular differentiation 
      are most often associated with eukaryotic organisms, but examples also exist in 
      bacteria such as the formation of multicellular, spore-filled fruiting bodies in the 
      order Myxococcales. Most members of the Myxococcales undergo a multicellular 
      developmental program culminating in the formation of spore-filled fruiting bodies 
      in response to starvation. To gain insight into the evolutionary history of fruiting 
      body formation in Myxococcales, we performed a comparative analysis of the genomes 
      and transcriptomes of five Myxococcales species, four of these undergo fruiting body 
      formation (Myxococcus xanthus, Stigmatella aurantiaca, Sorangium cellulosum, and 
      Haliangium ochraceum) and one does not (Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans). Our analyses 
      show that a set of 95 known M. xanthus development-specific genes--although 
      suffering from a sampling bias--are overrepresented and occur more frequently than 
      an average M. xanthus gene in S. aurantiaca, whereas they occur at the same 
      frequency as an average M. xanthus gene in S. cellulosum and in H. ochraceum and are 
      underrepresented in A. dehalogenans. Moreover, genes for entire signal transduction 
      pathways important for fruiting body formation in M. xanthus are conserved in S. 
      aurantiaca, whereas only a minority of these genes are conserved in A. dehalogenans, 
      S. cellulosum, and H. ochraceum. Likewise, global gene expression profiling of 
      developmentally regulated genes showed that genes that upregulated during 
      development in M. xanthus are overrepresented in S. aurantiaca and slightly 
      underrepresented in A. dehalogenans, S. cellulosum, and H. ochraceum. These 
      comparative analyses strongly indicate that the genetic programs for fruiting body 
      formation in M. xanthus and S. aurantiaca are highly similar and significantly 
      different from the genetic program directing fruiting body formation in S. 
      cellulosum and H. ochraceum. Thus, our analyses reveal an unexpected level of 
      plasticity in the genetic programs for fruiting body formation in the Myxococcales 
      and strongly suggest that the genetic program underlying fruiting body formation in 
      different Myxococcales is not conserved. The evolutionary implications of this 
      finding are discussed.

TI  - Hypergravity from conception to adult stage: effects on contractile properties and 
      skeletal muscle phenotype.
PG  - 2793-802
AB  - This study examined the effects of an elevation of the gravity factor 
      (hypergravity--2 g) on the molecular and functional characteristics of rat soleus 
      and plantaris muscles. Long Evans rats were conceived, born and reared (CBR) 
      continuously in hypergravity conditions until the age of 100 days. Whole muscle 
      morphological parameters, Ca2+ activation characteristics from single skinned 
      fibers, troponin (Tn) subunit and myosin heavy (MHC) and light (MLC) chains isoform 
      compositions were examined in CBR and control muscles from age-paired terrestrial 
      rats. Decreases in body and muscle mass in soleus and plantaris muscles were 
      observed and associated, in the soleus, with a decrease in fiber diameter. The 
      specific force of CBR soleus fibers was increased, and correlated with the elevation 
      of Ca2+ affinity. This was accompanied by slow-to-slower TnC and TnI isoform 
      transitions and a rearrangement in TnT fast isoform content. The MHC transformations 
      of the soleus after hypergravity were associated with the up (down)-regulation of 
      the MHCI (MHCIIa) mRNA isoforms. The MLC2 phosphorylation state remained unchanged 
      in the soleus muscle. The results suggested that the gravity factor could interact 
      with rat muscle development and that hypergravity experiments could provide good 
      tools for the study of myofibrillar protein plasticity and their associated pathways 
      of regulation.

TI  - Insect Odorscapes: From Plant Volatiles to Natural Olfactory Scenes.
PG  - 972
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2019.00972 [doi]
LID - 972
AB  - Olfaction is an essential sensory modality for insects and their olfactory 
      environment is mostly made up of plant-emitted volatiles. The terrestrial vegetation 
      produces an amazing diversity of volatile compounds, which are then transported, 
      mixed, and degraded in the atmosphere. Each insect species expresses a set of 
      olfactory receptors that bind part of the volatile compounds present in its habitat. 
      Insect odorscapes are thus defined as species-specific olfactory spaces, dependent 
      on the local habitat, and dynamic in time. Manipulations of pest-insect odorscapes 
      are a promising approach to answer the strong demand for pesticide-free 
      plant-protection strategies. Moreover, understanding their olfactory environment 
      becomes a major concern in the context of global change and environmental stresses 
      to insect populations. A considerable amount of information is available on the 
      identity of volatiles mediating biotic interactions that involve insects. However, 
      in the large body of research devoted to understanding how insects use olfaction to 
      locate resources, an integrative vision of the olfactory environment has rarely been 
      reached. This article aims to better apprehend the nature of the insect odorscape 
      and its importance to insect behavioral ecology by reviewing the literature specific 
      to different disciplines from plant ecophysiology to insect neuroethology. First, we 
      discuss the determinants of odorscape composition, from the production of volatiles 
      by plants (section "Plant Metabolism and Volatile Emissions") to their filtering 
      during detection by the olfactory system of insects (section "Insect Olfaction: How 
      Volatile Plant Compounds Are Encoded and Integrated by the Olfactory System"). We 
      then summarize the physical and chemical processes by which volatile chemicals 
      distribute in space (section "Transportation of Volatile Plant Compounds and Spatial 
      Aspects of the Odorscape") and time (section "Temporal Aspects: The Dynamics of the 
      Odorscape") in the atmosphere. The following sections consider the ecological 
      importance of background odors in odorscapes and how insects adapt to their 
      olfactory environment. Habitat provides an odor background and a sensory context 
      that modulate the responses of insects to pheromones and other olfactory signals 
      (section "Ecological Importance of Odorscapes"). In addition, insects do not respond 
      inflexibly to single elements in their odorscape but integrate several components of 
      their environment (section "Plasticity and Adaptation to Complex and Variable 
      Odorscapes"). We finally discuss existing methods of odorscape manipulation for 
      sustainable pest insect control and potential future developments in the context of 
      agroecology (section "Odorscapes in Plant Protection and Agroecology").

TI  - Balance between carbon gain and loss under long-term drought: impacts on foliar 
      respiration and photosynthesis in Quercus ilex L.
PG  - 821-33
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv492 [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial carbon exchange is a key process of the global carbon cycle consisting 
      of a delicate balance between photosynthetic carbon uptake and respiratory release. 
      We have, however, a limited understanding how long-term decreases in precipitation 
      induced by climate change affect the boundaries and mechanisms of photosynthesis and 
      respiration. We examined the seasonality of photosynthetic and respiratory traits 
      and evaluated the adaptive mechanism of the foliar carbon balance of Quercus ilex L. 
      experiencing a long-term rainfall-exclusion experiment. Day respiration (Rd) but not 
      night respiration (Rn) was generally higher in the drought treatment leading to an 
      increased Rd/Rn ratio. The limitation of mesophyll conductance (gm) on 
      photosynthesis was generally stronger than stomatal limitation (gs) in the drought 
      treatment, reflected in a lower gm/gs ratio. The peak photosynthetic activity in the 
      drought treatment occurred in an atypical favourable summer in parallel with lower 
      Rd/Rn and higher gm/gs ratios. The plant carbon balance was thus strongly improved 
      through: (i) higher photosynthetic rates induced by gm; and (ii) decreased carbon 
      losses mediated by Rd. Interestingly, photosynthetic potentials (Vc,max, Jmax, and 
      TPU) were not affected by the drought treatment, suggesting a dampening effect on 
      the biochemical level in the long term. In summary, the trees experiencing a 
      14-year-long drought treatment adapted through higher plasticity in photosynthetic 
      and respiratory traits, so that eventually the atypical favourable growth period was 
      exploited more efficiently.

TI  - Microbial Communities Can Be Described by Metabolic Structure: A General Framework 
      and Application to a Seasonally Variable, Depth-Stratified Microbial Community from 
      the Coastal West Antarctic Peninsula.
PG  - e0135868
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0135868 [doi]
LID - e0135868
AB  - Taxonomic marker gene studies, such as the 16S rRNA gene, have been used to 
      successfully explore microbial diversity in a variety of marine, terrestrial, and 
      host environments. For some of these environments long term sampling programs are 
      beginning to build a historical record of microbial community structure. Although 
      these 16S rRNA gene datasets do not intrinsically provide information on microbial 
      metabolism or ecosystem function, this information can be developed by identifying 
      metabolisms associated with related, phenotyped strains. Here we introduce the 
      concept of metabolic inference; the systematic prediction of metabolism from 
      phylogeny, and describe a complete pipeline for predicting the metabolic pathways 
      likely to be found in a collection of 16S rRNA gene phylotypes. This framework 
      includes a mechanism for assigning confidence to each metabolic inference that is 
      based on a novel method for evaluating genomic plasticity. We applied this framework 
      to 16S rRNA gene libraries from the West Antarctic Peninsula marine environment, 
      including surface and deep summer samples and surface winter samples. Using 
      statistical methods commonly applied to community ecology data we found that 
      metabolic structure differed between summer surface and winter and deep samples, 
      comparable to an analysis of community structure by 16S rRNA gene phylotypes. While 
      taxonomic variance between samples was primarily driven by low abundance taxa, 
      metabolic variance was attributable to both high and low abundance pathways. This 
      suggests that clades with a high degree of functional redundancy can occupy distinct 
      adjacent niches. Overall our findings demonstrate that inferred metabolism can be 
      used in place of taxonomy to describe the structure of microbial communities. 
      Coupling metabolic inference with targeted metagenomics and an improved collection 
      of completed genomes could be a powerful way to analyze microbial communities in a 
      high-throughput manner that provides direct access to metabolic and ecosystem 
      function.

      towards attractants and away from repellents, thereby directing axon outgrowth. 
      Hence, actin binding proteins (ABPs) moved into the focus as critical regulators of 
      neuron connectivity. We found cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), an ABP with 
      unknown brain function, abundant in growth cones. Super-resolution microscopy and 
      live cell imaging combined with pharmacological approaches on hippocampal neurons 
      from gene-targeted mice revealed a crucial role for CAP1 in actin dynamics that is 
      critical for growth cone morphology and function. Growth cone defects in CAP1 
      knockout (KO) neurons compromised neuron differentiation and was associated with 
      impaired neuron connectivity in CAP1-KO brains. Mechanistically, by rescue 
      experiments in double KO neurons lacking CAP1 and the key actin regulator cofilin1, 
      we demonstrated that CAP1 was essential for cofilin1 function in growth cone actin 
      dynamics and morphology and vice versa. Together, we identified CAP1 as a novel 
      actin regulator in growth cones that was relevant for neuron connectivity, and we 
      demonstrated functional interdependence of CAP1 and cofilin1 in neuronal actin 
      dynamics and growth cone function.

AB  - Bison (Bison bison) are one of the few terrestrial megafauna to survive the 
      transition into the Holocene and provide a unique opportunity to study a species on 
      a broad spatiotemporal scale. Today, bison are primarily managed in small and 
      isolated herds with little known about their ancestral ecology. We studied the 
      carbon and nitrogen isotopes of Northern Great Plains bison from the terminal 
      Pleistocene and throughout the Holocene to gain insight into their paleoecology. 
      This time span is contemporary with the first population bottleneck experienced by 
      bison at the end of the Pleistocene and includes the second bottleneck which 
      occurred in the late 19(th) century. Results were compared with modern bison herd 
      isotopic values from Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP). Patterns of isotopic 
      variation found in bison over time indicate significant (δ(13)C p = 0.0008, δ(15)N 
      p = 0.002) differences in diet composition and correlate with climate throughout the 
      Holocene. Isotopic relationships described here reveal the plasticity of ancient 
      bison in unrestricted rangelands during periods of climatic fluctuations. Managers 
      at TRNP and elsewhere should pursue opportunities to expand bison range to maximize 
      forage opportunities for the species in the face of future environmental change.

TI  - Widespread drought-induced tree mortality at dry range edges indicates that climate 
      stress exceeds species' compensating mechanisms.
PG  - 3793-3802
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14771 [doi]
AB  - Drought-induced tree mortality is projected to increase due to climate change, which 
      will have manifold ecological and societal impacts including the potential to weaken 
      or reverse the terrestrial carbon sink. Predictions of tree mortality remain 
      limited, in large part because within-species variations in ecophysiology due to 
      plasticity or adaptation and ecosystem adjustments could buffer mortality in dry 
      locations. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of 50 studies spanning >100 woody plant 
      species globally to quantify how populations within species vary in vulnerability to 
      drought mortality and whether functional traits or climate mediate mortality 
      patterns. We find that mortality predominantly occurs in drier populations and this 
      pattern is more pronounced in species with xylem that can tolerate highly negative 
      water potentials, typically considered to be an adaptive trait for dry regions, and 
      species that experience higher variability in water stress. Our results indicate 
      that climate stress has exceeded physiological and ecosystem-level tolerance or 
      compensating mechanisms by triggering extensive mortality at dry range edges and 
      provides a foundation for future mortality projections in empirical distribution and 
      mechanistic vegetation models.

TI  - Environmental fluctuation governs selection for plasticity in biofilm production.
PG  - 1569-1577
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2017.33 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria can grow in a free-swimming state, as planktonic cells, or in 
      surface-attached communities, termed biofilms. The planktonic and biofilm growth 
      modes differ dramatically with respect to spatial constraints, nutrient access, 
      population density and cell-cell interactions. Fitness trade-offs underlie how 
      successfully bacteria compete in each of these environments. Accordingly, some 
      bacteria have evolved to be specialists in biofilm formation, while others 
      specialize in planktonic growth. There are species, however, that possess flexible 
      strategies: they can transition between the molecular programs required for biofilm 
      formation and for planktonic growth. Such flexible strategies often sacrifice 
      competitive ability against specialists in a given habitat. There is little 
      exploration of the ecological conditions favoring the evolution of the flexible 
      biofilm production strategy for bacteria in competition with specialist biofilm 
      producers or specialist non-producers. Here, we study the human pathogen Vibrio 
      cholerae, a flexible biofilm-former, as well as constitutive biofilm-producing and 
      non-producing mutants. We assess the fitness of these strains under biofilm 
      conditions, planktonic conditions and conditions that demand the ability to 
      transition between the two growth modes. We show that, relative to the specialists, 
      the wild type is superior at dispersal from biofilms to the planktonic phase; 
      however, this capability comes at the expense of reduced competitive fitness against 
      constitutive biofilm producers on surfaces. Wild-type V. cholerae can outcompete the 
      constitutive biofilm producers and non-producers if habitat turnover is sufficiently 
      frequent. Thus, selection for phenotypic flexibility in biofilm production depends 
      on the frequency of environmental fluctuations encountered by bacteria.

TI  - Genetic and epigenetic differences associated with environmental gradients in 
      replicate populations of two salt marsh perennials.
PG  - 1639-52
LID - 10.1111/mec.13522 [doi]
AB  - While traits and trait plasticity are partly genetically based, investigating 
      epigenetic mechanisms may provide more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms 
      underlying response to environment. Using AFLP and methylation-sensitive AFLP, we 
      tested the hypothesis that differentiation to habitats along natural salt marsh 
      environmental gradients occurs at epigenetic, but not genetic loci in two salt marsh 
      perennials. We detected significant genetic and epigenetic structure among 
      populations and among subpopulations, but we found multilocus patterns of 
      differentiation to habitat type only in epigenetic variation for both species. In 
      addition, more epigenetic than genetic loci were correlated with habitat in both 
      species. When we analysed genetic and epigenetic variation simultaneously with 
      partial Mantel, we found no correlation between genetic variation and habitat and a 
      significant correlation between epigenetic variation and habitat in Spartina 
      alterniflora. In Borrichia frutescens, we found significant correlations between 
      epigenetic and/or genetic variation and habitat in four of five populations when 
      populations were analysed individually, but there was no significant correlation 
      between genetic or epigenetic variation and habitat when analysed jointly across the 
      five populations. These analyses suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in 
      the response to salt marsh habitats, but also that the relationships among genetic 
      and epigenetic variation and habitat vary by species. Site-specific conditions may 
      also cloud our ability to detect response in replicate populations with similar 
      environmental gradients. Future studies analysing sequence data and the correlation 
      between genetic variation and DNA methylation will be powerful to identify the 
      contributions of genetic and epigenetic response to environmental gradients.

TI  - Direct and indirect genetic effects in life-history traits of flour beetles 
      (Tribolium castaneum).
PG  - 207-17
LID - 10.1111/evo.12835 [doi]
AB  - Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are the basis of social interactions among 
      conspecifics, and can affect genetic variation of nonsocial and social traits. We 
      used flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) of two phenotypically distinguishable 
      populations to estimate genetic (co)variances and the effect of IGEs on three 
      life-history traits: development time (DT), growth rate (GR), and pupal body mass 
      (BM). We found that GR was strongly affected by social environment with IGEs 
      accounting for 18% of the heritable variation. We also discovered a sex-specific 
      social effect: male ratio in a group significantly affected both GR and BM; that is, 
      beetles grew larger and faster in male-biased social environments. Such sex-specific 
      IGEs have not previously been demonstrated in a nonsocial insect. Our results show 
      that beetles that achieve a higher BM do so via a slower GR in response to social 
      environment. Existing models of evolution in age-structured or stage-structured 
      populations do not account for IGEs of social cohorts. It is likely that such IGEs 
      have played a key role in the evolution of developmental plasticity shown by 
      Tenebrionid larvae in response to density. Our results document an important source 
      of genetic variation for GR, often overlooked in life-history theory.

TI  - Critical thermal limits depend on methodological context.
PG  - 2935-42
AB  - A full-factorial study of the effects of rates of temperature change and start 
      temperatures was undertaken for both upper and lower critical thermal limits (CTLs) 
      using the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes. Results show that rates of temperature 
      change and start temperatures have highly significant effects on CTLs, although the 
      duration of the experiment also has a major effect. Contrary to a widely held 
      expectation, slower rates of temperature change (i.e. longer experimental duration) 
      resulted in poorer thermal tolerance at both high and low temperatures. Thus, across 
      treatments, a negative relationship existed between duration and upper CTL while a 
      positive relationship existed between duration and lower CTL. Most importantly, for 
      predicting tsetse distribution, G. pallidipes suffer loss of function at less severe 
      temperatures under the most ecologically relevant experimental conditions for upper 
      (0.06 degrees C min(-1); 35 degrees C start temperature) and lower CTL (0.06 degrees 
      C min(-1); 24 degrees C start temperature). This suggests that the functional 
      thermal range of G. pallidipes in the wild may be much narrower than previously 
      suspected, approximately 20-40 degrees C, and highlights their sensitivity to even 
      moderate temperature variation. These effects are explained by limited plasticity of 
      CTLs in this species over short time scales. The results of the present study have 
      broad implications for understanding temperature tolerance in these and other 
      terrestrial arthropods.

TI  - The corneal surface of aquatic vertebrates: microstructures with optical and 
      nutritional function?
PG  - 1171-6
AB  - The anterior surface of the mammalian cornea plays an important role in maintaining 
      a smooth optical interface and consequently a sharp retinal image. The smooth 
      surface is produced by a tear film, which adheres to a variety of microprojections, 
      which increase the cell surface area, improve the absorbance of oxygen and nutrients 
      and aid in the movement of metabolic products across the outer cell membrane. 
      However, little is known of the structural adaptations and tear film support 
      provided in other vertebrates from different environments. Using field emission 
      scanning electron microscopy; this study examines the density and surface structure 
      of corneal epithelial cells in representative species of the classes 
      Cephalaspidomorphi, Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and 
      Mammalia, including some Marsupialia. Variations in cell density and the structure 
      and occurrence of microholes, microridges, microplicae and microvilli are described 
      with respect to the demands placed upon the cornea in different aquatic environments 
      such as marine and freshwater. A progressive decrease in epithelial cell density 
      occurs from marine (e.g. 29348 cells mm(-2) in the Dover sole Microstomius pacficus) 
      to estuarine or freshwater (e.g. 5999 cells mm(-2) in the black bream Acanthopagrus 
      butcheri) to terrestrial (e.g. 2126 cells mm(-2) in the Australian koala 
      Phascolarctos cinereus) vertebrates, indicating the reduction in osmotic stress 
      across the corneal surface. The microholes found in the Southern Hemisphere 
      lampreys, namely the pouched lamprey (Geotria australis) and the shorthead lamprey 
      (Mordacia mordax) represent openings for the release of mucus, which may protect the 
      cornea from abrasion during their burrowing phase. Characteristic of marine 
      teleosts, fingerprint-like patterns of corneal microridges are a ubiquitous feature, 
      covering many types of sensory epithelia (including the olfactory epithelium and the 
      oral mucosa). Like microplicae and microvilli, microridges stabilize the tear film 
      to maintain a smooth optical surface and increase the surface area of the 
      epithelium, assisting in diffusion and active transport. The clear interspecific 
      differences in corneal surface structure suggest an adaptive plasticity in the 
      composition and stabilization of the corneal tear film in various aquatic 
      environments.

TI  - The impact of NO (inf3)(sup-) loading on the freshwater macrophyte Littorella 
      uniflora: N utilization strategy in a slow-growing species from oligotrophic 
      habitats.
PG  - 368-378
LID - 10.1007/BF00317857 [doi]
AB  - The decline and disappearance of Littorella uniflora from oligotrophic waters which 
      have become eutrophic has been associated with shading or reduced CO(2) supply. 
      However NO (inf3)(sup-) concentrations can reach very high levels (100-2000 mmol 
      m(-3) compared with <1-3 in oligotrophic habitats). To investigate the impact of NO 
      (inf3)(sup-) loading alone, plants were grown under three NO (inf3)(sup-) regimes 
      (very low, near-natural and high). The interactive effects of NO (inf3)(sup-) and 
      photon flux density (low and high regimes) on N assimilation and accumulation, CO(2) 
      concentrating mechanisms, C(3) photosynthesis and growth were also examined. The 
      results were unexpected. Increased NO (inf3)(sup-) supply had very little effect on 
      photosynthetic capacity, crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or lacunal CO(2) 
      concentrations ([CO(2)](i)), although there was considerable plasticity with respect 
      to light regime. In contrast, increased NO (inf3)(sup-) supply resulted in a marked 
      accumulation of NO (inf3)(sup-) , free amino acids and soluble protein in shoots and 
      roots (up to 25 mol m(-3), 30 mol m(-3) and 9 mg g(-1) fresh weight respectively in 
      roots), while fresh weight and relative growth rate were reduced. Total N content 
      even under the very low NO (inf3)(sup-) regime (1.6-2.3%) was mid-range for aquatic 
      and terrestrial species (and 3.1-4.3% under the high NO (inf3)(sup-) regime). These 
      findings, together with field data, suggest that L. uniflora is not growth limited 
      by low NO (inf3)(sup-) supply in natural oligotophic habitats, due not to an 
      efficient photosynthetic nitrogen use but to a slow growth rate, a low N requirement 
      and to the use of storage to avoid N stress. However the increased NO (inf3)(sup-) 
      concentrations in eutrophic environments seem likely have detrimental effects on the 
      long-term survival of L. uniflora, possibly as a consequence of N accumulation.

TI  - The morphological diversity of the quadrate bone in squamate reptiles as revealed by 
      high-resolution computed tomography and geometric morphometrics.
PG  - 210-227
LID - 10.1111/joa.13102 [doi]
AB  - We examined the morphological diversity of the quadrate bone in squamate reptiles 
      (i.e. lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians). The quadrate is the principal 
      splanchnocranial element involved in suspending the lower jaw from the skull, and 
      its shape is of particular interest because it is potentially affected by several 
      factors, such as phylogenetic history, allometry, ecology, skull kinesis and hearing 
      capabilities (e.g. presence or absence of a tympanic ear). Due to its complexity, 
      the quadrate bone is also considered one of the most diagnostic elements in 
      fragmentary fossil taxa. We describe quadrates from 38 species spread across all 
      major squamate clades, using qualitative and quantitative (e.g. geometric 
      morphometrics) methods. We test for possible correlations between shape variation 
      and factors such as phylogeny, size, ecology and presence/absence of a tympanum. Our 
      results show that the shape of the quadrate is highly evolutionarily plastic, with 
      very little of the diversity explained by phylogenetic history. Size variation 
      (allometric scaling) is similarly unable to explain much shape diversity in the 
      squamate quadrate. Ecology (terrestrial/fossorial/aquatic) and presence of a 
      tympanic ear are more significant, but together explain only about 20% of the 
      diversity observed. Other unexplored and more analytically complex factors, such as 
      skull biomechanics, likely play additional major roles in shaping the quadrates of 
      lizards and snakes.

AB  - The present study focuses on the optimization of the bioprocess for the fermentative 
      production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Acinetobacter junii BP 25 using rice 
      mill effluent as a cheap substrate, henceforth to develop an economically feasible 
      biopolymer production process. Statistical tools like Plackett-Burman design (PBD) 
      and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) were used to evaluate the important variables 
      that influence the yield of PHA. Initially from PBD three factors (glycerol, 
      KH(2)PO(4) and incubation time) were taken for further optimization using 
      Box-Behnken design where, the interaction between each of the factors were studied 
      in detail, providing a final optimized media for the high concentration of PHA. 
      Before the optimization process the concentration of PHA was 0.52 ± 0.05 g/l for 
      1.07 ± 0.32 g/l cell dry mass (CDM) after which a 5.84 fold increase in PHA 
      concentration was observed with 3.04 g/l of PHA. Biodegradation studies of the 
      produced PHA sheets were investigated briefly in both terrestrial and aquatic 
      ecosystem, showing degradation within 8 weeks in soil and 4 weeks in water which was 
      very promising, as the non-degrading property of the conventional plastic have made 
      scientist to research on biopolymers mainly.

AB  - It was documented that arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) play an important role in 
      protecting host plants against arsenic (As) contamination. However, most terrestrial 
      ecosystems contain a considerable number of nonmycorrhizal plants. So far little 
      information is available for the interaction of such non-host plants with AMF under 
      As contaminations. By using a dual compartment cultivation system with a plastic 
      board or a nylon mesh separating roots of non-host pepperweed from roots of the 
      AM-host alfafa plants, avoiding direct root competition, the two plant species were 
      grown separately or partially separated (with rhizosphere effects) in the presence 
      or absence of the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis in As-contaminated soil. The results 
      indicated that mycorrhiza caused phosphorus (P) concentration decrease in the 
      non-host pepperweed, but promoted the P concentration of the AM host alfafa. 
      Mycorrhiza is potentially helpful for non-host pepperweed to adapt to As 
      contamination by decreasing root As concentration and showing no suppressing effect 
      on biomass production. The study provides further evidence for the protective 
      effects of AMF on non-host plants against As contamination, and improved our 
      understanding of the potential role of AMF for non-host plant adaptation to As 
      contaminated soils.

TI  - Modeling Study of a Proposed Field Calibration Source Using K-40 and High-Z Targets 
      for Sodium Iodide Detectors.
PG  - 563-70
LID - 10.1097/HP.0000000000000504 [doi]
AB  - Calibration sources based on the primordial isotope potassium-40 (K) have reduced 
      controls on the source's activity due to its terrestrial ubiquity and very low 
      specific activity. Potassium-40's beta emissions and 1,460.8 keV gamma ray can be 
      used to induce K-shell fluorescence x rays in high-Z metals between 60 and 80 keV. A 
      gamma ray calibration source that uses potassium chloride salt and a high-Z metal to 
      create a two-point calibration for a sodium iodide field gamma spectroscopy 
      instrument is thus proposed. The calibration source was designed in collaboration 
      with the Sandia National Laboratory using the Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended 
      (MCNPX) transport code. Two methods of x-ray production were explored. First, a thin 
      high-Z layer (HZL) was interposed between the detector and the potassium 
      chloride-urethane source matrix. Second, bismuth metal powder was homogeneously 
      mixed with a urethane binding agent to form a potassium chloride-bismuth matrix 
      (KBM). The bismuth-based source was selected as the development model because it is 
      inexpensive, nontoxic, and outperforms the high-Z layer method in simulation. Based 
      on the MCNPX studies, sealing a mixture of bismuth powder and potassium chloride 
      into a thin plastic case could provide a light, inexpensive field calibration 
      source.

TI  - Natural radioactivity in the soil samples of Coastal Karnataka of South India.
PG  - 24-33
AB  - Studies on radiation level and radionuclide distribution in the region of Coastal 
      Karnataka, India, were undertaken. The purpose of this study is to provide baseline 
      data on radiation level and radionuclide distribution in the region for the future 
      assessment of the impact of the nuclear and thermal power stations that are being 
      set up in the region. Further, this study may reveal information on the 
      transportation of radionuclides in the environment. The external gamma dose rates in 
      air have been measured throughout Coastal Karnataka using a sensitive plastic 
      scintillometer. The measured dose rates include both terrestrial and cosmic ray 
      components. The gamma dose rates in air range from 26 to 174 nGy h(-1) with a median 
      value of 74 nGy h(-1). The activities of naturally occurring radionuclides in the 
      soil samples of the region were measured using HPGe gamma ray spectrometry, and the 
      resulting doses in air were calculated. The activity of 40K varies from 61.0 to 
      316.7 Bq kg(-1) with a median of 117.5 Bq kg(-1); the activity of 226Ra varies from 
      20.1 to 62.3 Bq kg(-1) with a median value 35.0 Bq kg(-1) and that of 232Th from 
      14.3 to 48.6 Bq kg(-1) with a median value of 29.8 Bq kg(-1). The mean absorbed dose 
      rate in air due to naturally occurring radionuclides is found to be 41.5 nGy h(-1). 
      In addition to this, the correlations between 226Ra and 40K, 232Th and 40K, and 
      226Ra and 232Th were computed from the results of the concentration of these 
      naturally occurring radionuclides. A weak correlation was observed between 226Ra and 
      40K and between 232Th and 40K while a moderately good correlation was observed 
      between 226Ra and 232Th. The results of these systematic investigations are 
      presented and discussed in this paper.

AB  - A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste 
      produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. 
      Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. 
      Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into 
      biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a 
      necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in 
      developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae 
      growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in 
      microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support 
      robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which 
      is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live 
      cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The 
      gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a 
      competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light 
      (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at 
      the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which 
      were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural 
      variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive 
      selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA 
      processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These 
      data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite 
      transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production 
      system.

TI  - Wood biosynthesis and typologies: a molecular rhapsody.
PG  - 839-55
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpu031 [doi]
AB  - Wood represents one of the most important renewable commodities for humanity and 
      plays a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystem carbon-cycling. Wood formation is the 
      result of a multitude of events that require the concerted action of endogenous and 
      exogenous factors under the influence of photoperiod, for instance genes and plant 
      growth regulators. Beyond providing mechanical support and being responsible for the 
      increase in stem radial diameter, woody tissues constitute the vascular system of 
      trees and are capable of reacting to environmental stimuli, and as such are 
      therefore quite plastic and responsive. Despite the ecological and economic 
      importance of wood, not all aspects of its formation have been unveiled. Many gaps 
      in our knowledge are still present, which hinder the maximal exploitation of this 
      precious bioresource. This review aims at surveying the current knowledge of wood 
      formation and the available molecular data addressing the relationship between wood 
      production and environmental factors, which have crucial influences on the rhythmic 
      regulation of cambial activity and exert profound effects on tree stem growth, wood 
      yield and properties. We will here go beyond wood sensu stricto, i.e., secondary 
      xylem, and extend our survey to other tissues, namely vascular cambium, phloem and 
      fibres. The purpose is to provide the reader with an overview of the complexity of 
      the topic and to highlight the importance of progressing in the future towards an 
      integrated knowledge on the subject.

TI  - Calmodulin concentrated at the osteoclast ruffled border modulates acid secretion.
PG  - 17-28
AB  - Osteoclasts mediate acid dissolution of bone for maintenance of serum [Ca2+] and for 
      replacement of old bone in terrestrial vertebrates. Recent findings point to the 
      importance of intracellular signals, particularly Ca2+, in osteoclast regulation. 
      However, acid degradation of bone mineral subjects the osteoclast to uniquely high 
      extracellular [Ca2+]. We hypothesized that this high calcium environment would 
      affect calcium signalling mechanisms, and studied the calcium binding regulatory 
      protein, calmodulin, in the osteoclast. Avian osteoclast bone resorption was 
      inhibited 30% at 1 microM and 90% at 7 microM by the calmodulin antagonist 
      trifluoperazine. Osteoclast bone attachment was not affected by 10 microM 
      trifluoperazine. Quantitative immunofluorescence using fluorescein-labelled 
      calmodulin monoclonal antibody showed a severalfold increase of calmodulin 
      concentration in bone attached relative to plastic attached osteoclasts. Western 
      blots confirmed this, showing two to threefold increased osteoclast calmodulin per 
      milligram of cell protein in 3-day bone-attached vs. nonattached cells. Scanning 
      confocal microscopy showed calmodulin polarization to areas of bone attachment. 
      Electron micrographs with 9 nm colloidal gold labelling showed calmodulin in the 
      acid secreting ruffled membrane. ATP-dependent acid transport in osteoclast membrane 
      vesicles was inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium. This effect was 
      reversed by addition of excess calmodulin, showing that the inhibition is specific. 
      Vesicle acid transport inhibition reflects an approximately fourfold shift in the 
      apparent Km for ATP of vesicular acid transport in the presence of the calmodulin 
      antagonist. We conclude that calmodulin concentration and distribution is modified 
      by bone attachment, and that osteoclastic acid secretion is calmodulin regulated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasticity in foraging behavior among individuals, or across populations 
      may reduce competition. As a generalist carnivore, western gulls (Larus 
      occidentalis) consume a wide range of marine and terrestrial foods. However, the 
      foraging patterns and habitat selection (ocean or land) of western gulls is not well 
      understood, despite their ubiquity in coastal California. Here, we used GPS loggers 
      to compare the foraging behavior and habitat use of western gulls breeding at two 
      island colonies in central California. RESULTS: Gulls from offshore Southeast 
      Farallon Island (SFI; n = 41 gulls) conducted more oceanic trips (n = 90) of shorter 
      duration (3.8 ± 3.3 SD hours) and distance (27.1 ± 20.3 km) than trips to the 
      mainland (n = 41) which were nearly 4 times longer and 2 times farther away. In 
      contrast, gulls from coastal Año Nuevo Island (ANI; n = 20 gulls) foraged at sites 
      on land more frequently (n = 103) but trip durations (3.6 ± 2.4 h) and distances 
      (20.8 ± 9.4 km) did not differ significantly from oceanic trips (n = 42) where trip 
      durations were only slightly shorter (2.9 ± 2.7 h) and equidistant (20.6 ± 12.1 km). 
      Gulls from both colonies visited more sites while foraging at sea but spent 
      significantly longer (3-5 times) durations at each site visited on land. Foraging at 
      sea was also more random compared to foraging trips over land where gulls from both 
      colonies visited the same sites on multiple trips. The total home range of gulls 
      from SFI (14,230 km(2)) was 4.5 times larger than that of gulls from ANI, consistent 
      with greater resource competition resulting from a larger abundance of seabirds at 
      SFI. CONCLUSIONS: Population-level plasticity in foraging behavior was evident and 
      dependent on habitat type. In addition, gulls from SFI were away foraging longer 
      than gulls from ANI (22% vs. 7.5%, respectively), which impacts the defense of 
      territories and attempts at nest predation by conspecifics. Our results can be used 
      to explain lower chick productivity at SFI, and can provide insight into increased 
      gull activity in urban areas.

TI  - Drought soil legacy overrides maternal effects on plant growth.
PG  - 1400-1410
LID - 10.1111/1365-2435.13341 [doi]
AB  - Maternal effects (i.e. trans-generational plasticity) and soil legacies generated by 
      drought and plant diversity can affect plant performance and alter nutrient cycling 
      and plant community dynamics. However, the relative importance and combined effects 
      of these factors on plant growth dynamics remain poorly understood.We used soil and 
      seeds from an existing plant diversity and drought manipulation field experiment in 
      temperate grassland to test maternal, soil drought and diversity legacy effects, and 
      their interactions, on offspring plant performance of two grassland species 
      (Alopecurus pratensis and Holcus lanatus) under contrasting glasshouse 
      conditions.Our results showed that drought soil legacy effects eclipsed maternal 
      effects on plant biomass. Drought soil legacy effects were attributed to changes in 
      both abiotic (i.e. nutrient availability) and biotic soil properties (i.e. microbial 
      carbon and enzyme activity), as well as plant root and shoot atom (15)N excess. 
      Further, plant tissue nutrient concentrations and soil microbial C:N responses to 
      drought legacies varied between the two plant species and soils from high and low 
      plant diversity treatments. However, these diversity effects did not affect plant 
      root or shoot biomass.These findings demonstrate that while maternal effects 
      resulting from drought occur in grasslands, their impacts on plant performance are 
      likely minor relative to drought legacy effects on soil abiotic and biotic 
      properties. This suggests that soil drought legacy effects could become increasingly 
      important drivers of plant community dynamics and ecosystem functioning as extreme 
      weather events become more frequent and intense with climate change. A plain 
      language summary is available for this article.

PG  - 12479-12491
LID - 10.1002/ece3.4601 [doi]
AB  - Increased drought is forecasted for tropical regions, with severe implications for 
      the health and function of forest ecosystems. How mature forest trees will respond 
      to water deficit is poorly known. We investigated wood anatomy and leaf traits in 
      lowland tropical forest trees after 24 months of experimental rainfall exclusion. 
      Sampling sun-exposed young canopy branches from target species, we found 
      species-specific systematic variation in hydraulic-related wood anatomy and leaf 
      traits in response to drought stress. Relative to controls, drought-affected 
      individuals of different tree species variously exhibited trait measures consistent 
      with increasing hydraulic safety. These included narrower or less vessels, reduced 
      vessel groupings, lower theoretical water conductivities, less water storage tissue 
      and more abundant fiber in their wood, and more occluded vessels. Drought-affected 
      individuals also had thinner leaves, and more negative pre-dawn or mid-day leaf 
      water potentials. Future studies examining both wood and leaf hydraulic traits 
      should improve the representation of plant hydraulics within terrestrial ecosystem 
      and biosphere models, and help fine-tune predictions of how future climate changes 
      will affect tropical forests globally.

TI  - A high-resolution approach for the spatiotemporal analysis of forest canopy space 
      using terrestrial laser scanning data.
PG  - 6800-6811
LID - 10.1002/ece3.4193 [doi]
AB  - Forest canopies and tree crown structures are of high ecological importance. 
      Measuring canopies and crowns by direct inventory methods is time-consuming and of 
      limited accuracy. High-resolution inventory tools, in particular terrestrial laser 
      scanning (TLS), is able to overcome these limitations and obtain three-dimensional 
      (3D) structural information about the canopy with a very high level of detail. The 
      main objective of this study was to introduce a novel method to analyze 
      spatiotemporal dynamics in canopy occupancy at the individual tree and local 
      neighborhood level using high-resolution 3D TLS data. For the analyses, a voxel grid 
      approach was applied. The tree crowns were modeled through the combination of two 
      approaches: the encasement of all crown points with a 3D α-shape, which was then 
      converted into a voxel grid, and the direct voxelization of the crown points. We 
      show that canopy occupancy at individual tree level can be quantified as the crown 
      volume occupied only by the respective tree or shared with neighboring trees. At the 
      local neighborhood level, our method enables the precise determination of the extent 
      of canopy space filling, the identification of tree-tree interactions, and the 
      analysis of complementary space use. Using multitemporal TLS data recordings, this 
      method allows the precise detection and quantification of changes in canopy 
      occupancy through time. The method is applicable to a wide range of investigations 
      in forest ecology research, including the study of tree diversity effects on forest 
      productivity or growing space analyses for optimal tree growth. Due to the high 
      accuracy of this novel method, it facilitates the precise analyses even of highly 
      plastic individual tree crowns and, thus, the realistic representation of forest 
      canopies. Moreover, our voxel grid framework is flexible enough to allow for the 
      inclusion of further biotic and abiotic variables relevant to complex analyses of 
      forest canopy dynamics.

TI  - Trophic niche segregation allows range-extending coral reef fishes to co-exist with 
      temperate species under climate change.

AB  - Changing climate is forcing many terrestrial and marine species to extend their 
      ranges poleward to stay within the bounds of their thermal tolerances. However, when 
      such species enter higher latitude ecosystems, they engage in novel interactions 
      with local species, such as altered predator-prey dynamics and competition for food. 
      Here, we evaluate the trophic overlap between range-extending and local fish species 
      along the east coast of temperate Australia, a hotspot for ocean warming and species 
      range extensions. Stable isotope ratios (δ(15) N and δ(13) C) of muscle tissue and 
      stomach content analysis were used to quantify overlap of trophic niche space 
      between vagrant tropical and local temperate fish communities along a 730 km (6°) 
      latitudinal gradient. Our study shows that in recipient temperate ecosystems, 
      sympatric tropical and temperate species do not overlap significantly in their 
      diet-even though they forage on broadly similar prey groups-and are therefore 
      unlikely to compete for trophic niche space. The tropical and temperate species we 
      studied, which are commonly found in shallow-water coastal environments, exhibited 
      moderately broad niche breadths and local-scale dietary plasticity, indicating 
      trophic generalism. We posit that because these species are generalists, they can 
      co-exist under current climate change, facilitating the existence of novel community 
      structures.

AB  - We explore hypothetical ecologies to explain diversity among predatory dinosaurs in 
      North America's medial Cretaceous, based on occurrence, tooth morphology, and stable 
      isotope analysis. The Mussentuchit local fauna, Utah, USA, is among the best-known 
      terrestrial vertebrate assemblages from the Cretaceous. Study samples include teeth 
      from six microvertebrate sites, ranging in depositional setting from distal 
      floodplain to channel lags. We recognize four theropod morphotypes: a comparatively 
      large theropod (morph 1), a medium-sized dromaeosaurid (morph 2), a small 
      dromaeosaurid (morph 3), and a tooth-morph similar to the genus Richardoestesia 
      (morph 4). These four morphotypes vary significantly in mean size, from 15.1 mm in 
      the largest theropod to 3.7 mm in Richardoestesia. Further, tooth representation 
      from two of the best-sampled microsites (representing a channel/splay and floodplain 
      deposit) show differing patterns of abundances with morphs 1 and 3 having roughly 
      the same abundance in both sites, while morph 2 was more abundant in the floodplain 
      setting and morph 4 was more abundant in the channel/splay. Stable isotope analysis 
      (δ(13)C; δ(18)O) of tooth carbonate from the theropod morphotypes, goniopholidid 
      crocodilians, and matrix (to test for diagenesis) from these sites were also 
      analyzed. The theropods show modest differences in δ(13)C values between each other, 
      with carbonate from the teeth of morphs 1, 3, and 4 being enriched in (13)C for the 
      channel/splay relative to the floodplain environments, possibly indicative of 
      dietary plasticity in these species. We hypothesize that these data indicate that 
      the Mussentuchit theropods had different niches within the predator guild, 
      suggesting plausible means by which ecospace was divided among the predatory 
      dinosaurs of the Mussentuchit local fauna.

TI  - Responses of insect herbivores and their food plants to wind exposure and the 
      importance of predation risk.
PG  - 1046-1057
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12835 [doi]
AB  - Wind is an important abiotic factor that influences an array of biological 
      processes, but it is rarely considered in studies on plant-herbivore interactions. 
      Here, we tested whether wind exposure could directly or indirectly affect the 
      performance of two insect herbivores, Plutella xylostella and Pieris brassicae, 
      feeding on Brassica nigra plants. In a greenhouse study using a factorial design, 
      B. nigra plants were exposed to different wind regimes generated by fans before and 
      after caterpillars were introduced on plants in an attempt to separate the effects 
      of direct and indirect wind exposure on herbivores. Wind exposure delayed flowering, 
      decreased plant height and increased leaf concentrations of amino acids and 
      glucosinolates. Plant-mediated effects of wind on herbivores, that is effects of 
      exposure of plants to wind prior to herbivore feeding, were generally small. 
      However, development time of both herbivores was extended and adult body mass of 
      P. xylostella was reduced when they were directly exposed to wind. By contrast, 
      wind-exposed adult P. brassicae butterflies were significantly larger, revealing a 
      trade-off between development time and adult size. Based on these results, we 
      conducted a behavioural experiment to study preference by an avian predator, the 
      great tit (Parus major) for last instar P. brassicae caterpillars on plants that 
      were exposed to either control (no wind) or wind (fan-exposed) treatments. Tits 
      captured significantly more caterpillars on still than on wind-exposed plants. Our 
      results suggest that P. brassicae caterpillars are able to perceive the abiotic 
      environment and to trade off the costs of extended development time against the 
      benefits of increased size depending on the perceived risk of predation mediated by 
      wind exposure. Such adaptive phenotypic plasticity in insects has not yet been 
      described in response to wind exposure.

TI  - Coprophagous features in carnivorous Nepenthes plants: a task for ureases.
PG  - 11647

LID - 11647
AB  - Most terrestrial carnivorous plants are specialized on insect prey digestion to 
      obtain additional nutrients. Few species of the genus Nepenthes developed 
      mutualistic relationships with mammals for nitrogen supplementation. Whether dietary 
      changes require certain enzymatic composition to utilize new sources of nutrients 
      has rarely been tested. Here, we investigated the role of urease for Nepenthes 
      hemsleyana that gains nitrogen from the bat Kerivoula hardwickii while it roosts 
      inside the pitchers. We hypothesized that N. hemsleyana is able to use urea from the 
      bats' excrements. In fact, we demonstrate that (15)N-enriched urea provided to 
      Nepenthes pitchers is metabolized and its nitrogen is distributed within the plant. 
      As ureases are necessary to degrade urea, these hydrolytic enzymes should be 
      involved. We proved the presence and enzymatic activity of a urease for Nepenthes 
      plant tissues. The corresponding urease cDNA from N. hemsleyana was isolated and 
      functionally expressed. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for eukaryotic 
      ureases, including Nepenthes and five other carnivorous plants' taxa, identified 
      them as canonical ureases and reflects the plant phylogeny. Hence, this study 
      reveals ureases as an emblematic example for an efficient, low-cost but high 
      adaptive plasticity in plants while developing a further specialized lifestyle from 
      carnivory to coprophagy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowing the underlying mechanisms of mosquito ecology will ensure 
      effective vector management and contribute to the overall goal of malaria control. 
      Mosquito populations show a high degree of population plasticity in response to 
      environmental variability. However, the principle factors controlling population 
      size and fecundity are for the most part unknown. Larval habitat and diet play a 
      crucial role in subsequent mosquito fitness. Developing the most competitive insects 
      for sterile insect technique programmes requires a "production" orientated 
      perspective, to deduce the most effective larval diet formulation; the information 
      gained from this process offers us some insight into the mechanisms and processes 
      taking place in natural native mosquito habitats. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Fatty acid profiles and de-novo or direct assimilation pathways, of whole-individual 
      mosquitoes reared on a range of larval diets were determined using pyrolysis gas 
      chromatograph/mass spectrometry. We used elemental analysis and isotope ratio mass 
      spectrometry to measure individual-whole-body carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous 
      values and to assess the impact of dietary quality on subsequent population 
      stoichiometry, size, quality and isotopic signature. Diet had the greatest impact on 
      fatty acid (FA) profiles of the mosquitoes, which exhibited a high degree of dietary 
      routing, characteristic of generalist feeders. De-novo synthesis of a number of 
      important FAs was observed. Mosquito C:N stoichiometry was fixed in the teneral 
      stage. Dietary N content had significant influence on mosquito size, and P was shown 
      to be a flexible pool which limited overall population size. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Direct routing of FAs was evident but there was ubiquitous 
      de-novo synthesis suggesting mosquito larvae are competent generalist feeders 
      capable of survival on diet with varying characteristics. It was concluded that 
      nitrogen availability in the larval diet controlled teneral mosquito size and that 
      teneral CN ratio is a sex- and species-specific fixed parameter. This finding has 
      significant implications for overall mosquito competitiveness and environmental 
      management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human activities have profoundly altered the spatio-temporal 
      availability of food resources. Yet, there is a clear lack of knowledge on how 
      opportunistic species adapt to these new circumstances by scheduling their daily 
      rhythms and adjust their foraging decisions to predicable patterns of anthropic food 
      subsidies. Here, we used nearly continuous GPS tracking data to investigate the 
      adaptability of daily foraging activity in an opportunistic predator, the 
      yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), in response to human schedules. METHODS: By 
      using waveform analysis, we compared timing and magnitude of peaks in daily activity 
      of different GPS-tracked individuals in eleven different habitat types, in relation 
      to type of day (i.e., weekday vs. weekend). RESULTS: Daily activity rhythms varied 
      greatly depending on whether it was a weekday or weekend, thus suggesting that 
      gulls' activity peaks matched the routines of human activity in each habitat type. 
      We observed for the first time two types of activity as modelled by waveforms 
      analysis: marine habitats showed unimodal patterns with prolonged activity and 
      terrestrial habitats showed bimodal patterns with two shorter and variable activity 
      peaks. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gulls are able to fine-tune their daily 
      activity rhythms to habitat-specific human schedules, since these likely provide 
      feeding opportunities. Behavioral plasticity may thus be an important driver of 
      expansive population dynamics. Information on predictable relationships between 
      daily activity patterns of gulls and human activities is therefore relevant to their 
      population management.

TI  - Water relations of an insular pit viper.
LID - jeb204065 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.204065 [doi]
AB  - Colonization of novel habitats often requires plasticity or adaptation to local 
      conditions. There is a critical need to maintain hydration in terrestrial 
      environments having limited water. Atypical populations of Florida cottonmouth 
      snakes, Agkistrodon conanti, inhabit continental islands with no permanent sources 
      of fresh water. Here, we report investigations related to how these insular snakes 
      maintain water balance considering the mainland conspecifics are semi-aquatic and 
      typically associate with freshwater mesic habitats. We tested three hypotheses 
      related to water relations of insular populations of cottonmouth snakes compared 
      with those on the mainland. (1) Voluntary drinking of fresh water in free-ranging 
      insular snakes should reflect a relationship to recency of rainfall more strongly 
      than in mainland snakes. (2) Insular snakes will tolerate greater dehydration before 
      drinking than will mainland snakes. (3) Insular snakes will avoid drinking seawater 
      more strongly than will those from the mainland. Between 2001 and 2018, we 
      quantitatively estimated the hydration status of 337 individual cottonmouth snakes 
      from insular populations and 30 cottonmouth snakes from mainland Florida, as judged 
      by the tendency of wild-caught snakes to drink fresh water immediately following 
      capture. We found that insular cottonmouth snakes had a higher incidence of 
      dehydration than did mainland cottonmouth snakes (64% versus 23%), and the hydration 
      status of the insular snakes correlated with patterns of precipitation. We also 
      determined experimentally the dehydration threshold for drinking fresh water in 
      insular (mean±s.d. -5.64±4.3%, n=34) and mainland cottonmouth snakes (-5.74±4.5%, 
      n=21), and these were not significantly different. Discrimination tests for drinking 
      serially from a graded series of brackish water showed that mainland snakes did not 
      discriminate against the highest brackish value (10.5 ppt or 30% seawater), whereas 
      insular snakes showed a preference for <15% seawater. Naive neonates from insular 
      and mainland cohorts behaved similarly. The preference of insular snakes for fresh 
      water represents an important aspect of the maintenance of water balance that 
      differs from the mainland conspecifics and is likely a habituated or adaptive 
      response to dependence on rainfall.

TI  - Mouse hallucal metatarsal cross-sectional geometry in a simulated fine branch niche.
PG  - 759-65
LID - 10.1002/jmor.20376 [doi]
AB  - Mice raised in experimental habitats containing an artificial network of narrow 
      "arboreal" supports frequently use hallucal grasps during locomotion. Therefore, 
      mice in these experiments can be used to model a rudimentary form of arboreal 
      locomotion in an animal without other morphological specializations for using a fine 
      branch niche. This model would prove useful to better understand the origins of 
      arboreal behaviors in mammals like primates. In this study, we examined if 
      locomotion on these substrates influences the mid-diaphyseal cross-sectional 
      geometry of mouse metatarsals. Thirty CD-1/ICR mice were raised in either arboreal 
      (composed of elevated narrow branches of varying orientation) or terrestrial (flat 
      ramps and walkways that are stratified) habitats from weaning (21 days) to adulthood 
      (≥4 months). After experiments, the hallucal metatarsal (Mt1) and third metatarsal 
      (Mt3) for each individual were isolated and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) 
      scans were obtained to calculate mid-shaft cross-sectional area and polar section 
      modulus. Arboreal mice had Mt1s that were significantly more robust. Mt3 cross 
      sections were not significantly different between groups. The arboreal group also 
      exhibited a significantly greater Mt1/Mt3 ratio for both robusticity measures. We 
      conclude that the hallucal metatarsal exhibits significant phenotypic plasticity in 
      response to arboreal treatment due to habitual locomotion that uses a rudimentary 
      hallucal grasp. Our results support the hypothesis that early adaptive stages of 
      fine branch arboreality should be accompanied by a slightly more robust hallux 
      associated with the biomechanical demands of this niche.

TI  - PpeTAC1 promotes the horizontal growth of branches in peach trees and is a member of 
      a functionally conserved gene family found in diverse plants species.

AB  - Trees are capable of tremendous architectural plasticity, allowing them to maximize 
      their light exposure under highly competitive environments. One key component of 
      tree architecture is the branch angle, yet little is known about the molecular basis 
      for the spatial patterning of branches in trees. Here, we report the identification 
      of a candidate gene for the br mutation in Prunus persica (peach) associated with 
      vertically oriented growth of branches, referred to as 'pillar' or 'broomy'. 
      Ppa010082, annotated as hypothetical protein in the peach genome sequence, was 
      identified as a candidate gene for br using a next generation sequence-based mapping 
      approach. Sequence similarity searches identified rice TAC1 (tiller angle control 1) 
      as a putative ortholog, and we thus named it PpeTAC1. In monocots, TAC1 is known to 
      lead to less compact growth by increasing the tiller angle. In Arabidopsis, an 
      attac1 mutant showed more vertical branch growth angles, suggesting that the gene 
      functions universally to promote the horizontal growth of branches. TAC1 genes 
      belong to a gene family (here named IGT for a shared conserved motif) found in all 
      plant genomes, consisting of two clades: one containing TAC1-like genes; the other 
      containing LAZY1, which contains an EAR motif, and promotes vertical shoot growth in 
      Oryza sativa (rice) and Arabidopsis through influencing polar auxin transport. The 
      data suggest that IGT genes are ancient, and play conserved roles in determining 
      shoot growth angles in plants. Understanding how IGT genes modulate branch angles 
      will provide insights into how different architectural growth habits evolved in 
      terrestrial plants.

TI  - Effects of temperature and aquatic P(O2) on the physiology and behaviour of Apalone 
      ferox and Chrysemys picta.
PG  - 2185-95
AB  - Softshell turtles overwinter in the same bodies of water as some emydids, but their 
      reduced shell and increased non-pulmonary gas exchange may contribute to a different 
      mechanism of overwintering. The dynamics of bimodal respiration, diving behaviour 
      and blood acid-base status in Apalone ferox and Chrysemys picta were investigated 
      under two different temperatures combined with three different aquatic P(O2) levels. 
      Both species obtained oxygen through pulmonary and non-pulmonary routes. Apalone 
      ferox obtained more oxygen through non-pulmonary routes and increased its 
      non-pulmonary V(O2) in response to both higher aquatic P(O2) and lower temperatures. 
      Both species increased pulmonary V(O2) in response to higher temperatures. As a 
      consequence of the greater reliance of A. ferox on pulmonary V(O2), warmer 
      temperatures caused plasma P(CO2) and [HCO(3)(-1)] values to increase significantly 
      compared with C. picta. Apalone ferox, which is efficient at bimodal respiration, 
      displayed a high degree of plasticity with respect to both its respiratory and 
      acid-base profiles, behaving more like an aquatic air-breathing fish in bimodal 
      respiration at low temperature and more like a terrestrial air-breather at high 
      temperature. Chrysemys picta, which is poor at bimodal respiration, was highly 
      dependent on aerial gas exchange at both temperatures. Aquatic P(O2) did not change 
      any of the behavioural variables measured. At warm temperatures, A. ferox met O(2) 
      demands by increasing the rate of lung ventilation, which resulted in a 
      significantly greater number of breathing bouts per hour and breaths per emersion 
      period. However, the number of breaths per bout was not affected by temperature. As 
      temperatures decreased, A. ferox utilized its non-pulmonary respiration ability and 
      significantly increased its dive duration. Apalone ferox became less active at 
      colder temperatures by significantly increasing the duration of inactive periods 
      (from 4 to 18 min) and by significantly decreasing the frequency of activity bursts. 
      Chrysemys picta also met the higher gas-exchange demands associated with increased 
      temperature by increasing the rate of lung ventilation; however, this increase was 
      not as large as that measured in A. ferox. Chrysemys picta displayed multiple 
      rhythmic breaths per bout. These results indicate that, unlike aquatic P(O2), 
      temperature is an important factor in the regulation of diving and ventilatory 
      behaviour in turtles. The species responded to temperature in dissimilar ways 
      because of differences in their bimodal respiration ability.

TI  - Foraging across a variable landscape: behavioral decisions made by woodland caribou 
      at multiple spatial scales.
PG  - 590-602
LID - 10.1007/s004420000573 [doi]
AB  - We examined the foraging behavior of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) 
      relative to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of their environment. We assessed 
      (1) whether caribou altered their behavior over time while making trade-offs between 
      forage abundance and accessibility; and (2) whether foraging decisions were 
      consistent across spatial scales (i.e., as scale increased, similar decision 
      criteria were used at each scale). We discuss whether caribou adjusted their 
      behavior to take advantage of changing forage availability through time and space. 
      At the scale of the feeding site (as revealed by discriminant function analyses), 
      caribou in both forested and alpine (above tree-line) environments selected sites 
      where the biomass of particular lichen species was greatest and snow the least deep. 
      Caribou did not select those species with the highest nutritional value (i.e., 
      digestible protein and energy) in either area. Where snow depth, density, and 
      hardness limited access to terrestrial lichens in the forest, caribou foraged 
      instead at those trees with the greatest amount of arboreal lichen. Selection of 
      lichen species and the influence of snow differed across time, indicating that in 
      this system the abundance or accessibility of forage temporally influenced foraging 
      behavior. A path analysis of forest data and multiple regression analysis of alpine 
      data were used to test the hypothesis that variables important at the scale of the 
      feeding site explained foraging effort at the scale of the patch. For forest 
      patches, our hypothesized model reliably explained foraging effort, but not all 
      variables that were statistically important at the scale of the feeding site were 
      significant predictors at the scale of the patch. For alpine patches, our 
      hypothesized model did not explain a statistically significant portion of the 
      variation in the number of feeding sites within the patch, and none of the 
      individual variables from the feeding site remained statistically significant at the 
      patch scale. The incongruity between those variables important at the scale of the 
      feeding site and those important at the patch showed that spatial scale affects the 
      foraging decisions of woodland caribou. At the scale of the landscape, there was a 
      trade-off between forage abundance and accessibility. Relative to the alpine 
      environment, caribou in the forest foraged at feeding sites and patches with greater 
      amounts of less variably distributed lichen, but deeper less variable snow depths. 
      Considering the behavioral plasticity of woodland caribou, there may be no distinct 
      advantage to foraging in one landscape over the other.

TI  - Unique features of the skin barrier in naked mole rats reflect adaptations to their 
      fossorial habitat.
PG  - 1871-1880
LID - 10.1002/jmor.21072 [doi]
AB  - The stratum corneum (SC), the top layer of the epidermis, is the functional site of 
      the skin barrier and serves to maintain hydration of the body by preventing water 
      loss and thwarting the entrance of pathogens. The naked mole rat (NMR) 
      (Heterocephalus glaber) is a rodent that resides in hypoxic underground tunnels in 
      arid Africa. NMRs are not only hairless; their skin is devoid of glands and pain 
      sensation. To understand how the skin barrier of the NMR is uniquely adapted to this 
      environment, skin samples from the dorsum and ventral abdomen in one adult and one 
      neonate were examined by transmission electron microscopy using both reduced osmium 
      tetroxide to assess overall structure and ruthenium tetroxide post-fixation to 
      assess lipid organization. These findings were compared with that of hairless mice-a 
      well-defined model for skin barrier studies. The plasticity of the skin was 
      evaluated on 10 NMRs from a colony at the Philadelphia Zoo in humid and dry 
      conditions by measuring cutaneous hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and 
      pH. The epidermal ultrastructure of the NMR differed from hairless mice by having 
      the following features: decreased content of lamellar bodies (LBs), higher LB 
      pleomorphism, periodic presence of abnormal lipid bilayers, and an unusually thick 
      SC. The NMRs developed significant TEWL and a trend toward decreased hydration when 
      subjected to dry conditions. While these features illustrate an imperfect skin 
      barrier in terrestrial mammals, they likely represent adaptations of the 
      poikilothermic NMRs to their unique natural fossorial climate. Prolonged exposure to 
      decreased humidity could possibly lead to adverse health effects in this species.

TI  - Evaluation of Wastewater Treatment by Microcosms of Vertical Subsurface Wetlands in 
      Partially Saturated Conditions Planted with Ornamental Plants and Filled with 
      Mineral and Plastic Substrates.

AB  - The current knowledge about the role terrestrial ornamental plants play in 
      constructed wetlands (CWs) has scarcely been evaluated. Likewise, little attention 
      has been given towards the use of new support or fill media for subsurface flow CWs, 
      which may result in the reduction of costs when implemented on a large scale. This 
      study evaluated, during nine months, the effect of three terrestrial ornamental 
      plants and two substrates on the elimination of pollutants in wastewaters by using 
      fill-and-drain vertical subsurface flow CWs (FD-CWs). Sixteen microcosms were used, 
      nine filled with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and nine with porous river stone 
      (PRS). For each type of substrate, duplicates of microcosms were used, utilizing 
      Anthurium sp., Zantedeschia aethiopica, and Spathiphyllum wallisii as vegetation and 
      two other CWs without vegetation as controls. The environmental conditions, number 
      of flowers, and height of the plants were registered. The results revealed that both 
      substrates in the FD-CWs were efficient in removing pollutants. The average removal 
      of pollutants in systems with vegetation revealed a positive effect on the reduction 
      of the biochemical oxygen demand (55⁻70%), nitrates (28⁻44%), phosphates (25⁻45%), 
      and fecal coliforms (52⁻65%). Meanwhile, in units without vegetation, the reduction 
      of pollutants was nearly 40⁻50% less than in those with vegetation. The use of PET 
      as a filling substrate in CWs did not affect the growth and/or the flowering of the 
      species; therefore, its use combined with the species studied in CWs may be 
      replicated in villages with similar wastewater problems. This may represent a 
      reduction in implementation costs when utilizing PET recycled wastes and PRS as 
      substrates in these systems in comparison with the typical substrates used in CWs. 
      More studies are needed to better understand the interactions among these novel 
      support media and the commercial terrestrial ornamental plants.

AB  - The source, distribution, migration, and fate of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic and 
      terrestrial ecosystems have received much attention. However, the relevant reports 
      in wetland ecosystems, the boundary area between water and land, are still rare. 
      Where are the sources and sinks of MPs in the wetland? The latest researches have 
      shown that the sources of MPs in wetlands include sewage discharge, surface runoff, 
      and plastic wastes from aquaculture. Fibers and fragments are the most common 
      shapes, and PE, PP, PS can be detected in water or sediment matrices, and biota of 
      wetlands. The distribution is affected by hydrodynamic conditions, sediment 
      properties, and vegetation coverage. Factors affecting the vertical migration of MPs 
      include their own physical and chemical properties, the combination of substances 
      that accelerate deposition (mineral adsorption and biological flocculation), and 
      resuspension. Minerals tend to adsorb negatively charged MPs while algae aggregates 
      have a preference for positively charged MPs. The wetlands vegetation can trap MPs 
      and affect their migration. In water matrices, MPs are ingested by organisms and 
      integrated into sediments, which makes them seem undetectable in the wetland 
      ecosystem. Photodegradation and microbial degradation can further reduce the MPs in 
      size. Although recent research has increased, we are still searching for a 
      methodological harmonization of the detection practices and exploring the migration 
      rules and fate patterns of MPs. Our work is the first comprehensive review of the 
      source, distribution, migration, and fate of MPs in wetland ecosystems. It reveals 
      the uniqueness of wetland habitat in the research of MPs and indicates the potential 
      of wetlands acting as sources or sinks for MPs.

AB  - Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a plant-based chemical building block that could 
      potentially substitute petroleum-based equivalents, yet ecotoxicological data of 
      this compound is currently limited. In this study, the effects of HMF on the 
      reproduction and survival of Daphnia magna were assessed through validated 
      ecotoxicological tests. The mechanism of toxicity was determined by analysis of 
      transcriptomic responses induced by exposure to different concentrations of HMF 
      using RNA sequencing. HMF exerted toxicity to D. magna with an EC(50) for effects on 
      reproduction of 17.2 mg/l. HMF exposure affected molecular pathways including sugar 
      and polysaccharide metabolism, lipid metabolism, general stress metabolism and red 
      blood cell metabolism, although most molecular pathways affected by HMF exposure 
      were dose specific. Hemoglobin genes, however, responded in a sensitive and 
      dose-related manner. No induction of genes involved in the xenobiotic metabolism or 
      oxidative stress metabolism pathway could be observed, which contrasted earlier 
      observations on transcriptional responses of the terrestrial model Folsomia candida 
      exposed to the same compound in a similar dose. We found 4189 orthologue genes 
      between D. magna and F. candida, yet only twenty-one genes of those orthologues were 
      co-regulated in both species. The contrasting transcriptional responses to the same 
      compound exposed at a similar dose between D. magna and F. candida indicates limited 
      overlap in stress responses among soil and aquatic invertebrates. The dose-related 
      expression of hemoglobin provides further support for using hemoglobin expression as 
      a biomarker for general stress responses in daphnids.

      in rainwater in Yangtze River Delta].
PG  - 2035-41
AB  - By using a customized manual rainwater sampler made of polyvinyl chloride plastic, 
      the molar ratio of NH4(+) -N/NO3(-) -N and the natural 15N abundance of NH4(+) 
      (delta 15 NH4(+) in rainwater was monitored all year round from June 2003 to July 
      2005 at three observation sites (Changshu, Nanjing, and Hangzhou) in the Yangtze 
      River Delta. The results indicated that at the three sites, the NH4(+) -N/NO3(-) -N 
      ratio and the delta 15 NH4(+) value in rainwater had the similar seasonal variation 
      trend, being more obvious in Changshu (rural monitoring type) site than in Nanjing 
      (urban monitoring type) and Hangzhou (urban-rural monitoring type) sites. The NH4(+) 
      -N/NO3(-) -N ratio peaked from early June to early August, declined gradually 
      afterwards, and reached the bottom in winter; while the delta 15 NH4(+) value was 
      negative from late June to mid-August, turned positive from late August to mid or 
      late November, became negative again when winter dominated from December to March, 
      but turned positive again in next May and negative again in next July. These 
      seasonal variation patterns of NH4(+) -N/NO3(-) -N ratio and delta 15 NH4(+) value 
      were found in relation to the application of chemical nitrogen fertilizers during 
      different crop growth periods, and also, the alternation of seasons and the NH3 
      volatilization from other NH3 emission sources (including excrements of human and 
      animals, nitrogen- polluted water bodies, and organic nitrogen sources, etc.), which 
      could be taken as an indicator of defining the sources and form composition of 
      NH4(+) in atmospheric wet deposition and the intensity of various terrestrial NH3 
      emission sources.

      dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in soil and combusted residue at Guiyu, an 
      electronic waste recycling site in southeast China.
PG  - 2730-7
AB  - Surface soils and combusted residue from a village located in southeast China, which 
      has been intensely involved in the dismantling and "recycling" of computer parts 
      (e-waste) for the past decade, were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers 
      (PBDEs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Total 
      PBDE concentrations were highest in combusted residue of plastic chips and cables 
      collected from a residential area (33,000-97,400 ng/g, dry wt), in soils from an 
      acid leaching site (2720-4250 ng/g, dry wt), and a printer roller dump site 
      (593-2890 ng/g, dry wt). BDE-209 was the most dominant congener (35-82%) among the 
      study sites indicating the prevalence of commercial Deca-BDE, however signature 
      congeners from commercial Penta- and Octa-BDE were also found. PCDD/F concentrations 
      were also highest in soil from the acid leaching site (12,500-89,800 pg/g, 203-1100 
      pg WHO-TEQ/g, dry wt) and in combusted residue (13,500-25,300 pg/g, 84.3-174 pg 
      WHO-TEQ/g, dry wt) and were comparable to PCDD/F levels of some open dumping sites 
      in Asian developing countries. Of the e-waste activities, acid leaching and open 
      burning emitted the highest concentrations of PBDEs and PCDD/Fs. This study is among 
      the very few studies dealing with the important issue of pollution generated from 
      crude e-waste recycling. Our results showthatthe crude processing of e-waste has 
      become one of the major contributors of PBDEs and PCDD/Fs to the terrestrial 
      environment.

AB  - Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are ubiquitous in aquatic and terrestrial 
      environments, and detrimental biological effects have been observed on a variety of 
      organisms, from bacteria and alga to plants and animals. A fast-growing number of 
      toxicological studies report diverse responses and wide species-dependent 
      sensitivity upon MNP exposure. While studies are dominated by in vivo animal tests, 
      our understanding of cellular toxicity and the corresponding toxicity mechanisms is 
      still limited. This challenges the proper assessment of environmental hazards and 
      health risks of MNPs. In this review, we gathered and analyzed the up-to-date 
      studies on humans, animals, plants, alga, and bacteria, and identified the 
      similarities and differences in key toxicity mechanisms of MNPs across different 
      taxonomic groups. Particularly, human cell-based studies at the cellular level 
      provide fundamental and valuable information on the key toxicity mechanisms, which 
      are essential to answer the question of whether and how MNPs pose health threats. In 
      general, toxicity mechanisms of MNPs depend on their size, surface characteristics, 
      polymer type, as well as cell type. Plausible toxicity mechanisms mainly include 
      membrane disruption, extracellular polymeric substance disruption, reactive oxygen 
      species generation, DNA damage, cell pore blockage, lysosome destabilization, and 
      mitochondrial depolarization. A deeper understanding of these key mechanisms in 
      different taxonomic groups can also improve both in vivo and in vitro models useful 
      for predictive impact assessments of plastic pollution on the environment and human 
      health.

      CAR.
PG  - 14-26
LID - 10.1210/me.2011-1235 [doi]
AB  - The xenosensing constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is widely considered to have 
      arisen in early mammals via duplication of the pregnane X receptor (PXR). We report 
      that CAR emerged together with PXR and the vitamin D receptor from an ancestral NR1I 
      gene already in early vertebrates, as a result of whole-genome duplications. CAR 
      genes were subsequently lost from the fish lineage, but they are conserved in all 
      taxa of land vertebrates. This contrasts with PXR, which is found in most fish 
      species, whereas it is lost from Sauropsida (reptiles and birds) and plays a role 
      unrelated to xenosensing in Xenopus. This role is fulfilled in Xenopus by CAR, which 
      exhibits low basal activity and pronounced responsiveness to activators such as 
      drugs and steroids, altogether resembling mammalian PXR. The constitutive activity 
      typical for mammalian CAR emerged first in Sauropsida, and it is thus common to all 
      fully terrestrial land vertebrates (Amniota). The constitutive activity can be 
      achieved by humanizing just two amino acids of the Xenopus CAR. Taken together, our 
      results provide a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the 
      NR1I subfamily of nuclear receptors. They identify CAR as the more conserved and 
      remarkably plastic NR1I xenosensor in land vertebrates. Nonmammalian CAR should help 
      to dissect the specific functions of PXR and CAR in the metabolism of xeno- and 
      endobiotics in humans. Xenopus CAR is a first reported amphibian xenosensor, which 
      opens the way to toxicogenomic and bioaugmentation studies in this critically 
      endangered taxon of land vertebrates.

      and elemental content of the rootless terrestrial bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii, 
      which obtains its moisture, and likely its nutrients, from coastal fogs in the 
      Atacama Desert. We assessed (1) how fog nutrient supply influences plant growth and 
      stoichiometry and (2) the response of plant growth and stoichiometry to variations 
      in nutrient supply by using reciprocal transplants. We hypothesized that T. 
      landbeckii should exhibit physiological and biochemical plastic responses 
      commensurate with nutrient supply from atmospheric deposition. In the case of the 
      Atacama Desert, nutrient supply from fog is variable over space and time, which 
      suggests a relatively high variation in the growth and elemental content of 
      atmospheric bromeliads. We found that the nutrient content of T. landbeckii showed 
      high spatio-temporal variability, driven partially by fog nutrient deposition but 
      also by plant growth rates. Reciprocal transplant experiments showed that 
      transplanted individuals converged to similar nutrient content, growth rates, and 
      leaf production of resident plants at each site, reflecting local nutrient 
      availability. Although plant nutrient content did not exactly match the relative 
      supply of N and P, our results suggest that atmospheric nutrient supply is a 
      dominant driver of plant growth and stoichiometry. In fact, our results indicate 
      that N uptake by T. landbeckii plants depends more on N supplied by fog, whereas P 
      uptake is mainly regulated by within-plant nutrient demand for growth. Overall, 
      these findings indicate that variation in fog nutrient supply exerts a strong 
      control over growth and nutrient dynamics of atmospheric plants, which are 
      ubiquitous across fog-dominated ecosystems.

TI  - Maturation trends in red deer females over 39 years in harvested populations.
PG  - 595-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01514.x [doi]
AB  - 1. There is increasing awareness that heavy harvesting can lead to rapid evolution 
      towards earlier sexual maturation. With increased harvest pressure, individuals that 
      begin reproduction at light weights have a greater chance of reproducing at least 
      once compared with individuals that begin reproduction at heavier weights and hence 
      later in life. Although well documented in fish, this has not been empirically 
      tested for harvested populations of mammals in terrestrial ecosystems differing in 
      many environmental aspects. 2. Using data from 3856 female red deer (Cervus elaphus 
      L.) from three harvested populations, we tested whether red deer maturity changed 
      from 1967 to 2006. In these populations, density has increased markedly over the 
      time period reducing body mass of deer, which has decreased the proportion of 
      females maturing as yearlings. We therefore assessed trends in maturation as 
      yearlings after controlling for body mass. Long-lived iteroparous ungulate females 
      are expected to have a prudent life history not risking their future survival and 
      reproduction under harsh conditions (e.g. at high density). An alternative to the 
      harvest-induced evolution hypothesis is that maturation is driven mainly by 
      phenotypic responses to increased density, and we predicted later maturation even 
      after controlling for the reduction in body mass. 3. There was a marked trend 
      towards later age at maturation in one out of three populations (after controlling 
      for the effect of reduced body mass due to increased density), while there was no 
      marked trend in the two other populations. The harvesting-induced evolution 
      hypothesis was therefore not supported. However, although the decline was predicted 
      from the prudent life-history tactic hypothesis, the estimate for the density effect 
      was positive rather than negative after accounting for the year trend. Although we 
      did not find support for the harvest-induced earlier maturation hypothesis, evidence 
      was not clearly in favour of the alternative hypothesis. 4. Our study contrasts 
      results from trophy-hunting traditions targeting large males, and points to a 
      potential role of the cultural tradition. Harvesting in Scandinavia mainly aims for 
      meat targeting calves and yearlings (and males), which is less likely to yield an 
      evolutionary response in maturation of females. Our results, although being on a 
      plastic trait and not directly on genetic make-up, are indicative that 
      harvesting-induced evolution is weak on age at maturation in these populations under 
      the current management regime.

TI  - Long Term Exposure to Virgin and Recycled LDPE Microplastics Induced Minor Effects 
      in the Freshwater and Terrestrial Crustaceans Daphnia magna and Porcellio scaber.
LID - 10.3390/polym13050771 [doi]
LID - 771
AB  - The effects of microplastics (MP) are extensively studied, yet hazard data from 
      long-term exposure studies are scarce. Moreover, for sustainable circular use in the 
      future, knowledge on the biological impact of recycled plastics is essential. The 
      aim of this study was to provide long-term toxicity data of virgin vs recycled 
      (mechanical recycling) low density polyethylene (LDPE) for two commonly used 
      ecotoxicity models, the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and the terrestrial 
      crustacean Porcellio scaber. LDPE MP was tested as fragments of 39.8 ± 8.82 µm 
      (virgin) and 205 ± 144 µm (recycled) at chronic exposure levels of 1-100 mg LDPE/L 
      (D. magna) and 0.2-15 g LDPE/kg soil (P. scaber). Mortality, reproduction, body 
      length, total lipid content, feeding and immune response were evaluated. With the 
      exception of very low inconsistent offspring mortality at 10 mg/L and 100 mg/L of 
      recycled LDPE, no MP exposure-related adverse effects were recorded for D. magna. 
      For P. scaber, increased feeding on non-contaminated leaves was observed for virgin 
      LDPE at 5 g/kg and 15 g/kg. In addition, both LDPE induced a slight immune response 
      at 5 g/kg and 15 g/kg with more parameters altered for virgin LDPE. Our results 
      indicated different sublethal responses upon exposure to recycled compared to virgin 
      LDPE MP.

TI  - Ontogenetic plasticity in cranial morphology is associated with a change in the food 
      processing behavior in Alpine newts.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1186/s12983-020-00373-x [doi]
LID - 34
AB  - BACKGROUND: The feeding apparatus of salamanders consists mainly of the cranium, 
      mandible, teeth, hyobranchial apparatus and the muscles of the cranial region. The 
      morphology of the feeding apparatus in turn determines the boundary conditions for 
      possible food processing (i.e., intraoral mechanical reduction) mechanisms. However, 
      the morphology of the feeding apparatus changes substantially during metamorphosis, 
      prompting the hypothesis that larvae might use a different food processing mechanism 
      than post-metamorphic adults. Salamandrid newts with facultative metamorphosis are 
      suitable for testing this hypothesis as adults with divergent feeding apparatus 
      morphologies often coexist in the same population, share similar body sizes, and 
      feed on overlapping prey spectra. METHODS: We use high-speed videography to quantify 
      the in vivo movements of key anatomical elements during food processing in 
      paedomorphic and metamorphic Alpine newts (Ichthyosaura alpestris). Additionally, we 
      use micro-computed tomography (μCT) to analyze morphological differences in the 
      feeding apparatus of paedomorphic and metamorphic Alpine newts and sort them into 
      late-larval, mid-metamorphic and post-metamorphic morphotypes. RESULTS: Late-larval, 
      mid-metamorphic and post-metamorphic individuals exhibited clear morphological 
      differences in their feeding apparatus. Regardless of the paedomorphic state being 
      externally evident, paedomorphic specimens can conceal different morphotypes (i.e., 
      late-larval and mid-metamorphic morphotypes). Though feeding on the same prey under 
      the same (aquatic) condition, food processing kinematics differed between 
      late-larval, mid-metamorphic and post-metamorphic morphotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The food 
      processing mechanism in the Alpine newt changes along with morphology of the feeding 
      apparatus during ontogeny, from a mandible-based to a tongue-based processing 
      mechanism as the changing morphology of the mandible prevents chewing and the tongue 
      allows enhanced protraction. These results could indicate that early tetrapods, in 
      analogy to salamanders, may have developed new feeding mechanisms in their aquatic 
      environment and that these functional innovations may have later paved the way for 
      terrestrial feeding mechanisms.

AB  - On the latest 60 years the degradation and fragmentation of native habitats have 
      been modifying the landscape in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. The adaptive 
      plasticity of an organism has been crucial for its long-term survival and success in 
      these novel ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the response of four 
      endangered species of large terrestrial mammals to the variations in the quality of 
      their original habitats, in a context of high anthropogenic pressure. The 
      distribution of the Myrmecophaga tridactyla (Giant anteater), Priodontes maximus 
      (Giant armadillo), Tapirus terrestris (Lowland tapir) and Tayassu pecari 
      (White-lipped peccary) in all sampled habitats suggests their tolerance to 
      degradation. However, the survival ability of each species in the different habitats 
      was not the same. Among the four species, T. pecari seems to be the one with the 
      least ability to survive in more altered environments. The positive influence of the 
      anthropogenically altered habitats on abundances of three of the four species 
      studied, as observed at the regeneration areas, can be considered as a potential 
      indication of the ecological trap phenomenon. This study reinforces the importance 
      of the forest remnants for the survival of endangered mammal species, in regions of 
      high anthropogenic pressure, as in the eastern Brazilian Amazon.

AB  - As a characteristic sessile inhabitant of the intertidal zone, the Pacific oyster 
      Crassostrea gigas occupies one of the most physically stressful environments on 
      earth. With high exposure to terrestrial conditions, oysters must tolerate broad 
      fluctuations in temperature range. However, oysters' cellular and molecular 
      responses to temperature stresses have not been fully characterized. Here, we 
      analyzed oyster transcriptome data under high and low temperatures. We also 
      identified over 30 key temperature stress-responsive candidate genes, which encoded 
      stress proteins such as heat shock proteins and apoptosis-associated proteins. The 
      expression characterization of these genes under short-term cold and hot 
      environments (5 and 35 °C) and long-term cold environments (5 °C) was detected by 
      quantitative real-time PCR. Most of these genes reached expression peaks during the 
      recovery stage after 24 h of heat stress, and these genes were greatly induced 
      around day 3 in long-term cold stress while responded little to short-term cold 
      stress. In addition, in the second heat stress after 2 days of recovery, oysters 
      showed milder expression in these genes and a lower mortality rate, which indicated 
      the existence of plasticity in the oyster's response to heat stress. We confirmed 
      that homeostatic flexibility and anti-apoptosis might be crucial centers of 
      temperature stress responses in oysters. Furthermore, we analyzed stress gene 
      families in 11 different species and found that the linage-specific expansion of 
      stress genes might be implicated in adaptive evolution. These results indicated that 
      both plasticity and evolution played an important role in the stress response 
      adaptation of oysters.

TI  - Long-distance migrants vary migratory behaviour as much as short-distance migrants: 
      An individual-level comparison from a seabird species with diverse migration 
      strategies.
PG  - 1058-1070
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13431 [doi]
AB  - As environmental conditions fluctuate across years, seasonal migrants must determine 
      where and when to move without comprehensive knowledge of conditions beyond their 
      current location. Animals can address this challenge by following cues in their 
      local environment to vary behaviour in response to current conditions, or by moving 
      based on learned or inherited experience of past conditions resulting in fixed 
      behaviour across years. It is often claimed that long-distance migrants are more 
      fixed in their migratory behaviour because as distance between breeding and 
      wintering areas increases, reliability of cues to predict distant and future 
      conditions decreases. While supported by some population-level studies, the 
      influence of migration distance on behavioural variation is seldom examined on an 
      individual level. Lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus are generalist seabirds 
      that use a diversity of migration strategies. Using high-resolution multi-year GPS 
      tracking data from 82 individuals from eight colonies in Western Europe, we 
      quantified inter- and intra-individual variation in non-breeding distributions, 
      winter site fidelity, migration routes and timing of migration, with the objectives 
      of determining how much variation lesser black-backed gulls have in their migratory 
      behaviour and examining whether variation changes with migration distance. We found 
      that intra-individual variation was significantly lower than variation between 
      individuals for non-breeding distributions, winter site fidelity, migration routes 
      and timing of migration, resulting in consistent individual strategies for all 
      behaviours examined. Yet, intra-individual variation ranged widely among individuals 
      (e.g. winter site overlap: 0-0.91 out of 1; migration timing: 0-192 days), and 
      importantly, individual differences in variation were not related to migration 
      distance. The apparent preference for maintaining a consistent strategy, present in 
      even the shortest distance migrants, suggests that familiarity may be more 
      advantageous than exactly tracking current environmental conditions. Yet, variation 
      in behaviour across years was observed in many individuals and could be substantial. 
      This suggests that individuals, irrespective of migration distance, have the 
      capacity to adjust to current conditions within the broad confines of their 
      individual strategies, and occasionally, even change their strategy.

AB  - Plastic pollution has become a global threat in the natural environment, and an 
      urgent remedial measure is needed to reduce the negative effects caused by plastic 
      pollutants. In the current study, the effects of pyrolysis temperature (500 °C, 700 
      °C, and 900 °C) and aging on the adsorption of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) onto 
      corncob biochar were systematically assessed with kinetic, isotherm, pH-dependent 
      adsorption experiments, FTIR and XPS spectroscopy, and DLVO calculations. The 
      oxidation was done with 5% of HNO(3)/H(2)SO(4) to simulate long-term oxidative aging 
      of biochar in the environment. The results showed that the specific surface area, 
      hydrophobicity, and aromaticity of biochar increased with pyrolysis temperature, 
      whereas the specific surface area and amounts of oxygen-containing groups increased 
      after oxidation. The adsorption mechanism of PSNPs onto the biochar was explored 
      based on the correlation between biochar properties and adsorption parameters 
      derived from adsorption isotherms. Overall, the adsorption capacity of biochar for 
      PSNPs increased with increased pyrolysis temperature and after aging. While the 
      increase of specific surface area was considered the major factor leading to the 
      increase of the adsorption, the variation in surface properties also played an 
      important role. Pore filling, hydrophobic interaction, and hydrogen bonding may all 
      be involved in PSNPs adsorption to biochar. However, the hydrophobic interaction 
      might be more important for the fresh biochar, whereas hydrogen bonding involving 
      oxygen-containing groups might make a bigger contribution to PSNPs adsorption to 
      oxidized biochar. The pH experiments revealed that PSNPs adsorption decreased in 
      general with the increase of pH, indicating that electrostatic repulsion played a 
      vital role in the PSNPs adsorption process. The results of this study indicate that 
      biochar can be potentially applied to immobilize plastic particles in terrestrial 
      ecosystems such as in soil or groundwater, and the immobilization could be enhanced 
      via artificial oxidation or aging of biochar in the natural environment.

AB  - Isopods are macrodecomposers in terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to soil organic 
      matter breakdown and nutrient cycling. They have been considered sensitive in 
      laboratory tests designed to evaluate contaminants effects and are considered likely 
      candidates to have a standardized protocol for ecotoxicity tests. For this purpose, 
      a reference substance should be proposed as positive control in laboratory tests. 
      This work aimed to evaluate the avoidance behaviour of the isopod species Porcellio 
      dilatatus to boric acid (H(3)BO(3); BA). Interlaboratory comparison tests were 
      carried out based on the ISO guideline for earthworms, using tropical artificial 
      soil as substrate, in the concentrations of 0, 125, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1300 and 
      1800 mg BA kg(-1) soil. Avoidance behaviour was evaluated in group (six organisms 
      per replicate) and in individual tests (one organism per replicate), in dual-section 
      plastic boxes, which received control soil (not contaminated) in one side and tested 
      soil (with BA) in another one. The percentage of organisms in each side was recorded 
      after 48 h, and data were analysed using Fisher exact test (p < 0.05) and t-test. 
      Results showed significant avoidance response in individual tests at 250 mg kg(-1) 
      and in group tests at 500 mg kg(-1). Limited habitat function (< 20% of organisms) 
      for both tests and laboratories were observed at the highest tested concentration of 
      1800 mg kg(-1), indicating the low sensitivity of this species to BA in avoidance 
      tests, if compared to other substances in literature. Results showed that BA can be 
      used as reference substance until a better option will be proposed.

      extensive research has been conducted in recent years on microplastic pollution in 
      river sediments, knowledge on the relationships between potential influential 
      factors such as catchment characteristics and sediment properties, and microplastics 
      occurrence in river sediments, is still considered an under-researched area. This 
      study evaluated the influence of land use, population, and sediment particle size on 
      the presence of microplastics abundance and types. Based on a Bayesian Network 
      modelling approach to characterise the correlations between influencing factors and 
      microplastics occurrence, it was evident that microplastics type had a positive 
      correlation with different land use types and population. Catchment characteristics 
      were found to play a more important role in influencing microplastics type than 
      microplastics concentration. A statistically significant positive relationship was 
      observed between microplastics concentration and clay particles which suggested that 
      the occurrence of microplastics in sediments can be impacted by the presence of clay 
      particles.

AB  - Convergent evolution in similar environments constitutes strong evidence of adaptive 
      evolution. Transported with people around the world, house mice colonized even 
      remote areas, such as Sub-Antarctic islands. There, they returned to a feral way of 
      life, shifting towards a diet enriched in terrestrial macroinvertebrates. Here, we 
      test the hypothesis that this triggered convergent evolution of the mandible, a 
      morphological character involved in food consumption. Mandible shape from four 
      Sub-Antarctic islands was compared to phylogeny, tracing the history of 
      colonization, and climatic conditions. Mandible shape was primarily influenced by 
      phylogenetic history, thus discarding the hypothesis of convergent evolution. The 
      biomechanical properties of the jaw were then investigated. Incisor in-lever and 
      temporalis out-lever suggested an increase in the velocity of incisor biting, in 
      agreement with observations on various carnivorous and insectivorous rodents. The 
      mechanical advantage related to incisor biting also revealed an increased functional 
      performance in Sub-Antarctic populations, and appears to be an adaptation to catch 
      prey more efficiently. The amount of change involved was larger than expected for a 
      plastic response, suggesting microevolutionary processes were evolved. This study 
      thus denotes some degree of adaptive convergent evolution related to changes in 
      habitat-related changes in dietary items in Sub-Antarctic mice, but only regarding 
      simple, functionally relevant aspects of mandible morphology.

TI  - Novel metabolic attributes of the genus cyanothece, comprising a group of 
      unicellular nitrogen-fixing Cyanothece.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00214-11 [doi]
LID - e00214-11
AB  - The genus Cyanothece comprises unicellular cyanobacteria that are morphologically 
      diverse and ecologically versatile. Studies over the last decade have established 
      members of this genus to be important components of the marine ecosystem, 
      contributing significantly to the nitrogen and carbon cycle. System-level studies of 
      Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, a prototypic member of this group, revealed many 
      interesting metabolic attributes. To identify the metabolic traits that define this 
      class of cyanobacteria, five additional Cyanothece strains were sequenced to 
      completion. The presence of a large, contiguous nitrogenase gene cluster and the 
      ability to carry out aerobic nitrogen fixation distinguish Cyanothece as a genus of 
      unicellular, aerobic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Cyanothece cells can create an 
      anoxic intracellular environment at night, allowing oxygen-sensitive processes to 
      take place in these oxygenic organisms. Large carbohydrate reserves accumulate in 
      the cells during the day, ensuring sufficient energy for the processes that require 
      the anoxic phase of the cells. Our study indicates that this genus maintains a 
      plastic genome, incorporating new metabolic capabilities while simultaneously 
      retaining archaic metabolic traits, a unique combination which provides the 
      flexibility to adapt to various ecological and environmental conditions. 
      Rearrangement of the nitrogenase cluster in Cyanothece sp. strain 7425 and the 
      concomitant loss of its aerobic nitrogen-fixing ability suggest that a similar 
      mechanism might have been at play in cyanobacterial strains that eventually lost 
      their nitrogen-fixing ability. IMPORTANCE: The unicellular cyanobacterial genus 
      Cyanothece has significant roles in the nitrogen cycle in aquatic and terrestrial 
      environments. Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 was extensively studied over the last decade 
      and has emerged as an important model photosynthetic microbe for bioenergy 
      production. To expand our understanding of the distinctive metabolic capabilities of 
      this cyanobacterial group, we analyzed the genome sequences of five additional 
      Cyanothece strains from different geographical habitats, exhibiting diverse 
      morphological and physiological attributes. These strains exhibit high rates of N(2) 
      fixation and H(2) production under aerobic conditions. They can generate copious 
      amounts of carbohydrates that are stored in large starch-like granules and 
      facilitate energy-intensive processes during the dark, anoxic phase of the cells. 
      The genomes of some Cyanothece strains are quite unique in that there are linear 
      elements in addition to a large circular chromosome. Our study provides novel 
      insights into the metabolism of this class of unicellular nitrogen-fixing 
      cyanobacteria.

AB  - Despite the global occurrence of microplastic contamination on sandy beaches, 
      evidence of microplastic distribution within beaches remains contradictory. When 
      conflicting evidence is used to inform sampling surveys, it increases uncertainty in 
      resulting data. Moreover, it hampers spatially explicit risk characterization of 
      microplastic pollution to intertidal fauna. We aimed to guide sampling designs for 
      microplastic monitoring on beaches, and to quantify macroinfauna exposure to 
      microplastics. Microplastic abundance, quantified between 5 mm-66 μm, lacked a 
      significant zonation across the top sediment layer of sub-terrestrial, upper and 
      lower midlittoral, and swash zones at two sites with varying anthropogenic influence 
      on a microtidal dissipative beach in Uruguay. Microplastic abundance decreased 
      exponentially with increasing grain size, as revealed by Bayesian Poisson 
      regression, although the decrease was less steep compared to prior knowledge 
      regarding sediment - plastic interactions obtained for large (millimeter-sized) 
      industrial pellets. Significant differences in microplastic contamination between 
      the two sites with varying anthropogenic influence likely related to their proximity 
      to a freshwater canal. Corresponding field measurements of body burdens of fibers 
      and irregular particles were significantly lower for the polychaete Euzonus 
      (Thoracophelia) furcifera, despite its preference for finer sediments with higher 
      microplastic loads, compared to the isopods Excirolana braziliensis and Excirolana 
      armata. Results provide critical insights toward representative sampling of 
      microplastics within beach sites. Specifically, we caution against sampling limited 
      to the drift line, and instead recommend: 1) reporting beach morphodynamic 
      characteristics; 2) using clearly defined, ecologically-informed zonation schemes; 
      and 3) accounting for sediment grain size as a covariate to normalize among reported 
      contamination levels. The results contribute valuable baseline data toward realistic 
      exposure landscapes relative to the sediment grain size preferences of macroinfauna, 
      needed to inform laboratory experiments.

TI  - Simulated climate change increases larval mortality, alters phenology, and affects 
      flight morphology of a dragonfly.
LID - e02151 [pii]
LID - 10.1002/ecs2.2151 [doi]
AB  - For organisms with complex life cycles, climate change can have both direct effects 
      and indirect effects that are mediated through plastic responses to temperature and 
      that carry over beyond the developmental environment. We examined multiple responses 
      to environmental warming in a dragonfly, a species whose life history bridges 
      aquatic and terrestrial environments. We tested larval survival under warming and 
      whether warmer conditions can create carry-over effects between life history stages. 
      Rearing dragonfly larvae in an experimental warming array to simulate increases in 
      temperature, we contrasted the effects of the current thermal environment with 
      temperatures +2.5°C and +5°C above ambient, temperatures predicted for 50 and 100 
      years in the future for the study region. Aquatic mesocosms were stocked with 
      dragonfly larvae (Erythemis collocata) and we followed survival of larvae to adult 
      emergence. We also measured the effects of warming on the timing of the life history 
      transition to the adult stage, body size of adults, and the relative size of their 
      wings, an aspect of morphology key to flight performance. There was a trend toward 
      reduced larval survival with increasing temperature. Warming strongly affected the 
      phenology of adult emergence, advancing emergence by up to a month compared with 
      ambient conditions. Additionally, our warmest conditions increased variation in the 
      timing of adult emergence compared with cooler conditions. The increased variation 
      with warming arose from an extended emergence season with fewer individuals emerging 
      at any one time. Altered emergence patterns such as we observed are likely to place 
      individuals emerging outside the typical season at greater risk from early and late 
      season storms and will reduce effective population sizes during the breeding season. 
      Contrary to expectations for ectotherms, body size was unaffected by warming. 
      However, morphology was affected: at +5°C, dragonflies emerging from mesocosms had 
      relatively smaller wings. This provides some of the first evidence that the effects 
      of climate change on animals during their growth can have carry-over effects in 
      morphology that will affect performance of later life history stages. In 
      dragonflies, relatively smaller wings are associated with reduced flight 
      performance, creating a link between larval thermal conditions and adult dispersal 
      capacity.

TI  - Getting into Shape: Limb Bone Strength in Perinatal Lemur catta and Propithecus 
      coquereli.

AB  - Functional studies of skeletal anatomy are predicated on the fundamental assumption 
      that form will follow function. For instance, previous studies have shown that the 
      femora of specialized leaping primates are more robust than those of more 
      generalized primate quadrupeds. Are such differences solely a plastic response to 
      differential loading patterns during postnatal life, or might they also reflect more 
      canalized developmental mechanisms present at birth? Here, we show that perinatal 
      Lemur catta, an arboreal/terrestrial quadruped, have less robust femora than 
      perinatal Propithecus coquereli, a closely related species specialized for vertical 
      clinging and leaping (a highly unusual locomotor mode in which the hindlimbs are 
      used to launch the animal between vertical tree trunks). These results suggest that 
      functional differences in long bone cross-sectional dimensions are manifest at 
      birth, belying simple interpretations of adult postcranial form as a direct record 
      of loading patterns during postnatal life. Despite these significant differences in 
      bone robusticity, we find that hindlimb bone mineralization, material properties, 
      and measures of whole-bone strength generally overlap in perinatal L. catta and P. 
      coquereli, indicating little differentiation in postcranial maturity at birth 
      despite known differences in the pace of craniodental development between the 
      species. In a broader perspective, our results likely reflect evolution acting 
      during prenatal ontogeny. Even though primates are notable for relatively prolonged 
      gestation and postnatal parental care, neonates are not buffered from selection, 
      perhaps especially in the unpredictable and volatile environment of Madagascar. Anat

AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including the mass-produced component of 
      plastics, bisphenol A (BPA) are widely prevalent in aquatic and terrestrial 
      habitats. Many aquatic species, such as fish, amphibians, aquatic reptiles and 
      mammals, are exposed daily to high concentrations of BPA and ethinyl estradiol 
      (EE2), estrogen in birth control pills. In this review, we will predominantly focus 
      on BPA and EE2, well-described estrogenic EDCs. First, the evidence that BPA and EE2 
      are detectable in almost all bodies of water will be discussed. We will consider how 
      BPA affects sexual and neural development in these species, as these effects have 
      been the best characterized across taxa. For instance, such chemicals have been in 
      many cases reported to cause sex-reversal of males to females. Even if these 
      chemicals do not overtly alter the gonadal sex, there are indications that several 
      EDCs might demasculinize male-specific behaviors that are essential for attracting a 
      mate. In so doing, these chemicals may reduce the likelihood that these males 
      reproduce. If exposed males do reproduce, the concern is that they will then be 
      passing on compromised genetic fitness to their offspring and transmitting potential 
      transgenerational effects through their sperm epigenome. We will thus consider how 
      diverse epigenetic changes might be a unifying mechanism of how BPA and EE2 disrupt 
      several processes across species. Such changes might also serve as universal species 
      diagnostic biomarkers of BPA and other EDCs exposure. Lastly, the evidence that 
      estrogenic EDCs-induced effects in aquatic species might translate to humans will be 
      considered.

AB  - The Alphaproteobacteria show a remarkable diversity of cell cycle-dependent 
      developmental patterns, which are governed by the conserved CtrA pathway. Its 
      central component CtrA is a DNA-binding response regulator that is controlled by a 
      complex two-component signaling network, mediating distinct transcriptional programs 
      in the two offspring. The CtrA pathway has been studied intensively and was shown to 
      consist of an upstream part that reads out the developmental state of the cell and a 
      downstream part that integrates the upstream signals and mediates CtrA 
      phosphorylation. However, the role of this circuitry in bacterial diversification 
      remains incompletely understood. We have therefore investigated CtrA regulation in 
      the morphologically complex stalked budding alphaproteobacterium Hyphomonas 
      neptunium. Compared to relatives dividing by binary fission, H. neptunium shows 
      distinct changes in the role and regulation of various pathway components. Most 
      notably, the response regulator DivK, which normally links the upstream and 
      downstream parts of the CtrA pathway, is dispensable, while downstream components 
      such as the pseudokinase DivL, the histidine kinase CckA, the phosphotransferase 
      ChpT and CtrA are essential. Moreover, CckA is compartmentalized to the nascent bud 
      without forming distinct polar complexes and CtrA is not regulated at the level of 
      protein abundance. We show that the downstream pathway controls critical functions 
      such as replication initiation, cell division and motility. Quantification of the 
      signal flow through different nodes of the regulatory cascade revealed that the CtrA 
      pathway is a leaky pipeline and must involve thus-far unidentified factors. 
      Collectively, the quantitative system-level analysis of CtrA regulation in H. 
      neptunium points to a considerable evolutionary plasticity of cell cycle regulation 
      in alphaproteobacteria and leads to hypotheses that may also hold in 
      well-established model organisms such as Caulobacter crescentus.

AB  - Daniel Arnon first proposed the notion of a 'grand design of photosynthesis' in 1982 
      to illustrate the central role of photosynthesis as the primary energy transformer 
      for all life on Earth. However, we suggest that this concept can be extended to the 
      broad impact of photosynthesis not only in global energy transformation but also in 
      the regulation of plant growth, development, survival and crop productivity through 
      chloroplast redox signalling. We compare and contrast the role of chloroplast redox 
      imbalance, measured as excitation pressure, in governing acclimation to abiotic 
      stress and phenotypic plasticity. Although all photoautrophs sense excessive 
      excitation energy through changes in excitation pressure, the response to this 
      chloroplast redox signal is species dependent. Due to a limited capacity to adjust 
      metabolic sinks, cyanobacteria and green algae induce photoprotective mechanisms 
      which dissipate excess excitation energy at a cost of decreased photosynthetic 
      performance. In contrast, terrestrial, cold tolerant plants such as wheat enhance 
      metabolic sink capacity which leads to enhanced photosynthetic performance and 
      biomass accumulation with minimal dependence on photoprotection. We suggest that the 
      family of nuclear C-repeat binding transcription factors (CBFs) associated with the 
      frost resistance locus, FR2, contiguous with the vernalization locus,VRN1, and 
      mapped to chromosome 5A of wheat, may be critical components that link leaf 
      chloroplast redox regulation to enhanced photosynthetic performance, the 
      accumulation of growth-active gibberellins and the dwarf phenotype during cold 
      acclimation prior to the vegetative to reproductive transition controlled by 
      vernalization in winter cereals. Further genetic, molecular and biochemical research 
      to confirm these links and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which chloroplast 
      redox modulation of CBF expression leads to enhanced photosynthetic performance is 
      required. Because of the superior abiotic stress tolerance of cold tolerant winter 
      wheat and seed yields that historically exceed those of spring wheat by 30-40%, we 
      discuss the potential to exploit winter cereals for the maintenance or perhaps even 
      the enhancement of cereal productivity under future climate change scenarios that 
      will be required to feed a growing human population.

TI  - Plant responses to soil heterogeneity and global environmental change.
PG  - 1303-1314
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that soil nutrient heterogeneity, a ubiquitous feature of 
      terrestrial ecosystems, modulates plant responses to ongoing global change (GC). 
      However, we know little about the overall trends of such responses, the GC drivers 
      involved, and the plant attributes affected.We synthesized literature to answer the 
      question: Does soil heterogeneity significantly affect plant responses to main GC 
      drivers, such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO(2)), nitrogen 
      (N) enrichment and changes in rainfall regime?Overall, most studies have addressed 
      short-term effects of N enrichment on the performance of model plant communities 
      using experiments conducted under controlled conditions. The role of soil 
      heterogeneity as a modulator of plant responses to elevated CO(2) may depend on the 
      plasticity in nutrient uptake patterns. Soil heterogeneity does interact with N 
      enrichment to determine plant growth and nutrient status, but the outcome of this 
      interaction has been found to be both synergistic and inhibitory. The very few 
      studies published on interactive effects of soil heterogeneity and changes in 
      rainfall regime prevented us from identifying any general pattern.We identify the 
      long-term consequences of soil heterogeneity on plant community dynamics in the 
      field, and the ecosystem level responses of the soil heterogeneity × GC driver 
      interaction, as the main knowledge gaps in this area of research.In order to fill 
      these gaps and take soil heterogeneity and GC research a step forward, we propose 
      the following research guidelines: 1) combining morphological and physiological 
      plant responses to soil heterogeneity with field observations of community 
      composition and predictions from simulation models; and 2) incorporating soil 
      heterogeneity into a trait-based response-effect framework, where plant resource-use 
      traits are used as both response variables to this heterogeneity and GC, and 
      predictors of ecosystem functioning.Synthesis. There is enough evidence to affirm 
      that soil heterogeneity modulates plant responses to elevated atmospheric CO(2) and 
      N enrichment. Our synthesis indicates that we must explicitly consider soil 
      heterogeneity to accurately predict plant responses to GC drivers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reptiles, characterized by both diversity and unique evolutionary 
      adaptations, provide a comprehensive system for comparative studies of metabolism, 
      physiology, and development. However, molecular resources for ectothermic reptiles 
      are severely limited, hampering our ability to study the genetic basis for many 
      evolutionarily important traits such as metabolic plasticity, extreme longevity, 
      limblessness, venom, and freeze tolerance. Here we use massively parallel sequencing 
      (454 GS-FLX Titanium) to generate a transcriptome of the western terrestrial garter 
      snake (Thamnophis elegans) with two goals in mind. First, we develop a molecular 
      resource for an ectothermic reptile; and second, we use these sex-specific 
      transcriptomes to identify differences in the presence of expressed transcripts and 
      potential genes of evolutionary interest. RESULTS: Using sex-specific pools of RNA 
      (one pool for females, one pool for males) representing 7 tissue types and 35 
      diverse individuals, we produced 1.24 million sequence reads, which averaged 366 bp 
      in length after cleaning. Assembly of the cleaned reads from both sexes with NEWBLER 
      and MIRA resulted in 96,379 contigs containing 87% of the cleaned reads. Over 34% of 
      these contigs and 13% of the singletons were annotated based on homology to 
      previously identified proteins. From these homology assignments, additional 
      clustering, and ORF predictions, we estimate that this transcriptome contains 
      ~13,000 unique genes that were previously identified in other species and over 
      66,000 transcripts from unidentified protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we use a 
      graph-clustering method to identify contigs linked by NEWBLER-split reads that 
      represent divergent alleles, gene duplications, and alternatively spliced 
      transcripts. Beyond gene identification, we identified 95,295 SNPs and 31,651 
      INDELs. From these sex-specific transcriptomes, we identified 190 genes that were 
      only present in the mRNA sequenced from one of the sexes (84 female-specific, 106 
      male-specific), and many highly variable genes of evolutionary interest. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale, multi-organ transcriptome for an 
      ectothermic reptile. This resource provides the most comprehensive set of EST 
      sequences available for an individual ectothermic reptile species, increasing the 
      number of snake ESTs 50-fold. We have identified genes that appear to be under 
      evolutionary selection and those that are sex-specific. This resource will assist 
      studies on gene expression and comparative genomics, and will facilitate the study 
      of evolutionarily important traits at the molecular level.

TI  - Global scaling the leaf nitrogen and phosphorus resorption of woody species: 
      Revisiting some commonly held views.

AB  - Leaf nutrient resorption is one of the important mechanisms for nutrient 
      conservation in plants. Element stoichiometry is crucial to characterizing nutrient 
      limitations and terrestrial ecosystem function. Here, we use nitrogen (N) and 
      phosphorus (P) resorption efficiencies (NRE and PRE) and their stoichiometry to 
      evaluate the response patterns of leaf nutrient resorption efficiency (NuRE) to 
      plant functional groups, species traits, climate, and soil nutrients on the global 
      scale. In light of the findings from the global data set of published literature on 
      N and P resorption by woody plants, we revisit the commonly held views that: The 
      strong N fixation ability of N-fixers weakened the NRE, which was consistent with 
      the general views. The NuRE was linearly negatively correlated with plant growth 
      rate. The higher NuRE of evergreen species than deciduous plants revealed how leaf 
      life span constrains nutrient conservation. From the perspective of NRE, PRE and 
      their ratios, woody plants were limited by P in the tropical zone and the limiting 
      nutrient gradually transformed into N in the temperate zone (23.43-66.57°). The NuRE 
      of woody plants in the frigid zone was the largest than that of others implied that 
      low temperature may limit the nutrient absorption by plant roots, thereby enhancing 
      the retranslocation of nutrients by senesced leaves. Furthermore, Akaike weights 
      analysis found that mean annual precipitation (MAP) and temperature (MAT), N-fixers, 
      soil nutrients, and leaf life span have significant effects on nutrient resorption 
      patterns, sequentially. Overall, these results showed that the plasticity of plant 
      nutrient resorption patterns was strongly sensitive to plant functional groups and 
      soil nutrients, but the regularity of NuRE on a global scale was controlled by 
      temperature and precipitation. And the resorption stoichiometry pattern better 
      interprets plant nutrient limitation and the synergy effect of N and P in plant and 
      soil on multiple scales.

AB  - The microstructure of leaf epidermis, the localization, and content of syringyl (S) 
      and guajacyl (G) monolignol in epidermal cells of Phragmites australis grown in 
      water and moderate drought soil on the bank of the Venetian strait of the Dnipro 
      River in Kiev (Ukraine) were studied with the electron microscopic method and laser 
      confocal microscopy. The trichomes, guard cells of stomata, epidermal cells of 
      vaulted zones over veins of adaxial and abaxial surface contained syringyl and 
      guajacyl, the content of which depended on plant ecotype. We established that 
      moisture soil influenced the leaf epidermis ultrastructure, on the change of 
      monolignols content and S/G ratio in epidermis leaf of reed. The investigations show 
      that trichomes and the cells of the vaulted zone in the leaf epidermis were the main 
      accumulator of monolignols. The obtained results suggest that change of the 
      microstructure of leaves, content of the monolignols, and S/G ratio in leaves 
      contribute to the preservation of optimal water status of plants and can be 
      considered as the signs of plant phenotypic plasticity and adaptive marker depending 
      on the conditions of water supply.

TI  - Potential Control of Potato Soft Rot Disease by the Obligate Predators Bdellovibrio 
      and Like Organisms.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02543-19 [doi]
LID - e02543-19
AB  - Bacterial soft rot diseases caused by Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya spp. affect a 
      wide range of crops, including potatoes, a major food crop. As of today, farmers 
      mostly rely on sanitary practices, water management, and plant nutrition for 
      control. We tested the bacterial predators Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) 
      to control potato soft rot. BALOs are small, motile predatory bacteria found in 
      terrestrial and aquatic environments. They prey on a wide range of Gram-negative 
      bacteria, including animal and plant pathogens. To this end, BALO strains HD100, 
      109J, and a ΔmerRNA derivative of HD100 were shown to efficiently prey on various 
      rot-causing strains of Pectobacterium and Dickeya solani BALO control of maceration 
      caused by a highly virulent strain of Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasilense 
      was then tested in situ using a potato slice assay. All BALO strains were highly 
      effective at reducing disease, up to complete prevention. Effectivity was 
      concentration dependent, and BALOs applied before P. carotovorum subsp. brasilense 
      inoculation performed significantly better than those applied after the 
      disease-causing agent, maybe due to in situ consumption of glucose by the prey, as 
      glucose metabolism by live prey bacteria was shown to prevent predation. Dead 
      predators and the supernatant of BALO cultures did not significantly prevent 
      maceration, indicating that predation was the major mechanism for the prevention of 
      the disease. Finally, plastic resistance to predation was affected by prey and 
      predator population parameters, suggesting that population dynamics affect prey 
      response to predation.IMPORTANCE Bacterial soft rot diseases caused by 
      Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya spp. are among the most important plant diseases 
      caused by bacteria. Among other crops, they inflict large-scale damage to potatoes. 
      As of today, farmers have few options to control them. The bacteria Bdellovibrio and 
      like organisms (BALOs) are obligate predators of bacteria. We tested their potential 
      to prey on Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya spp. and to protect potato. We show that 
      different BALOs can prey on soft rot-causing bacteria and prevent their growth in 
      situ, precluding tissue maceration. Dead predators and the supernatant of BALO 
      cultures did not significantly prevent maceration, showing that the effect is due to 
      predation. Soft rot control by the predators was concentration dependent and was 
      higher when the predator was inoculated ahead of the prey. As residual prey 
      remained, we investigated what determines their level and found that initial prey 
      and predator population parameters affect prey response to predation.

      brought about by transportation of Mars ejecta produced by meteoroid impacts on the 
      Martian surface, has been comprehensively assessed in a statistical approach, based 
      on the most probable history of recent major gigantic meteoroid collisions on the 
      Martian surface. This article is the first part of our study to assess potential 
      microbial density in Mars ejecta departing from the Martian atmosphere, as a source 
      of the second part (Kurosawa et al., 2019) where statistical analysis of microbial 
      contamination probability is conducted. Potential microbial density on the Martian 
      surface as the source of microorganisms was estimated by analogy to the terrestrial 
      areas having the similar arid and cold environments, from which a probabilistic 
      function was deduced as the asymptotic limit. Microbial survival rate during 
      hypervelocity meteoroid collisions was estimated by numerical analysis of impact 
      phenomena with and without taking internal friction and plastic deformation of the 
      colliding meteoroid and the target ground into consideration. Trajectory 
      calculations of departing ejecta through the Martian atmosphere were conducted with 
      taking account of aerodynamic deceleration and heating by the aid of computational 
      fluid dynamic analysis. It is found that Mars ejecta smaller than 0.03 m in diameter 
      hardly reach the Phobos orbit due to aerodynamic deceleration, or mostly sterilized 
      due to significant aerodynamic heating even though they can reach the Phobos orbit 
      and beyond. Finally, the baseline dataset of microbial density in Mars ejecta 
      departing for Martian moons has been presented for the second part of our study.

TI  - Acclimation effects on thermal tolerances of springtails from sub-Antarctic Marion 
      Island: indigenous and invasive species.
PG  - 113-25
AB  - Collembola are abundant and functionally significant arthropods in sub-Antarctic 
      terrestrial ecosystems, and their importance has increased as a consequence of the 
      many invasive alien species that have been introduced to the region. It has also 
      been predicted that current and future climate change will favour alien over 
      indigenous species as a consequence of more favourable responses to warming in the 
      former. It is therefore surprising that little is known about the environmental 
      physiology of sub-Antarctic springtails and that few studies have explicitly tested 
      the hypothesis that invasive species will outperform indigenous ones under warmer 
      conditions. Here we present thermal tolerance data on three invasive 
      (Pogonognathellus flavescens, Isotomurus cf. palustris, Ceratophysella denticulata) 
      and two indigenous (Cryptopygus antarcticus, Tullbergia bisetosa) species of 
      springtails from Marion Island, explicitly testing the idea that consistent 
      differences exist between the indigenous and invasive species both in their absolute 
      limits and the ways in which they respond to acclimation (at temperatures from 0 to 
      20 degrees C). Phenotypic plasticity is the first in a series of ways in which 
      organisms might respond to altered environments. Using a poorly explored, but highly 
      appropriate technique, we demonstrate that in these species the crystallization 
      temperature (Tc) is equal to the lower lethal temperature. We also show that cooling 
      rate (1 degree C min(-1); 0.1 degrees C min(-1); 0.5 degrees C h(-1) from 5 to -1 
      degrees C followed by 0.1 degrees C min(-1)) has little effect on Tc. The indigenous 
      species typically have low Tcs (c. -20 to -13 degrees C depending on the acclimation 
      temperature), whilst those of the invasive species tend to be higher (c. -12 to -6 
      degrees C) at the lower acclimation temperatures. However, Ceratophysella 
      denticulata is an exception with a low Tc (c. -20 to -18 degrees C), and in P. 
      flavescens acclimation to 20 degrees C results in a pronounced decline in Tc. In 
      general, the invasive and alien species do not differ substantially in acclimation 
      effects on Tc (with the exception of the strong response in P. flavescens). Upper 
      lethal temperatures (ULT50) are typically higher in the invasive (33-37 degrees C) 
      than in the indigenous (30-33 degrees C) species and the response to acclimation 
      differs among the two groups. The indigenous species show either a weak response to 
      acclimation or ULT50 declines with increasing acclimation temperature, whereas in 
      the invasive species ULT50 increases with acclimation temperature. These findings 
      support the hypothesis that many invasive species will be favoured by climate change 
      (warming and drying) at Marion Island. Moreover, manipulative field experiments have 
      shown abundance changes in the indigenous and invasive springtail species in the 
      direction predicted by the physiological data.

TI  - Woody-plant ecosystems under climate change and air pollution-response consistencies 
      across zonobiomes?
PG  - 706-732
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpx009 [doi]
AB  - Forests store the largest terrestrial pools of carbon (C), helping to stabilize the 
      global climate system, yet are threatened by climate change (CC) and associated air 
      pollution (AP, highlighting ozone (O3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx)). We adopt the 
      perspective that CC-AP drivers and physiological impacts are universal, resulting in 
      consistent stress responses of forest ecosystems across zonobiomes. Evidence 
      supporting this viewpoint is presented from the literature on ecosystem gross/net 
      primary productivity and water cycling. Responses to CC-AP are compared across 
      evergreen/deciduous foliage types, discussing implications of nutrition and resource 
      turnover at tree and ecosystem scales. The availability of data is extremely uneven 
      across zonobiomes, yet unifying patterns of ecosystem response are discernable. 
      Ecosystem warming results in trade-offs between respiration and biomass production, 
      affecting high elevation forests more than in the lowland tropics and low-elevation 
      temperate zone. Resilience to drought is modulated by tree size and species 
      richness. Elevated O3 tends to counteract stimulation by elevated carbon dioxide 
      (CO2). Biotic stress and genomic structure ultimately determine ecosystem 
      responsiveness. Aggrading early- rather than mature late-successional communities 
      respond to CO2 enhancement, whereas O3 affects North American and Eurasian tree 
      species consistently under free-air fumigation. Insect herbivory is exacerbated by 
      CC-AP in biome-specific ways. Rhizosphere responses reflect similar stand-level 
      nutritional dynamics across zonobiomes, but are modulated by differences in 
      tree-soil nutrient cycling between deciduous and evergreen systems, and natural 
      versus anthropogenic nitrogen (N) oversupply. The hypothesis of consistency of 
      forest responses to interacting CC-AP is supported by currently available data, 
      establishing the precedent for a global network of long-term coordinated research 
      sites across zonobiomes to simultaneously advance both bottom-up (e.g., mechanistic) 
      and top-down (systems-level) understanding. This global, synthetic approach is 
      needed because high biological plasticity and physiographic variation across 
      individual ecosystems currently limit development of predictive models of forest 
      responses to CC-AP. Integrated research on C and nutrient cycling, O3-vegetation 
      interactions and water relations must target mechanisms' ecosystem responsiveness. 
      Worldwide case studies must be subject to biostatistical exploration to elucidate 
      overarching response patterns and synthesize the resulting empirical data through 
      advanced modelling, in order to provide regionally coherent, yet globally integrated 
      information in support of internationally coordinated decision-making and policy 
      development.

TI  - Immediate early gene expression in the vestibular nuclei and related vegetative 
      areas in rats during space flight.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - Changes in neuronal activity resulting in somatic and vegetative deficits occur 
      during different space flight conditions. Immediate early genes (IEGs: c-fos and 
      Fos-related antigen [FRA]) are useful indicators of changes in neuronal activity and 
      plasticity. They are induced within minutes of several extracellular stimulations, 
      while the corresponding proteins persist for hours (Fos) or days (FRAs). Changes in 
      IEG expression are likely to contribute to adaptation to microgravity and 
      readaptation to the terrestrial environment. During the NASA Neurolab Mission 
      (STS-90), changes in IEG expression were studied in adult male albino rats (Fisher 
      344) sacrificed at flight day (FD) 2 (24 h after launch), FD14 and at similar time 
      points after re-entry (R + 1, 24 h after re-entry, and R + 13). These time points 
      were chosen to maximize the probability of detecting changes in IEG expression 
      related to changes in gravitational fields occurring during the mission, e.g. (i) 
      increase in gravitational force from 1 to 3 g during the launch, before reaching 
      about 0 g at FD2; (ii) adaptation to 0 g at FD14; (iii) increase in gravity from 0 
      to approximately 1.5-1.8 g before reaching 1 g at R + 1; and (iv) readaptation to 1 
      g at R + 13. Fos- and FRA-positive cells were identified in the brainstem of flight 
      rats and ground-based controls using immunocytochemistry. With respect to control 
      rats, the number of labeled cells increased in flight animals in the medial and 
      spinal vestibular nuclei (but not in the lateral vestibular nucleus) at FD2, 
      decreased at FD14, greatly increased at R + 1 and returned to baseline levels at R + 
      13. Similar changes in IEG expression were also observed in the nucleus of the 
      solitary tract, the area postrema and the central nucleus of the amygdala. In 
      particular, in these vegetative areas the number of Fos-positive cells decreased in 
      flight rats with respect to controls at FD14, i.e. after exposure to 0 g, but 
      significantly increased at R + 1, i.e. after return to 1 g. Thus, altered 
      gravitational fields produced molecular changes in vestibular nuclei controlling 
      somatic functions, as well as in related medullary and basal forebrain structures 
      regulating vegetative functions.

TI  - Biogeographic position and body size jointly set lower thermal limits of wandering 
      spiders.
PG  - 3347-3356
LID - 10.1002/ece3.7286 [doi]
AB  - Most species encounter large variations in abiotic conditions along their 
      distribution range. The physiological responses of most terrestrial ectotherms (such 
      as insects and spiders) to clinal gradients of climate, and in particular gradients 
      of temperature, can be the product of both phenotypic plasticity and local 
      adaptation. This study aimed to determine how the biogeographic position of 
      populations and the body size of individuals set the limits of cold (freezing) 
      resistance of Dolomedes fimbriatus. We compared D. fimbriatus to its sister species 
      Dolomedes plantarius under harsher climatic conditions in their distribution range. 
      Using an ad hoc design, we sampled individuals from four populations of Dolomedes 
      fimbriatus originating from contrasting climatic areas (temperate and continental 
      climate) and one population of the sister species D. plantarius from continental 
      climate, and compared their supercooling ability as an indicator of cold resistance. 
      Results for D. fimbriatus indicated that spiders from northern (continental) 
      populations had higher cold resistance than spiders from southern (temperate) 
      populations. Larger spiders had a lower supercooling ability in northern 
      populations. The red-listed and rarest D. plantarius was slightly less cold tolerant 
      than the more common D. fimbriatus, and this might be of importance in a context of 
      climate change that could imply colder overwintering habitats in the north due to 
      reduced snow cover protection. The lowest cold resistance might put D. plantarius at 
      risk of extinction in the future, and this should be considered in conservation 
      plan.

AB  - The insulin/insulin-like signaling pathway (IIS) has been shown to mediate life 
      history trade-offs in mammalian model organisms, but the function of this pathway in 
      wild and non-mammalian organisms is understudied. Populations of western terrestrial 
      garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) around Eagle Lake, California, have evolved 
      variation in growth and maturation rates, mortality senescence rates, and annual 
      reproductive output that partition into two ecotypes: "fast-living" and 
      "slow-living". Thus, genes associated with the IIS network are good candidates for 
      investigating the mechanisms underlying ecological divergence in this system. We 
      reared neonates from each ecotype for 1.5years under two thermal treatments. We then 
      used qPCR to compare mRNA expression levels in three tissue types (brain, liver, 
      skeletal muscle) for four genes (igf1, igf2, igf1r, igf2r), and we used 
      radioimmunoassay to measure plasma IGF-1 and IGF-2 protein levels. Our results show 
      that, in contrast to most mammalian model systems, igf2 mRNA and protein levels 
      exceed those of igf1 and suggest an important role for igf2 in postnatal growth in 
      reptiles. Thermal rearing treatment and recent growth had greater impacts on IGF 
      levels than genetic background (i.e., ecotype), and the two ecotypes responded 
      similarly. This suggests that observed ecotypic differences in field measures of 
      IGFs may more strongly reflect plastic responses in different environments than 
      evolutionary divergence. Future analyses of additional components of the IIS pathway 
      and sequence divergence between the ecotypes will further illuminate how 
      environmental and genetic factors influence the endocrine system and its role in 
      mediating life history trade-offs.

AB  - Human demands on marine resources and space are currently unprecedented and concerns 
      are rising over observed declines in marine biodiversity. A quantitative 
      understanding of the impact of industrial activities on the marine environment is 
      thus essential. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a widely applied method for 
      quantifying the environmental impact of products and processes. LCA was originally 
      developed to assess the impacts of land-based industries on mainly terrestrial and 
      freshwater ecosystems. As such, impact indicators for major drivers of marine 
      biodiversity loss are currently lacking. We review quantitative approaches for 
      cause-effect assessment of seven major drivers of marine biodiversity loss: climate 
      change, ocean acidification, eutrophication-induced hypoxia, seabed damage, 
      overexploitation of biotic resources, invasive species and marine plastic debris. 
      Our review shows that impact indicators can be developed for all identified drivers, 
      albeit at different levels of coverage of cause-effect pathways and variable levels 
      of uncertainty and spatial coverage. Modeling approaches to predict the spatial 
      distribution and intensity of human-driven interventions in the marine environment 
      are relatively well-established and can be employed to develop spatially-explicit 
      LCA fate factors. Modeling approaches to quantify the effects of these interventions 
      on marine biodiversity are less well-developed. We highlight specific research 
      challenges to facilitate a coherent incorporation of marine biodiversity loss in 
      LCA, thereby making LCA a more comprehensive and robust environmental impact 
      assessment tool. Research challenges of particular importance include i) 
      incorporation of the non-linear behavior of global circulation models (GCMs) within 
      an LCA framework and ii) improving spatial differentiation, especially the 
      representation of coastal regions in GCMs and ocean-carbon cycle models.

AB  - Microplastics become one of the serious persistent pollutants in terrestrial 
      environments, and thus may represent a threat to the quality of soil and inhabiting 
      organisms. It is imperative to understand occurrence and distribution of 
      microplastics in soils. In this study, a large-scale field survey encompassing 85 
      locations along the lower reaches of Yangtze River and estuary was performed to 
      investigate the microplastics abundance in agricultural soils. Microplastics were 
      isolated from all the samples and all depths (0-80 cm). The microplastics abundance 
      in soils ranged from 4.94 items/kg to 252.70 items/kg, with an average of 37.32 
      items/kg. The most common microplastic type detected was Polypropylene (PP) 
      occurring as white fragments with sizes ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. Abiotic 
      parameters such as soil pH and texture were the general factors being associated 
      with microplastic abundance. Meantime, traffic was indicated as one important factor 
      to affect the microplastic abundance. Overall, the road input seems to be the main 
      source of microplastic pollution in agricultural areas along the Yangtze River and 
      estuary. Further studies should elucidate the original of the plastic fragments in 
      order to establish a baseline for regulative initiatives securing environmental 
      protection.

LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23437 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effects of phylogeny and locomotor behavior on long bone structural 
      proportions are assessed through comparisons between adult and ontogenetic samples 
      of extant gorillas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 281 wild-collected individuals 
      were included in the study, divided into four groups that vary taxonomically and 
      ecologically: western lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla), lowland and highland grauer 
      gorillas (G. b. graueri), and Virunga mountain gorillas (G. b. beringei). Lengths 
      and articular breadths of the major long bones (except the fibula) were measured, 
      and diaphyseal cross-sectional geometric properties determined using computed 
      tomography. Ages of immature specimens (n = 145) were known or estimated from dental 
      development. Differences between groups in hind limb to forelimb proportions were 
      assessed in both adults and during development. RESULTS: Diaphyseal strength 
      proportions among adults vary in parallel with behavioral/ecological differences, 
      and not phylogeny. The more arboreal western lowland and lowland grauer gorillas 
      have relatively stronger forelimbs than the more terrestrial Virunga mountain 
      gorillas, while the behaviorally intermediate highland grauer gorillas have 
      intermediate proportions. Diaphyseal strength proportions are similar in young 
      infants but diverge after 2 years of age in western lowland and mountain gorillas, 
      at the same time that changes in locomotor behavior occur. There are no differences 
      between groups in length or articular proportions among either adults or immature 
      individuals. CONCLUSION: Long bone diaphyseal strength proportions in gorillas are 
      developmentally plastic, reflecting behavior, while length and articular proportions 
      are much more genetically canalized. These findings have implications for 
      interpreting morphological variation among fossil taxa.

      development.
PG  - 18555-60
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1306495110 [doi]
AB  - The tongue is a critical element of the feeding system in tetrapod animals for their 
      successful adaptation to terrestrial life. Whereas the oral part of the mammalian 
      tongue contains soft tissues only, the avian tongue has an internal skeleton 
      extending to the anterior tip. The mechanisms underlying the evolutionary divergence 
      in tongue skeleton formation are completely unknown. We show here that the 
      odd-skipped related-1 (Osr1) transcription factor is expressed throughout the neural 
      crest-derived tongue mesenchyme in mouse, but not in chick, embryos during early 
      tongue morphogenesis. Neural crest-specific inactivation of Osr1 resulted in 
      formation of an ectopic cartilage in the mouse tongue, reminiscent in shape and 
      developmental ontogeny of the anterior tongue cartilage in chick. SRY-box containing 
      gene-9 (Sox9), the master regulator of chondrogenesis, is widely expressed in the 
      nascent tongue mesenchyme at the onset of tongue morphogenesis but its expression is 
      dramatically down-regulated concomitant with activation of Osr1 expression in the 
      developing mouse tongue. In Osr1 mutant mouse embryos, expression of Sox9 persisted 
      in the developing tongue mesenchyme where chondrogenesis is subsequently activated 
      to form the ectopic cartilage. Furthermore, we show that Osr1 binds to the Sox9 gene 
      promoter and that overexpression of Osr1 suppressed expression of endogenous Sox9 
      mRNAs and Sox9 promoter-driven reporter. These data indicate that Osr1 normally 
      prevents chondrogenesis in the mammalian tongue through repression of Sox9 
      expression and suggest that changes in regulation of Osr1 expression in the neural 
      crest-derived tongue mesenchyme underlie the evolutionary divergence of birds from 
      other vertebrates in tongue morphogenesis.

AB  - Management of municipal solid wastes in many countries consists of waste disposal 
      into landfill without treatment or selective collection of solid waste fractions 
      including plastics, paper, glass, metals, electronic waste, and organic fraction 
      leading to the unsolved problem of contamination of numerous ecosystems such as air, 
      soil, surface, and ground water. Knowledge of leachate composition is critical in 
      risk assessment of long-term impact of landfills on human health and the environment 
      as well as for prevention of negative outcomes. The research presented in this paper 
      investigates the seasonal variation of draining leachate composition and resulting 
      toxicity as well as the contamination status of soil/sediment from lagoon basins 
      receiving leachates from landfill in Mpasa, a suburb of Kinshasa in the Democratic 
      Republic of the Congo. Samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons and 
      analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, soluble ions, toxic 
      metals, and were then subjected to toxicity tests. Results highlight the significant 
      seasonal difference in leachate physicochemical composition. Affected soil/sediment 
      showed higher values for toxic metals than leachates, indicating the possibility of 
      using lagoon system for the purification of landfill leachates, especially for 
      organic matter and heavy metal sedimentation. However, the ecotoxicity tests 
      demonstrated that leachates are still a significant source of toxicity for 
      terrestrial and benthic organisms. Therefore, landfill leachates should not be 
      discarded into the environment (soil or surface water) without prior treatment. 
      Interest in the use of macrophytes in lagoon system is growing and toxic metal 
      retention in lagoon basin receiving systems needs to be fully investigated in the 
      future. This study presents useful tools for evaluating landfill leachate quality 
      and risk in lagoon systems which can be applied to similar environmental 
      compartments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation can affect several aspects ranging from 
      plant growth to metabolic regulation. Maca is a Brassicaceae crop native to the 
      Andes growing in above 3500 m of altitude. Although maca has been the focus mainly 
      due to its nutraceutical properties, it remains unknown how maca plants tolerate to 
      harsh environments, such as strong UV-B. Here, we present the first study that 
      reports the physiological responses of maca plants to counteract and recover to 
      repeated acute UV-B irradiation. RESULTS: In detail, plants were daily exposed to 
      acute UV-B irradiation followed by a recovery period under controlled conditions. 
      The results showed that repeated acute UV-B exposures reduced biomass and 
      photosynthetic parameters, with gradual senescence induction in exposed leaves, 
      reduction of young leaves expansion and root growth inhibition. Negative correlation 
      between increased UV-B and recovery was observed, with marked production of new 
      biomass in plants treated one week or more. CONCLUSIONS: A differential UV-B 
      response was observed: stress response was mainly controlled by a coordinated 
      source-sink carbon allocation, while acclimation process may require UV-B-specific 
      systemic defense response reflected on the phenotypic plasticity of maca plants. 
      Moreover, these differential UV-B responses were also suggested by multifactorial 
      analysis based on biometric and physiological data.

TI  - Dissecting the Environmental Consequences of Bacillus thuringiensis Application for 
      Natural Ecosystems.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13050355 [doi]
LID - 355
AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a natural pathogen of different invertebrates, 
      primarily insects, is widely used as a biological control agent. While Bt-based 
      preparations are claimed to be safe for non-target organisms due to the immense host 
      specificity of the bacterium, the growing evidence witnesses the distant 
      consequences of their application for natural communities. For instance, upon 
      introduction to soil habitats, Bt strains can affect indigenous microorganisms, such 
      as bacteria and fungi, and further establish complex relationships with local 
      plants, ranging from a mostly beneficial demeanor, to pathogenesis-like plant 
      colonization. By exerting a direct effect on target insects, Bt can indirectly 
      affect other organisms in the food chain. Furthermore, they can also exert an 
      off-target activity on various soil and terrestrial invertebrates, and the frequent 
      acquisition of virulence factors unrelated to major insecticidal toxins can extend 
      the Bt host range to vertebrates, including humans. Even in the absence of direct 
      detrimental effects, the exposure to Bt treatment may affect non-target organisms by 
      reducing prey base and its nutritional value, resulting in delayed alleviation of 
      their viability. The immense phenotypic plasticity of Bt strains, coupled with the 
      complexity of ecological relationships they can engage in, indicates that further 
      assessment of future Bt-based pesticides' safety should consider multiple levels of 
      ecosystem organization and extend to a wide variety of their inhabitants.

AB  - Members of the phylum Acidobacteria are abundant and ubiquitous across soils. We 
      performed a large-scale comparative genome analysis spanning subdivisions 1, 3, 4, 
      6, 8 and 23 (n = 24) with the goal to identify features to help explain their 
      prevalence in soils and understand their ecophysiology. Our analysis revealed that 
      bacteriophage integration events along with transposable and mobile elements 
      influenced the structure and plasticity of these genomes. Low- and high-affinity 
      respiratory oxygen reductases were detected in multiple genomes, suggesting the 
      capacity for growing across different oxygen gradients. Among many genomes, the 
      capacity to use a diverse collection of carbohydrates, as well as inorganic and 
      organic nitrogen sources (such as via extracellular peptidases), was detected - both 
      advantageous traits in environments with fluctuating nutrient environments. We also 
      identified multiple soil acidobacteria with the potential to scavenge atmospheric 
      concentrations of H(2) , now encompassing mesophilic soil strains within the 
      subdivision 1 and 3, in addition to a previously identified thermophilic strain in 
      subdivision 4. This large-scale acidobacteria genome analysis reveal traits that 
      provide genomic, physiological and metabolic versatility, presumably allowing 
      flexibility and versatility in the challenging and fluctuating soil environment.

TI  - Fluctuating optimum and temporally variable selection on breeding date in birds and 
      mammals.
PG  - 31969-31978
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2009003117 [doi]
AB  - Temporal variation in natural selection is predicted to strongly impact the 
      evolution and demography of natural populations, with consequences for the rate of 
      adaptation, evolution of plasticity, and extinction risk. Most of the theory 
      underlying these predictions assumes a moving optimum phenotype, with predictions 
      expressed in terms of the temporal variance and autocorrelation of this optimum. 
      However, empirical studies seldom estimate patterns of fluctuations of an optimum 
      phenotype, precluding further progress in connecting theory with observations. To 
      bridge this gap, we assess the evidence for temporal variation in selection on 
      breeding date by modeling a fitness function with a fluctuating optimum, across 39 
      populations of 21 wild animals, one of the largest compilations of long-term 
      datasets with individual measurements of trait and fitness components. We find 
      compelling evidence for fluctuations in the fitness function, causing temporal 
      variation in the magnitude, but not the direction of selection. However, 
      fluctuations of the optimum phenotype need not directly translate into variation in 
      selection gradients, because their impact can be buffered by partial tracking of the 
      optimum by the mean phenotype. Analyzing individuals that reproduce in consecutive 
      years, we find that plastic changes track movements of the optimum phenotype across 
      years, especially in bird species, reducing temporal variation in directional 
      selection. This suggests that phenological plasticity has evolved to cope with 
      fluctuations in the optimum, despite their currently modest contribution to 
      variation in selection.

TI  - Long-term Potentiation Decay and Poor Long-lasting Memory Process in the Wild 
      Rodents Proechimys from Brazil's Amazon Rainforest.
PG  - 2

LID - 2
AB  - Proechimys are small terrestrial rodents from Amazon rainforest. Each animal species 
      is adapted to a specific environment in which the animal evolved therefore without 
      comparative approaches unique characteristics of distinct species cannot be fully 
      recognized. Laboratory rodents are exceedingly inbred strains dissociated from their 
      native habitats and their fundamental ecological aspects are abstracted. Thus, the 
      employment of exotic non-model species can be informative and complement 
      conventional animal models. With the aim of promoting comparative studies between 
      the exotic wildlife populations in the laboratory and traditional rodent model, we 
      surveyed a type of synaptic plasticity intimately related to memory encoding in 
      animals. Using theta-burst paradigm, in vitro long-term potentiation (LTP) in the 
      CA1 subfield of hippocampal slices was assessed in the Amazon rodents Proechimys and 
      Wistar rats. Memory, learning and anxiety were investigated through the plus-maze 
      discriminative avoidance task (PM-DAT) and object recognition test. In PM-DAT, both 
      animal species were submitted to two test sessions (3-h and 24-h) after the 
      conditioning training. Proechimys exhibited higher anxiety-like behavior in the 
      training session but during test sessions both species exhibited similar patterns of 
      anxiety-related behavior. After 3-h of the training, Proechimys and Wistar spent 
      significantly less time in the aversive enclosed arm than in the non-aversive arm. 
      But, at 24-h after training, Wistar rats remained less time in the aversive closed 
      arm in comparison with the non-aversive one, while Proechimys rodents spent the same 
      amount of time in both enclosed arms. In the object recognition test, both species 
      were evaluated at 24-h after the acquisition session and similar findings than those 
      of the PM-DAT (24-h) were obtained, suggesting that long-term memory duration did 
      not persist for 24-h in the Amazon rodent. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials 
      recordings revealed that LTP decays rapidly over time reaching basal levels at 90 
      min after theta-burst stimulation in Proechimys, contrasting to the stable LTP found 
      in the Wistar rats which was observed throughout 3-h recording period. These 
      findings suggest a link between the LTP decay and the lack of 24-h long-lasting 
      memory process in Proechimys. Nevertheless, why early-phase LTP in Proechimys decays 
      very rapidly remains to be elucidated.

AB  - For over 50 years, the great tit (Parus major) has been a model species for research 
      in evolutionary, ecological and behavioural research; in particular, learning and 
      cognition have been intensively studied. Here, to provide further insight into the 
      molecular mechanisms behind these important traits, we de novo assemble a great tit 
      reference genome and whole-genome re-sequence another 29 individuals from across 
      Europe. We show an overrepresentation of genes related to neuronal functions, 
      learning and cognition in regions under positive selection, as well as increased CpG 
      methylation in these regions. In addition, great tit neuronal non-CpG methylation 
      patterns are very similar to those observed in mammals, suggesting a universal role 
      in neuronal epigenetic regulation which can affect learning-, memory- and 
      experience-induced plasticity. The high-quality great tit genome assembly will play 
      an instrumental role in furthering the integration of ecological, evolutionary, 
      behavioural and genomic approaches in this model species.

TI  - Cell Plasticity and Genomic Structure of a Novel Filterable Rhizobiales Bacterium 
      that Belongs to a Widely Distributed Lineage.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8091373 [doi]
LID - 1373
AB  - Rhizobiales bacterium strain IZ6 is a novel filterable bacterium that was isolated 
      from a suspension filtrate (<0.22 µm) of soil collected in Shimane Prefecture, 
      western Japan. Additional closely related isolates were recovered from filterable 
      fractions of terrestrial environmental samples collected from other places in Japan; 
      the Gobi Desert, north-central China; and Svalbard, Arctic Norway. These findings 
      indicate a wide distribution of this lineage. This study reports the cell variation 
      and genomic structure of IZ6. When cultured at lower temperatures (4 °C and 15 °C), 
      this strain contained ultra-small cells and cell-like particles in the filtrate. 
      PacBio sequencing revealed that this chromosome (3,114,641 bp) contained 3150 
      protein-coding, 51 tRNA, and three rRNA genes. IZ6 showed low 16S rRNA gene sequence 
      identity (<97%) and low average nucleotide identity (<76%) with its closest known 
      relative, Flaviflagellibacter deserti. Unlike the methylotrophic bacteria and 
      nitrogen-fixing bacteria in related genera, there were no genes that encoded enzymes 
      for one-carbon-compound utilization and nitrogen fixation in the IZ6 genome; the 
      genes related to nitrate and nitrite reductase are retained and those related to the 
      cell membrane function tend to be slightly enriched in the genome. This genomic 
      information helps elucidate the eco-physiological function of a phenotypically 
      heterogeneous and diverse Rhizobiales group.

TI  - Functional ecology of an Antarctic Dry Valley.
PG  - 8990-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1300643110 [doi]
AB  - The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest ice-free region in Antarctica and are 
      critically at risk from climate change. The terrestrial landscape is dominated by 
      oligotrophic mineral soils and extensive exposed rocky surfaces where biota are 
      largely restricted to microbial communities, although their ability to perform the 
      majority of geobiological processes has remained largely uncharacterized. Here, we 
      identified functional traits that drive microbial survival and community assembly, 
      using a metagenomic approach with GeoChip-based functional gene arrays to establish 
      metabolic capabilities in communities inhabiting soil and rock surface niches in 
      McKelvey Valley. Major pathways in primary metabolism were identified, indicating 
      significant plasticity in autotrophic, heterotrophic, and diazotrophic strategies 
      supporting microbial communities. This represents a major advance beyond 
      biodiversity surveys in that we have now identified how putative functional ecology 
      drives microbial community assembly. Significant differences were apparent between 
      open soil, hypolithic, chasmoendolithic, and cryptoendolithic communities. A suite 
      of previously unappreciated Antarctic microbial stress response pathways, thermal, 
      osmotic, and nutrient limitation responses were identified and related to 
      environmental stressors, offering tangible clues to the mechanisms behind the 
      enduring success of microorganisms in this seemingly inhospitable terrain. Rocky 
      substrates exposed to larger fluctuations in environmental stress supported greater 
      functional diversity in stress-response pathways than soils. Soils comprised a 
      unique reservoir of genes involved in transformation of organic hydrocarbons and 
      lignin-like degradative pathways. This has major implications for the evolutionary 
      origin of the organisms, turnover of recalcitrant substrates in Antarctic soils, and 
      predicting future responses to anthropogenic pollution.

      of their continuous accumulation in both marine and terrestrial environment, but 
      also due to their serious threats posed to the environment. Voluminous studies 
      regarding sources, distribution characterization, and fate of MPs in the different 
      environmental compartments (e.g., marine, freshwater, wastewater, and soil) have 
      been reported since 2004, whereas MPs pollution in unique marine ecosystems (e.g., 
      coastal mangrove habitat) receives little scientific attention. Mangrove ecosystem, 
      an important buffer between the land and the sea, has been identified as a potential 
      sink of MPs caused by both marine and land-based activities. Moreover, the source 
      and distribution characteristics of MPs in this ecosystem are significantly 
      different from other coastal habitats, mainly owing to its unique features of high 
      productivity and biomass. With the impetus to provide a more integrated view of MPs 
      pollution in mangrove habitats, a literature review was conducted based on the 
      existing studies related to this topic. This is the first review to present the 
      current state of MPs pollution in mangrove ecosystems, specially including (i) the 
      possible sources of MPs in mangrove areas and their pathways entering into this 
      habitat; (ii) MPs pollution in the different mangrove compartments (including 
      surface seawater, sediments, and biotas); and (iii) factors influencing MPs 
      distribution in mangrove areas. Toward that end, the research gaps are proposed to 
      guide for future research priorities.

TI  - The Role of the Reactive Species Involved in the Photocatalytic Degradation of HDPE 
      Microplastics Using C,N-TiO(2) Powders.
LID - 10.3390/polym13070999 [doi]
LID - 999
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are distributed in a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial 
      ecosystems throughout the planet. They are known to adsorb hazardous substances and 
      can transfer them across the trophic web. To eliminate MPs pollution in an 
      environmentally friendly process, we propose using a photocatalytic process that can 
      easily be implemented in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As photocatalysis 
      involves the formation of reactive species such as holes (h(+)), electrons (e(-)), 
      hydroxyl (OH(●)), and superoxide ion (O(2)(●-)) radicals, it is imperative to 
      determine the role of those species in the degradation process to design an 
      effective photocatalytic system. However, for MPs, this information is limited in 
      the literature. Therefore, we present such reactive species' role in the degradation 
      of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) MPs using C,N-TiO(2). Tert-butanol, isopropyl 
      alcohol (IPA), Tiron, and Cu(NO(3))(2) were confirmed as adequate OH(●), h(+), 
      O(2)(●-) and e(-) scavengers. These results revealed for the first time that the 
      formation of free OH(●) through the pathways involving the photogenerated e(-) plays 
      an essential role in the MPs' degradation. Furthermore, the degradation behaviors 
      observed when h(+) and O(2)(●-) were removed from the reaction system suggest that 
      these species can also perform the initiating step of degradation.

AB  - Oxygen uptake by the pulmonary circulation is a chemical reaction. The 
      physicochemical attributes of oxygen are critical when studying pulmonary oxygen 
      toxicity. Extent of lung injury depends on the percentage of oxygen in an 
      oxygen-nitrogen mix in polybaric circumstances (Shanklin, 1969). Further change in 
      extent of lesion follows when other gases are used in the inhalant mix instead of 
      nitrogen (Shanklin and Lester, 1972), with oxygen at 21-100% of the mix. Comparative 
      subatmospheric oxygen levels down to 3% in hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, argon, or 
      sulfur hexafluoride, were run with and without ventilatory distress by the Farber 
      (1937) model, bilateral cervical vagotomy (BCV). This yielded coherent results 
      indicating a need to consider molecular characteristics at the atomic level. 
      Molecular mass and size, gas viscosity, and thermal conductivity yielded no obvious 
      correlates to lung injury. Saturation of the outer electron shells of the diluents 
      fit the empiric data, prospectively an interaction between oxygen and nitrogen from 
      their electronegativity and closely approximate molecular mass, size, and shape. The 
      lesion is essentially eliminated at 7% oxygen in nitrogen. At 3% oxygen, the least 
      lesion is found with N(2), H(2), and SF(6), all gases with incomplete outer electron 
      shells, allowing for transient, possibly polarized, covalent bonding with oxygen as 
      the significant minority component in the mix. Argon and helium do not interfere 
      with oxygen. With 3% oxygen in argon without BCV, the experiments ran so long 
      (>70hours) they were terminated once the point had been made. 3% oxygen in argon 
      after BCV yielded a mean survival more than twice that of BCV in air, indicating a 
      remarkable degree of nitrogen interference with oxygen in the respiratory medium of 
      terrestrial animal life. Argon displayed other advantages for the lung compared to 
      nitrogen. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen are diatomic molecules, a feature which 
      does relate to the extent of lung injury, but only oxygen is paramagnetic. Magnetic 
      effects on lesion formation were tested: [1] with ventilatory distress induced in 
      newborn rabbits, and [2] in young adult female white mice exposed to 100% oxygen 
      without added mechanical distress. A noninvasive model for ventilatory distress, 
      thoracic restraint (TR), with longer mean survivals of 40-50hours, was employed 
      rather than the Farber model. Parallel runs with TR, one subset receiving 100% 
      oxygen in a plastic chamber resting on six strong ring magnets with measured fields 
      up to +1200 gauss, the other plain 100% oxygen, were performed. Both subsets 
      developed moderate metabolic acidosis with average weight losses circa 25%, but over 
      different time courses, 82.89±4.91hours in magnetized oxygen, 55.4% longer than the 
      53.34±9.82hours in plain oxygen (p<0.001). The longer survival in magnetized oxygen 
      meant extensive lung injury (99.57±0.42% pleural surface, versus 83.86±14.03%), but 
      the rate of lesion formation was 30.89% faster in plain oxygen (1.5722% per hour) 
      than in magnetized oxygen (1.2012% per hour), a difference significant at p<0.001. 
      The effect of oxygen without mechanical ventilatory distress was examined in female 
      adult white mice exposed to oxygen or magnetized oxygen. Similar survivals and 
      weight losses were achieved. The rate of lung lesion formation was different, 
      1.2617% per hour in plain oxygen, 46.13% faster than 0.8634% per hour in magnetized 
      oxygen. A variable magnetic field, with animals moving and breathing in chambers 
      flooded with oxygen, has both systemic and pulmonary effects which alter the rate of 
      lesion formation due to oxygen toxicity. Paramagnetic oxygen in a magnetic field 
      influences the effect of oxygen toxicity on the lung but at these strengths of field 
      it does not overcome significant mechanical disturbance.

TI  - Climatic breadth of calling behaviour in two widespread Neotropical frogs: Insights 
      from humidity extremes.
PG  - 5431-5446
LID - 10.1111/gcb.15266 [doi]
AB  - Climate change is severely altering precipitation regimes at local and global 
      scales, yet the capacity of species to cope with these changes has been 
      insufficiently examined. Amphibians are globally endangered and particularly 
      sensitive to moisture conditions. For mating, most amphibian species rely on calling 
      behaviour, which is a key weather-dependent trait. Using passive acoustics, we 
      monitored the calling behaviour of two widespread Neotropical frogs in 12 
      populations located at the humidity extremes but thermal mean of the species 
      distribution. Based on 2,554 hr of recordings over a breeding season, we found that 
      both the aquatic species Pseudis paradoxa and the arboreal species Boana raniceps 
      exhibited calling behaviour at a wide range of relative humidity. Calling humidity 
      was significantly lower in conspecific populations subjected to drier conditions, 
      while calling temperature did not differ between populations or species. Overall, no 
      variation in climatic breadth was observed between large and small choruses, and 
      calling behaviour was scarcely detected during the driest, hottest and coldest 
      potential periods of breeding. Our results showed that calling humidity of the 
      studied species varies according to the precipitation regime, suggesting that 
      widespread Neotropical anurans may have the capacity to exhibit sexual displays in 
      different climatic environments. Regardless of the underlying mechanism (plasticity 
      or local adaptation), which should be determined by common garden experiments, a 
      wide and population-specific climatic breadth of calling behaviour may assist 
      species to deal with changing humidity conditions. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first study to explore the response capacity of anurans to perform calling behaviour 
      under contrasting precipitation regimes.

AB  - Variations in crown forms promote canopy space-use and productivity in mixed-species 
      forests. However, we have a limited understanding on how this response is mediated 
      by changes in within-tree biomass allocation. Here, we explored the role of changes 
      in tree allometry, biomass allocation and architecture in shaping 
      diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs) in the oldest tropical tree diversity 
      experiment. We conducted whole-tree destructive biomass measurements and terrestrial 
      laser scanning. Spatially explicit models were built at the tree level to 
      investigate the effects of tree size and local neighbourhood conditions. Results 
      were then upscaled to the stand level, and mixture effects were explored using a 
      bootstrapping procedure. Biomass allocation and architecture substantially changed 
      in mixtures, which resulted from both tree-size effects and neighbourhood-mediated 
      plasticity. Shifts in biomass allocation among branch orders explained substantial 
      shares of the observed overyielding. By contrast, root-to-shoot ratios, as well as 
      the allometric relationships between tree basal area and aboveground biomass, were 
      little affected by the local neighbourhood. Our results suggest that generic 
      allometric equations can be used to estimate forest aboveground biomass overyielding 
      from diameter inventory data. Overall, we demonstrate that shifts in tree biomass 
      allocation are mediated by the local neighbourhood and promote DPRs in tropical 
      forests.

TI  - Trabecular architecture in the forelimb epiphyses of extant xenarthrans (Mammalia).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone structure has a crucial role in the functional adaptations that 
      allow vertebrates to conduct their diverse lifestyles. Much has been documented 
      regarding the diaphyseal structure of long bones of tetrapods. However, the 
      architecture of trabecular bone, which is for instance found within the epiphyses of 
      long bones, and which has been shown experimentally to be extremely plastic, has 
      received little attention in the context of lifestyle adaptations (virtually only in 
      primates). We therefore investigated the forelimb epiphyses of extant xenarthrans, 
      the placental mammals including the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos. They are 
      characterised by several lifestyles and degrees of fossoriality involving distinct 
      uses of their forelimb. We used micro computed tomography data to acquire 3D 
      trabecular parameters at regions of interest (ROIs) for all extant genera of 
      xenarthrans (with replicates). Traditional, spherical, and phylogenetically informed 
      statistics (including the consideration of size effects) were used to characterise 
      the functional signal of these parameters. RESULTS: Several trabecular parameters 
      yielded functional distinctions. The main direction of the trabeculae distinguished 
      lifestyle categories for one ROI (the radial trochlea). Among the other trabecular 
      parameters, it is the degree of anisotropy (i.e., a preferential alignment of the 
      trabeculae) that yielded the clearest functional signal. For all ROIs, the 
      armadillos, which represent the fully terrestrial and fossorial category, were found 
      as characterised by a greater degree of anisotropy (i.e., more aligned trabeculae). 
      Furthermore, the trabeculae of the humeral head of the most fossorial armadillos 
      were also found to be more anisotropic than in the less fossorial species. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Most parameters were marked by an important intraspecific variability 
      and by a size effect, which could, at least partly, be masking the functional 
      signal. But for some parameters, the degree of anisotropy in particular, a clear 
      functional distinction was recovered. Along with data on primates, our findings 
      suggest that a trabecular architecture characterised by a greater degree of 
      anisotropy is to be expected in species in which the relevant epiphyses withstand a 
      restricted range of load directions. Trabecular architecture therefore is a 
      promising research avenue for the reconstruction of lifestyles in extinct or cryptic 
      species.

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary legacy of megafauna extinctions.
PG  - 845-862
LID - 10.1111/brv.12374 [doi]
AB  - For hundreds of millions of years, large vertebrates (megafauna) have inhabited most 
      of the ecosystems on our planet. During the late Quaternary, notably during the Late 
      Pleistocene and the early Holocene, Earth experienced a rapid extinction of large, 
      terrestrial vertebrates. While much attention has been paid to understanding the 
      causes of this massive megafauna extinction, less attention has been given to 
      understanding the impacts of loss of megafauna on other organisms with whom they 
      interacted. In this review, we discuss how the loss of megafauna disrupted and 
      reshaped ecological interactions, and explore the ecological consequences of the 
      ongoing decline of large vertebrates. Numerous late Quaternary extinct species of 
      predators, parasites, commensals and mutualistic partners were associated with 
      megafauna and were probably lost due to their strict dependence upon them 
      (co-extinctions). Moreover, many extant species have megafauna-adapted traits that 
      provided evolutionary benefits under past megafauna-rich conditions, but are now of 
      no or limited use (anachronisms). Morphological evolution and behavioural changes 
      allowed some of these species partially to overcome the absence of megafauna. 
      Although the extinction of megafauna led to a number of co-extinction events, 
      several species that likely co-evolved with megafauna established new interactions 
      with humans and their domestic animals. Species that were highly specialized in 
      interactions with megafauna, such as large predators, specialized parasites, and 
      large commensalists (e.g. scavengers, dung beetles), and could not adapt to new 
      hosts or prey were more likely to die out. Partners that were less megafauna 
      dependent persisted because of behavioural plasticity or by shifting their 
      dependency to humans via domestication, facilitation or pathogen spill-over, or 
      through interactions with domestic megafauna. We argue that the ongoing extinction 
      of the extant megafauna in the Anthropocene will catalyse another wave of 
      co-extinctions due to the enormous diversity of key ecological interactions and 
      functional roles provided by the megafauna.

TI  - Structural dynamics of RbmA governs plasticity of Vibrio cholerae biofilms.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.26163 [doi]
LID - e26163
AB  - Biofilm formation is critical for the infection cycle of Vibrio cholerae. Vibrio 
      exopolysaccharides (VPS) and the matrix proteins RbmA, Bap1 and RbmC are required 
      for the development of biofilm architecture. We demonstrate that RbmA binds VPS 
      directly and uses a binary structural switch within its first fibronectin type III 
      (FnIII-1) domain to control RbmA structural dynamics and the formation of 
      VPS-dependent higher-order structures. The structural switch in FnIII-1 regulates 
      interactions in trans with the FnIII-2 domain, leading to open (monomeric) or closed 
      (dimeric) interfaces. The ability of RbmA to switch between open and closed states 
      is important for V. cholerae biofilm formation, as RbmA variants with switches that 
      are locked in either of the two states lead to biofilms with altered architecture 
      and structural integrity.

AB  - Repeated deep dives are highly pro-oxidative events for air-breathing aquatic 
      foragers such as penguins. At fledging, the transition from a strictly terrestrial 
      to a marine lifestyle may therefore trigger a complex set of anti-oxidant responses 
      to prevent chronic oxidative stress in immature penguins but these processes are 
      still undefined. By combining in vivo and in vitro approaches with transcriptome 
      analysis, we investigated the adaptive responses of sea-acclimatized (SA) immature 
      king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) compared with pre-fledging never-immersed 
      (NI) birds. In vivo, experimental immersion into cold water stimulated a higher 
      thermogenic response in SA penguins than in NI birds, but both groups exhibited 
      hypothermia, a condition favouring oxidative stress. In vitro, the pectoralis 
      muscles of SA birds displayed increased oxidative capacity and mitochondrial protein 
      abundance but unchanged reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation per g tissue 
      because ROS production per mitochondria was reduced. The genes encoding 
      oxidant-generating proteins were down-regulated in SA birds while mRNA abundance and 
      activity of the main antioxidant enzymes were up-regulated. Genes encoding proteins 
      involved in repair mechanisms of oxidized DNA or proteins and in degradation 
      processes were also up-regulated in SA birds. Sea life also increased the degree of 
      fatty acid unsaturation in muscle mitochondrial membranes resulting in higher 
      intrinsic susceptibility to ROS. Oxidative damages to protein or DNA were reduced in 
      SA birds. Repeated experimental immersions of NI penguins in cold-water partially 
      mimicked the effects of acclimatization to marine life, modified the expression of 
      fewer genes related to oxidative stress but in a similar way as in SA birds and 
      increased oxidative damages to DNA. It is concluded that the multifaceted plasticity 
      observed after marine life may be crucial to maintain redox homeostasis in active 
      tissues subjected to high pro-oxidative pressure in diving birds. Initial immersions 
      in cold-water may initiate an hormetic response triggering essential changes in the 
      adaptive antioxidant response to marine life.

AB  - A mismatch between β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle flux in 
      mitochondria produces an accumulation of lipid metabolic intermediates, resulting in 
      both blunted metabolic flexibility and decreased glucose utilization in the affected 
      cells. The ability of the cell to switch to glucose as an energy substrate can be 
      restored by reducing the reliance of the cell on fatty acid oxidation. The 
      inhibition of the carnitine system, limiting the carnitine shuttle to the oxidation 
      of lipids in the mitochondria, allows cells to develop a high plasticity to 
      metabolic rewiring with a decrease in fatty acid oxidation and a parallel increase 
      in glucose oxidation. We found that 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazine)propionate (THP), 
      which is able to reduce cellular carnitine levels by blocking both carnitine 
      biosynthesis and the cell membrane carnitine/organic cation transporter (OCTN2), was 
      reported to improve mitochondrial dysfunction in several diseases, such as 
      Huntington's disease (HD). Here, new THP-derived carnitine-lowering agents (TCL), 
      characterized by a high affinity for the OCTN2 with a minimal effect on carnitine 
      synthesis, were developed, and their biological activities were evaluated in both in 
      vitro and in vivo HD models. Certain compounds showed promising biological 
      activities: reducing protein aggregates in HD cells, ameliorating motility defects, 
      and increasing the lifespan of HD Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - Introduction of alien species may significantly affect soil ecosystems, through 
      predation or disruption of components of native ecosystems (Winsor et al. 2004; 
      Álvarez-Presas et al. 2014; Justine et al. 2014). Land planarians have been reported 
      as alien species in soils throughout the world and, among those, some species are 
      considered to be successful invaders, e.g. Platydemus manokwari de Beauchamp, 1963, 
      Arthurdendyus triangulatus (Dendy, 1894), Bipalium adventitium Hyman, 1943, Bipalium 
      kewense Moseley, 1878 and Dolichoplana striata Moseley, 1877 (Winsor et al. 2004; 
      Álvarez-Presas et al. 2014; Justine et al. 2014, 2015). Soil moisture status seems 
      to be an important element for their successful invasion (Fraser & Boag 1998). In 
      Europe at least 18 species of alien land planarians have been recorded since now and 
      some of them are considered as invasive ones, e.g. P. manokwari (cf. Justine et al. 
      2014). Although the alien land planarian B. kewense has been reported to occur in 
      many greenhouses in Italy (Bello et al. 1995), no data are available on its 
      establishment and/or impact on natural environments. On 28<sup>th</sup> September 
      2014, 20 specimens (~1 individual/m<sup>2</sup>) of the land planarian 
      Diversibipalium multilineatum (Makino & Shirasawa, 1983) (Fig. 1), native to Japan, 
      were collected under pots, branches and plastic materials in a private garden 
      located in the center of Bologna (Emilia Romagna, Central Italy), near the urban 
      park Giardini Margherita (44°29' N, 11°21' E; WGS84). Thirty plant species (both 
      indigenous and alien), mainly cultivated as bonsai (e.g. Lagerstroemia indica L., 
      Juniperus procumbens (Siebold ex Endl.) Miquel), were present in this shady, wet 
      garden (25 m<sup>2</sup>). Between March 2014 and June 2015, 70 more specimens of D. 
      multilineatum were collected at the same site, mainly at dusk and dawn after rain. 
      Reproduction by fission and regeneration processes were observed in several of those 
      specimens, which were kept for some time in captivity. A specimen of D. 
      multilineatum was also collected in a garden in Léguevin (Haute-Garonne, France), 
      which will be described in a forthcoming paper by Justine et al. (in prep.) (see 
      also Kawakatsu et al. 2014). Specimens without a genital pore were initially 
      ascribed to D. multilineatum on the basis of their external appearance: the dorsal 
      surface was brownish yellow and presented five longitudinal stripes at the head 
      plate and the neck, showing the typical appearance of the species. The middorsal 
      stripe was widened at its anterior end, on the head plate, and at the pharynx level. 
      The ventral pattern of the animals at the pharyngeal region was also characteristic, 
      with the middorsal stripe widened at this level. The Italian Diversibipalium 
      specimens used for the molecular analysis were fixed and preserved in absolute 
      ethanol. Fragments of the mitochondrial gene COI and 28S ribosomal RNA nuclear gene 
      (GenBank Acc. Numbers KU245358 and KU245357, respectively) were obtained using the 
      procedure and COI primers described in Álvarez-Presas et al. (2008) and Solà et al. 
      (2013). The French specimen's COI (Specimen MNHN JL177, GenBank Acc. Number 
      KT922162) was obtained as described in Justine et al. (2015). 28S sequences of 14 
      Bipaliinae specimens and four Microplana species (outgroup) retrieved from GenBank 
      were included in the phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2). Sequence alignment was obtained 
      by using the online software MAFFT version 7 (Katoh & Standley 2013), while 
      ambiguously aligned positions were removed using the program Gblocks (Talavera & 
      Castresana 2007) with default settings, excepting the minimum number of sequences 
      for a flank position at the minimum value (set at 10) and with half of the allowed 
      gap positions. The final alignment had a length of 1589 bp. We used two phylogenetic 
      inference approaches: maximum likelihood (ML), using the RaxML 8.2.3 software 
      (Stamatakis 2014), and Bayesian inferences (BI), using MrBayes 3.2.4 (Ronquist et 
      al. 2012). The evolutionary model used, GTR+I+G, was estimated to be the best with 
      the software jModeltest 2.1.7 (Darriba et al. 2012; Guindon & Gascuel 2003), using 
      the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). MrBayes analyses were performed for 
      10-milion generation with sampling parameters every 10<sup>3</sup> and a 25% default 
      burn-in value for the final trees. Convergence of the two runs (average standard 
      deviation of split frequencies &lt;&lt; 0.01) and likelihood stationarity were 
      checked. The maximum likelihood analyses were performed under 1000 bootstrap 
      pseudoreplicates. The phylogenetic results show a close and highly supported 
      relationship of the Italian Diversibipalium specimens with those from Japan and 
      South Korea that have been identified as D. multilineatum (Fig. 2). Diversibipalium 
      multilineatum is the sister-group of B. nobile Kawakatsu & Makino, 1982, but with 
      low support. The COI sequences of the French (MNHN JL177) and the Italian 
      Diversibipalium specimens were compared in Geneious v. 8.0.5 (<a 
      href="http://www.geneious.com/">http://</a>www.geneious.com, Kearse et al. 2012) and 
      were found to be identical. These results indicate that the species introduced in 
      both countries is the same, and most probably concerns the species D. multilineatum. 
      The pathways of introduction of D. multilineatum are currently unknown, although a 
      relationship between the horticultural trade and the introduction of alien land 
      planarians is well known (Álvarez-Presas et al. 2014 and references therein). Here 
      we report the first occurrence of individuals of D. multilineatum outside Asia. The 
      GenBank sequence of D. multilineatum from South Korea is not yet supported by a 
      published description of the specimen, while it is debatable whether South Korea 
      should be considered part of the natural range of D. multilineatum, which only seems 
      to include Japan. In the present paper, we consider the South Korean animal to be an 
      introduced specimen. Soil moisture status, temperature, and food availability are 
      considered to be the main factors determining the presence of terrestrial planarians 
      (Boag et al. 1998); the microclimatic conditions of the Italian garden were similar 
      to plant nurseries and greenhouses, while an abundance of food was available, such 
      as isopods [Porcellionides pruinosus (Brandt, 1833)], oligochaetes [Dendrobaena 
      attemsi (Michaelsen, 1902) and several juveniles of Lumbricus spp.] and gastropods 
      [Cernuella cisalpina (Rossmassler, 1837), Cornu aspersum (O.F. Müller 1774), 
      Deroceras reticulatum (O.F. Müller, 1774), Discus rotundatus (O.F. Müller, 1774), 
      Limacus flavus (Linnaeus, 1758), Milax nigricans (Philippi, 1836), Papillifera 
      papillaris (Linnaeus, 1758), Pomatias elegans (O.F. Müller, 1774)]. Moreover, winter 
      2014 reached the highest temperatures and rainfall of the last two decades (source: 
      CNR-ISAC, Bologna), thus favouring establishment and spread of D. multilineatum. The 
      potential environmental impacts of some invasive flatworms are well documented 
      (Álvarez-Presas et al. 2014; Justine et al. 2014) and, even if these effects have 
      not yet been assessed for D. multilineatum, the adoption of precautionary measures 
      and of early intervention is here strongly recommended (Genovesi & Shine 2004). 
      Finally, knowledge of the introduction pathway(s), together with the analysis of 
      prey preference and possible impact on the invertebrate fauna, will be essential to 
      halt or at least to limit the spread of this introduced land flatworm.

TI  - The fate of carbon in a mature forest under carbon dioxide enrichment.
PG  - 227-231
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2128-9 [doi]
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide enrichment (eCO(2)) can enhance plant carbon uptake and 
      growth(1-5), thereby providing an important negative feedback to climate change by 
      slowing the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO(2) concentration(6). Although 
      evidence gathered from young aggrading forests has generally indicated a strong 
      CO(2) fertilization effect on biomass growth(3-5), it is unclear whether mature 
      forests respond to eCO(2) in a similar way. In mature trees and forest stands(7-10), 
      photosynthetic uptake has been found to increase under eCO(2) without any apparent 
      accompanying growth response, leaving the fate of additional carbon fixed under 
      eCO(2) unclear(4,5,7-11). Here using data from the first ecosystem-scale Free-Air 
      CO(2) Enrichment (FACE) experiment in a mature forest, we constructed a 
      comprehensive ecosystem carbon budget to track the fate of carbon as the forest 
      responded to four years of eCO(2) exposure. We show that, although the eCO(2) 
      treatment of +150 parts per million (+38 per cent) above ambient levels induced a 12 
      per cent (+247 grams of carbon per square metre per year) increase in carbon uptake 
      through gross primary production, this additional carbon uptake did not lead to 
      increased carbon sequestration at the ecosystem level. Instead, the majority of the 
      extra carbon was emitted back into the atmosphere via several respiratory fluxes, 
      with increased soil respiration alone accounting for half of the total uptake 
      surplus. Our results call into question the predominant thinking that the capacity 
      of forests to act as carbon sinks will be generally enhanced under eCO(2), and 
      challenge the efficacy of climate mitigation strategies that rely on ubiquitous 
      CO(2) fertilization as a driver of increased carbon sinks in global forests.
