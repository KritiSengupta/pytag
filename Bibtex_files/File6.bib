abstract = {The marine plastic pollution has drastic effect on marine species. The importance in environmental issues increases the demand to develop a significant technology which does not burden the marine environment or marine life forms. To mitigate the foreseen problems of micro and nanoplastic contamination, different biotechnological solutions has to be considered. Microbial communities exposed to plastic contaminated sites can adapt and form dense biofilms on the plastic surface and produce active catalytic enzymes. These enzymes can be able to degrade the synthetic polymers. In view of their high catalytic activity, microbial enzymes can be applicable for the degradation of synthetic polymers. This review highlights the toxicity of micro and nanoplastics on marine organisms, biodegradation of plastics and futuristic research needs to solve the issues of plastic pollution in marine environment.},

abstract = {The global plastics production has increased from 1.5 million tons in the 1950s to 335 million tons in 2016, with plastics discharged into virtually all components of the environment. Plastics rarely biodegrade but through different processes they fragment into microplastics and nanoplastics, which have been reported as ubiquitous pollutants in all marine environments worldwide. This study is a review of trend in marine plastic pollution with focus on the current toxicological consequences. Microplastics are capable of absorbing organic contaminants, metals and pathogens from the environment into organisms. This exacerbates its toxicological profile as they interact to induced greater toxic effects. Early studies focused on the accumulation of plastics in the marine environment, entanglement of and ingestions by marine vertebrates, with seabirds used as bioindicators. Entanglement in plastic debris increases asphyxiation through drowning, restrict feeding but increases starvation, skin abrasions and skeletal injuries. Plastic ingestion causes blockage of the guts which may cause injury of the gut lining, morbidity and mortality. Small sizes of the microplastics enhance their translocation across the gastro-intestinal membranes via endocytosis-like mechanisms and distribution into tissues and organs. While in biological systems, microplastics increase dysregulation of gene expression required for the control of oxidative stress and activating the expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf) signaling pathway in marine vertebrates and invertebrates. These alterations are responsible for microplastics induction of oxidative stress, immunological responses, genomic instability, disruption of endocrine system, neurotoxicity, reproductive abnormities, embryotoxicity and trans-generational toxicity. It is possible that the toxicological effects of microplastics will continue beyond 2020 the timeline for its ending by world environmental groups. Considering that most countries in African and Asia (major contributors of global plastic pollutions) are yet to come to terms with the enormity of microplastic pollution. Hence, majority of countries from these regions are yet to reduce, re-use or re-circle plastic materials to enhance its abatement.},

The realization that this novel substrate in the marine environment can facilitate microbial dispersal and affect all aquatic ecosystems has intensified interest in the microbial ecology and evolution of this biotope. Whether a ‘core' plastisphere community exists that is specific to plastic is currently a topic of intense investigation.

abstract = {Plastic polymers with different properties have been developed in the last 150 years to replace materials such as wood, glass and metals across various applications. Nevertheless, the distinct properties which make plastic desirable for our daily use also threaten our planet's sustainability. Plastics are resilient, non-reactive and most importantly, non-biodegradable. Hence, there has been an exponential increase in plastic waste generation, which has since been recognised as a global environmental threat. Plastic wastes have adversely affected life on earth, primarily through their undesirable accumulation in landfills, leaching into the soil, increased greenhouse gas emission, etc. Even more damaging is their impact on the aquatic ecosystems as they cause entanglement, ingestion and intestinal blockage in aquatic animals. Furthermore, plastics, especially in the microplastic form, have also been found to interfere with chemical interaction between marine organisms, to cause intrinsic toxicity by leaching, and by absorbing persistent organic contaminants as well as pathogens. The current methods for eliminating these wastes (incineration, landfilling, and recycling) come at massive costs, are unsustainable, and put more burden on our environment. Thus, recent focus has been placed more on the potential of biological systems to degrade synthetic plastics. In this regard, some insects, bacteria and fungi have been shown to ingest these polymers and convert them into environmentally friendly carbon compounds. Hence, in the light of recent literature, this review emphasises the multifaceted roles played by microorganisms in this process. The current understanding of the roles played by actinomycetes, algae, bacteria, fungi and their enzymes in enhancing the degradation of synthetic plastics are reviewed, with special focus on their modes of action and probable enzymatic mechanisms. Besides, key areas for further exploration, such as the manipulation of microorganisms through molecular cloning, modification of enzymatic characteristics and metabolic pathway design, are also highlighted.},

abstract = {Plastic pollution is prevalent worldwide and affects marine wildlife from urbanized beaches to pristine oceanic islands. However, the ecological basis and mechanisms that result in marine animal ingestion of plastic debris are still relatively unknown, despite recent advances. We investigated the relationship between scavenging behavior and plastic ingestion using green turtles, Chelonia mydas, as a model. Diet analysis of C. mydas showed that sea turtles engaging in scavenging behavior ingested significantly more plastic debris than individuals that did not engage in this foraging strategy. We argue that opportunistic scavenging behavior, an adaptive behavior in most marine ecosystems, may now pose a threat to a variety of marine animals due to the current widespread plastic pollution found in oceans. Scavenging behavior in sea turtles led to high rates and loads of plastic ingestion and may be an important pathway for plastic debris ingestion by marine animals.},

abstract = {This review discusses the mechanisms of generation and potential impacts of microplastics in the ocean environment. Weathering degradation of plastics on the beaches results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that are carried into water by wind or wave action. Unlike inorganic fines present in sea water, microplastics concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by partition. The relevant distribution coefficients for common POPs are several orders of magnitude in favour of the plastic medium. Consequently, the microparticles laden with high levels of POPs can be ingested by marine biota. Bioavailability and the efficiency of transfer of the ingested POPs across trophic levels are not known and the potential damage posed by these to the marine ecosystem has yet to be quantified and modelled. Given the increasing levels of plastic pollution of the oceans it is important to better understand the impact of microplastics in the ocean food web. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first invading microbes on plastics in 4 different aquatic communities including seawater, freshwater, marine sediments and lake sediments were developed in microcosm incubation experiments. A mixture of weathered plastics (PE, PS, PET) was incubated with different indigenous communities under their respective habitat simulations. All microbial communities were able to form populations on all plastic surfaces with time-dependent development. Biofilm also affected floatation of plastics and the communities on PE foam (PF) were dominated by genera affiliated with plastic and hydrocarbon degraders. The results showed that indigenous populations were able to degrade plastic pieces and utilize them as carbon sources where the weight of PF was reduced more effectively than PS and PET. Besides, carbonyl groups that were seen with FTIR on initial PF disappeared after microbial treatment along with signs of bioerosion on the plastic surface.},

abstract = {Plastic pollution is entering the world's oceans at alarming rates and is expected to outweigh fish populations by 2050. This plastic waste originates from land-based applications, like consumer product packaging, and is composed of high-durability polyolefins. These conventional plastics possess desirable properties, including high chemical stability, moisture barrier, and thermoplastic characteristics. Unfortunately, if these materials reach marine environments, they fragment into microplastics that cannot be biologically assimilated. The aim of this review is to investigate commercial polymers that are biodegradable in marine environments but have comparable product stability and moisture barrier properties to polyolefins. Among commercially available biopolymers, thermoplastic starches (TPS) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been shown to biodegrade in marine environments. Moreover, these biopolymers are thermoplastics and possess similar thermoforming properties to polyolefins. At present, TPS and PHAs have limitations, including chemical instability, limited moisture barrier properties, and high production costs. To replace conventional polymers with PHAs and TPS, these properties must be improved.},

Although PE is not biodegradable, in coastal areas it fragments into microplastics (MP) readily taken up by biota, and have been postulated as vectors of hydrophobic chemicals to marine organisms. We have tested this hypothesis using two organisms representative of the marine plankton, the holoplanktonic copepod Acartia clausi, and the meroplanktonic larva of the Paracentrotus lividus sea-urchin, and two model chemicals with similar hydrophobic properties, the 4-n-Nonylphenol and the 4-Methylbenzylidene-camphor used as plastic additive and UV filter in cosmetics. Both test species actively ingested the MP particles. However, the presence of MP never increased the bioaccumulation of neither model chemicals, nor their toxicity to the exposed organisms. Bioaccumulation was a linear function of waterborne chemical disregarding the level of MP. Toxicity, assessed by the threshold (EC10) and median (EC50) effect levels, was either independent of the level of MP or even in some instances significantly decreased in the presence of MPs. These consistent results challenge the assumption that MP act as vectors of hydrophobic chemicals to planktonic marine organisms.},

Using marine organisms as bioindicators of plastic pollution can provide crucial information that would better integrate the spatial and temporal presence of plastic debris in the sea. Given their long and frequent migrations, numerous marine species that ingest plastics can provide information on the presence of plastic debris but only on large spatial and temporal scales, thus making it difficult to identify quantitative correlations of ingested plastics within well-defined spatio-temporal patterns. Given the complex dynamics of plastics in the sea, the biomonitoring of marine plastic debris should rely on the combination of several bioindicator species with different characteristics that complement each other. Other critical aspects include the standardization of sampling protocols, analytical detection methods and metrics to evaluate the effects of ingested plastics in marine species.},

abstract = {Microplastics are abundant and widespread in the marine environment. They are a contaminant of global environmental and economic concern. Due to their small size a wide range of marine species, including zooplankton can ingest them. Research has shown that microplastics are readily ingested by several zooplankton taxa, with associated negative impacts on biological processes. Zooplankton is a crucial food source for many secondary consumers, consequently this represents a route whereby microplastic could enter the food web and transfer up the trophic levels. In this review we aim to: 1) evaluate the current knowledge base regarding microplastic ingestion by zooplankton in both the laboratory and the field; and 2) summarise the factors which contribute to the bioavailability of microplastics to zooplankton. Current literature shows that microplastic ingestion has been recorded in 39 zooplankton species from 28 taxonomic orders including holo- and meroplanktonic species. The majority of studies occurred under laboratory conditions and negative effects were reported in ten studies (45%) demonstrating effects on feeding behaviour, growth, development, reproduction and lifespan. In contrast, three studies (14%) reported no negative effects from microplastic ingestion. Several physical and biological factors can influence the bioavailability of microplastics to zooplankton, such as size, shape, age and abundance. We identified that microplastics used in experiments are often different to those quantified in the marine environment, particularly in terms of concentration, shape, type and age. We therefore suggest that future research should include microplastics that are more representative of those found in the marine environment at relevant concentrations. Additionally, investigating the effects of microplastic ingestion on a broader range of zooplankton species and life stages, will help to answer key knowledge gaps regarding the effect of microplastic on recruitment, species populations and ultimately broader economic consequences such as impacts on shell- and finfish stocks. Review of the current knowledge regarding microplastic ingestion by zooplankton and summary of factors which contribute to the bioavailability of microplastics to zooplankton.},

Among several actions, legal and technological, undertaken to alleviate this problem, included are the control of single use conventional plastics and the replacement of conventional non-biodegradable plastics with innovative biodegradable-in-the-sea polymers, both aiming at the mitigation of marine litter accumulation. Laboratory tests have been used to characterize plastics regarding their biodegradation in various environments. Biodegradation of plastics depends on the inherent characteristics of the polymer and the particular marine habitat conditions. In the present work, the international standard test method ISO 19679 (2016) for determining the aerobic biodegradation of non-floating plastic materials in a seawater-sediment interface of the coastal marine zone under laboratory simulated conditions is evaluated. Modifications are proposed to improve the reliability of this test method in some aspects. Agitation of the seawater surface in the bioreactor was found to enhance the continuous availability of oxygen at the seawater-sediment interface, thus assuring aerobic biodegradation conditions throughout the test simulating real sublittoral conditions. Additional recommended improvements include the use of larger samples and supplementary nutrients to optimise biodegradation conditions. The laboratory measurements were validated by field experiments. The proposed modifications and refinements optimise the robustness and reliability of the test method for determining aerobic biodegradation of plastic materials in a simulated seawater-sediment interface of the coastal zone.},

abstract = {Plastics are the most abundant marine debris globally dispersed in the oceans and its production is rising with documented negative impacts in marine ecosystems. However, the chemical-physical and biological interactions occurring between plastic and planktonic communities of different types of microorganisms are poorly understood. In these respects, it is of paramount importance to understand, on a molecular level on the surface, what happens to plastic fragments when dispersed in the ocean and directly interacting with phytoplankton assemblages. This study presents a computer-aided analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of selected spin probes able to enter the phyoplanktonic cell interface and interact with the plastic surface. Two different marine phytoplankton species were analyzed, such as the diatom Skeletonema marinoi and dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum, in absence and presence of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fragments in synthetic seawater (ASPM), in order to in-situ characterize the interactions occurring between the microalgal cells and plastic surfaces. The analysis was performed at increasing incubation times. The cellular growth and adhesion rates of microalgae in batch culture medium and on the plastic fragments were also evaluated. The data agreed with the EPR results, which showed a significant difference in terms of surface properties between the diatom and dinoflagellate species. Low-polar interactions of lipid aggregates with the plastic surface sites were mainly responsible for the cell-plastic adhesion by S. marinoi, which is exponentially growing on the plastic surface over the incubation time.},

abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) and mesoplastics are able to sorb harmful substances and often contain additives, e.g., endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), that can cause adverse effects to organisms. The present study aims to determine EDC concentrations and their endocrine activities in leachates of field-collected marine MPs and mesoplastics under stress conditions that are known to occur during the plastic life cycle. Estrogens were the dominant EDCs on plastic particles and were either concentrated from the surrounding water or originated from plastic manufacturing. Bisphenol A had the highest detection frequency (75%) with an average concentration of 475 ± 882 $\mu$g/kg, followed by bisphenol S, octylphenol and nonylphenol. Moreover, smaller marine MPs leached greater quantities of EDCs because the sorption from surrounding seawater is more efficient for smaller particles. It was found that normal life stresses such as microwaving (MW) and autoclaving (AC) can decrease EDC concentrations, but solar irradiation (solar) can increase EDC concentrations in leachates. Even though organisms with higher metabolic ability exhibited greater estrogenic effects, the comprehensive toxicity of plastic leachates after common life treatments was still limited (below the EC10 value) if 0.1% is taken as the EDC uptake from plastic. In future studies, the accurate contribution of plastic bound EDCs needs to be further explored, and the monitoring of MPs and mesoplastics in the human diet remains important because the concentrations of these plastics may change in the future.},

In this study, we investigated the ingestion, bioaccumulation and egestion of fluorescent polystyrene (PS)micospheres (10 $\mu$m)in both larvae and adults of marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), with or without food supply. The post-exposure effects of non-fluorescent PS (10 $\mu$m)on the survival, growth and reproduction of medaka larvae were also explored. Results showed that the PS microspheres could be ingested by both larvae and adults during the 48 h-exposure. Notably, feeding status was found to significantly affect the ingestion in medaka adults, which was not observed in the larvae. The egestion process of PS was rapid during the first recovery day but there was still certain percent of particles retained in digestive tracts at the end of 7 d recovery for either larvae or adults. After a 14 d pre-exposure with the non-fluorescent PS microspheres, the subsequent survival, growth and reproduction of medaka larvae were all significantly affected at the end of 120 d of experiment without PS. Overall, these results indicate that fishes might ingest or retain more MPs if the environmental abundance of MPs continues to increase while the available food decreases. Medaka fishes in larval stage have no capacity to select natural food sources like the adults. The chronic and “legacy effect” of MPs might also be a problem worthy paid more attention in future research instead of acute and immediate effect studies.},

abstract = {Plastics are widely used in the global economy, and each year, at least 350 to 400 million tons are being produced. Due to poor recycling and low circular use, millions of tons accumulate annually in terrestrial or marine environments. Today it has become clear that plastic causes adverse effects in all ecosystems and that microplastics are of particular concern to our health. Therefore, recent microbial research has addressed the question of if and to what extent microorganisms can degrade plastics in the environment. This review summarizes current knowledge on microbial plastic degradation. Enzymes available act mainly on the high-molecularweight polymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ester-based polyurethane (PUR). Unfortunately, the best PUR- and PET-active enzymes and microorganisms known still have moderate turnover rates. While many reports describing microbial communities degrading chemical additives have been published, no enzymes acting on the high-molecular-weight polymers polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, ether-based polyurethane, and polyethylene are known. Together, these polymers comprise more than 80% of annual plastic production. Thus, further research is needed to significantly increase the diversity of enzymes and microorganisms acting on these polymers. This can be achieved by tapping into the global metagenomes of noncultivated microorganisms and dark matter proteins. Only then can novel biocatalysts and organisms be delivered that allow rapid degradation, recycling, or value-added use of the vast majority of most human-made polymers.},

abstract = {Despite growing evidence that biofilm formation on plastic debris in the marine environment may be essential for its biodegradation, the underlying processes have yet to be fully understood. Thus, far, bacterial biofilm formation had only been studied after short-term exposure or on floating plastic, yet a prominent share of plastic litter accumulates on the seafloor. In this study, we explored the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities on polyethylene plastic sheets and dolly ropes during long-term exposure on the seafloor, both at a harbor and an offshore location in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We reconstructed the sequence of events during biofilm formation on plastic in the harbor environment and identified a core bacteriome and subsets of bacterial indicator species for early, intermediate, and late stages of biofilm formation. Additionally, by implementing ITS2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, we identified and characterized for the first time fungal genera on plastic debris. Surprisingly, none of the plastics exposed to offshore conditions displayed the typical signature of a late stage biofilm, suggesting that biofilm formation is severely hampered in the natural environment where most plastic debris accumulates.},

abstract = {Biodegradable and compostable plastics are getting more attention as the environmental impacts of fossil-fuel-based plastics are revealed. Microbes can consume these plastics and biodegrade them within weeks to months under the proper conditions. The biobased polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymer family is an attractive alternative due to its physicochemical properties and biodegradability in soil, aquatic, and composting environments. Standard test methods are available for biodegradation that employ either natural inocula or defined communities, the latter being preferred for standardization and comparability. The original marine biodegradation standard test method ASTM D6691 employed such a defined consortium for testing PHA biodegradation. However, the taxonomic composition and metabolic potential of this consortium have never been confirmed using DNA sequencing technologies. To this end, we revived available members of this consortium and determined their phylogenetic placement, genomic sequence content, and metabolic potential. The revived members belonged to the Bacillaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Vibrionaceae families. Using a comparative genomics approach, we found all the necessary enzymes for both PHA production and utilization in most of the members. In a clearing-zone assay, three isolates also showed extracellular depolymerase activity. However, we did not find classical PHA depolymerases, but identified two potentially new extracellular depolymerases that resemble triacylglycerol lipases.},

abstract = {Pollution of aquatic ecosystems by plastic wastes poses severe environmental and health problems and has prompted scientific investigations on the fate and factors contributing to the modification of plastics in the marine environment. Here, we investigated, by means of microcosm studies, the role of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), the main constituents of plastic bottles, in the marine environment. To this aim, different bacterial consortia, previously acclimated to representative hydrocarbons fractions namely, tetradecane (aliphatic fraction), diesel (mixture of hydrocarbons), and naphthalene/phenantrene (aromatic fraction), were used as inocula of microcosm experiments, in order to identify peculiar specialization in poly(ethylene terephthalate) degradation. Upon formation of a mature biofilm on the surface of poly(ethylene terephthalate) films, the bacterial biodiversity and degradation efficiency of each selected consortium was analyzed. Notably, significant differences on biofilm biodiversity were observed with distinctive hydrocarbons-degraders being enriched on poly(ethylene terephthalate) surface, such as Alcanivorax, Hyphomonas, and Cycloclasticus species. Interestingly, ATR-FTIR analyses, supported by SEM and water contact angle measurements, revealed major alterations of the surface chemistry and morphology of PET films, mainly driven by the bacterial consortia enriched on tetradecane and diesel. Distinctive signatures of microbial activity were the alteration of the FTIR spectra as a consequence of PET chain scission through the hydrolysis of the ester bond, the increased sample hydrophobicity as well as the formation of small cracks and cavities on the surface of the film. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that hydrocarbons-degrading marine bacteria have the potential to degrade poly(ethylene terephthalate), although their degradative activity could potentially trigger the formation of harmful microplastics in the marine environment.},

Here we used fluorescent and pristine polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) particles with two diameters (5 $\mu$m and 20 $\mu$m) to investigate the tissue distribution, accumulation, and tissue-specific health risk of MPs in mice. Results indicated that MPs accumulated in liver, kidney and gut, with a tissue-accumulation kinetics and distribution pattern that was strongly depended on the MPs particle size. In addition, analyses of multiple biochemical biomarkers and metabolomic profiles suggested that MPs exposure induced disturbance of energy and lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress. Interestingly, blood biomarkers of neurotoxicity were also altered. Our results uncovered the distribution and accumulation of MPs across mice tissues and revealed significant alteration in several biomarkers that indicate potential toxicity from MPs exposure. Collectively, our data provided new evidence for the adverse consequences of MPs.},

abstract = {Plastics have become strong environmental stressors of coastal marine ecosystems. Their introduction into the marine ecosystem is subjected to different mechanisms, including the inadequate disposal of solid waste and dumping of wastewater. In addition, their chemical composition makes them resistant to variables such as temperature and salinity of water. These polymers are degraded and fragmented mainly due to the action of the waves, which results in the formation of smaller particles called microplastics. Microplastics are characterized by being persistent in the environment due to their low biodegradation, and although they have a maximum size of 5 mm, there is a wide range of sizes suggested by different authors. According to their use, microplastics can be classified as primary when they are recognized at first sight, and as secondary, when they are gradually divided. Microplastics have become a potential risk to the health of marine species due to their small size, and the risk to human health due to their persistence through trophic chains is alarming. Given the potential impact these materials would have in the biota, and the need to assist the different regulatory agencies to develop political acts on the proper management and disposal of microplastics, the aim of this work was to identify different research carried out at international level on established methodologies for studies of identification and quantification of microplastics, bacterial communities, and contaminants adhered to microparticles. Given the above, some methodologies have been identified and used in various studies for the identification and quantification of these materials on beaches. It should be noted that in different countries, there has been an increase in research related to contamination by microplastics on beaches, in which bacterial communities attached to these plastic particles have been also identified. Likewise, not only the risks and threats have been determined for marine species but also for the health of people who frequent tourist places such as beaches.},

This provides the clarification required as to what ‘marine biodegradation of PHA' means in practicality and allows the risks and benefits of using PHA to be transparently discussed.

Recent studies have shown that MPs, of which the predominant type is often polystyrene (PS; known as PS-MPs), can extend to and affect remote, sparsely inhabited areas via atmospheric transport. Although exposure to inhaled MPs may induce lung dysfunction, further experimental verification of the pulmonary toxic potential of MPs and the mechanism underlying the toxicity is needed. Here we used normal human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells to clarify the association between pulmonary toxicity and PS-MPs. Results revealed that PS-MPs can cause cytotoxic and inflammatory effects in BEAS-2B cells by inducing reactive oxygen species formation. PS-MPs can decrease transepithelial electrical resistance by depleting zonula occludens proteins. Indeed, decreased $\alpha$1-antitrypsin levels in BEAS-2B cells suggest that exposure to PS-MPs increases the risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and high concentrations of PS-MPs can induce these adverse responses. While low PS-MP levels can only disrupt the protective pulmonary barrier, they may also increase the risk for lung disease. Collectively, our findings indicate that PS-MP inhalation may influence human respiratory health.},

Understanding biofouling mechanisms is a key issue to assessing the ecological impacts and fate of plastics in marine environment. In this study, we investigated the different steps of plastic colonization of polyolefin-based plastics, on the first one hand, including conventional low-density polyethylene (PE), additivated PE with pro-oxidant (OXO), and artificially aged OXO (AA-OXO); and of a polyester, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV), on the other hand. We combined measurements of physical surface properties of polymers (hydrophobicity and roughness) with microbiological characterization of the biofilm (cell counts, taxonomic composition, and heterotrophic activity) using a wide range of techniques, with some of them used for the first time on plastics. Our experimental setup using aquariums with natural circulating seawater during 6 weeks allowed us to characterize the successive phases of primo-colonization, growing, and maturation of the biofilms. We highlighted different trends between polymer types with distinct surface properties and composition, the biodegradable AA-OXO and PHBV presenting higher colonization by active and specific bacteria compared to non-biodegradable polymers (PE and OXO). Succession of bacterial population occurred during the three colonization phases, with hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria being highly abundant on all plastic types. This study brings original data that provide new insights on the colonization of non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymers by marine microorganisms.},

abstract = {The production of biodegradable plastic is increasing. Given the augmented littering of these products an increasing input into the sea is expected. Previous laboratory experiments have shown that degradation of plastic starts within days to weeks. Little is known about the early composition and activity of biofilms found on biodegradable and conventional plastic debris and its correlation to degradation in the marine environment. In this study we investigated the early formation of biofilms on plastic shopper bags and its consequences for the degradation of plastic. Samples of polyethylene and biodegradable plastic were tested in the Mediterranean Sea for 15 and 33 days. The samples were distributed equally to a shallow benthic (sedimentary seafloor at 6 m water depth) and a pelagic habitat (3 m water depth) to compare the impact of these different environments on fouling and degradation. The amount of biofilm increased on both plastic types and in both habitats. The diatom abundance and diversity differed significantly between the habitats and the plastic types. Diatoms were more abundant on samples from the pelagic zone. We anticipate that specific surface properties of the polymer types induced different biofilm communities on both plastic types. Additionally, different environmental conditions between the benthic and pelagic experimental site such as light intensity and shear forces may have influenced unequal colonisation between these habitats. The oxygen production rate was negative for all samples, indicating that the initial biofilm on marine plastic litter consumes oxygen, regardless of the plastic type or if exposed in the pelagic or the benthic zone. Mechanical tests did not reveal degradation within one month of exposure. However, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis displayed potential signs of degradation on the plastic surface, which differed between both plastic types. This study indicates that the early biofilm formation and composition are affected by the plastic type and habitat. Further, it reveals that already within two weeks biodegradable plastic shows signs of degradation in the benthic and pelagic habitat.},

PHAs are produced by high density fed-batch cultivation, activated sludge, microbial consortia and continuous substrate supply, and a major cost associated with their production is the carbon source used for bacterial fermentation. Therefore, novel carbon sources have been studied for PHA production including, macro algae, peanut oil, crude glycerol and whey.

abstract = {Marine debris, especially plastic debris, is widely recognized as a global environmental problem. There has been substantial research on the impacts of plastic marine debris, such as entanglement and ingestion. These impacts are largely due to the physical presence of plastic debris. In recent years there has been an increasing focus on the impacts of toxic chemicals as they relate to plastic debris. Some plastic debris acts as a source of toxic chemicals: substances that were added to the plastic during manufacturing leach from plastic debris. Plastic debris also acts as a sink for toxic chemicals. Plastic sorbs persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances (PBTs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, from the water or sediment. These PBTs may desorb when the plastic is ingested by any of a variety of marine species. This broad look at the current research suggests that while there is significant uncertainty and complexity in the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction, plastic debris appears to act as a vector transferring PBTs from the water to the food web, increasing risk throughout the marine food web, including humans. Because of the extremely long lifetime of plastic and PBTs in the ocean, prevention strategies are vital to minimizing these risks. {\textcopyright} This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

MNPs negatively affected growth of microalgae but usually had a high EC50 (> 25 mg/L). However, positively charged MNPs had a much lower EC50 (< 1 mg/L). MNPs lowered maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) with the effect increasing with concentration of MNPs but diminishing with exposure time, and also reduced chlorophyll a content to enhanced extent with increased MNPs concentration. MNPs induced relatively higher changes in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in marine algae than in freshwater algae. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels increased with MNPs concentration and exposure time while SOD levels first increased and then decreased with increasing MNPs concentration. Macrophytes were found to be able to trap MNPs via multiple mechanisms.

When singly existed, DEP was degraded more quickly than in a mixture with DBP, indicating that DBP had inhibitory effect on the biodegradation of DEP.

However, to integrate results produced by different monitoring techniques and consider the photographic method a viable alternative, this ‘new' methodology must be validated. This study aims to compare observations obtained from the concurrent application of observer-based and photographic methods during aerial surveys. To do so, a Partenavia P-68 aircraft equipped with an RGB sensor was used to monitor the waters off the Spanish Mediterranean coast along 12 transects (941 km). Over 10000 images were collected and checked manually by a photo-interpreter to detect potential targets, which were classified as floating marine macro-litter, mega-fauna and seabirds. The two methods allowed the detection of items from the three categories and proved equally effective for the detection of cetaceans, sea turtles and large fish on the sea surface. However, the photographic method was more effective for floating litter detection and the observer-based method was more effective for seabird detection. These results provide the first validation of the use of aerial photography to monitor floating litter and mega-fauna over the marine surface.},

abstract = {Each year vast amounts of plastic are produced worldwide. When released to the environment, plastics accumulate, and plastic debris in the world's oceans is of particular environmental concern. More than 60% of all floating debris in the oceans is plastic and amounts are increasing each year. Plastic polymers in the marine environment are exposed to sunlight, oxidants and physical stress, and over time they weather and degrade. The degradation processes and products must be understood to detect and evaluate potential environmental hazards. Some attention has been drawn to additives and persistent organic pollutants that sorb to the plastic surface, but so far the chemicals generated by degradation of the plastic polymers themselves have not been well studied from an environmental perspective. In this paper we review available information about the degradation pathways and chemicals that are formed by degradation of the six plastic types that are most widely used in Europe. We extrapolate that information to likely pathways and possible degradation products under environmental conditions found on the oceans' surface. The potential degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type. UV-radiation and oxygen are the most important factors that initiate degradation of polymers with a carbon-carbon backbone, leading to chain scission. Smaller polymer fragments formed by chain scission are more susceptible to biodegradation and therefore abiotic degradation is expected to precede biodegradation. When heteroatoms are present in the main chain of a polymer, degradation proceeds by photo-oxidation, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. Degradation of plastic polymers can lead to low molecular weight polymer fragments, like monomers and oligomers, and formation of new end groups, especially carboxylic acids.},

After 7 months, three microcosms showed dense biofilms on plastic surfaces, gravimetric weight losses up to 11.7 ± 0.6%, marked decreases in thermal stability and average molecular weight of the polymer, suggesting microbial attack towards polymer chains.

abstract = {Knowledge of biofilm formation on pollutants in the marine realm is expanding, but how communities respond to substrates during colonization remains poorly understood. Here, we assess community assembly and respiration in response to two different micropollutants, virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microbeads and textile fibres under different light settings. Raman characterization, high-throughput DNA sequencing data, quantitative PCR, and respiration measurements reveal how a stimulation of aerobic respiration by micropollutants is translated into selection for significantly different communities colonizing the substrates. Despite the lack of evidence for biodegradation of HDPE, an increased abundance and respiration of bacterial taxa closely related to hydrocarbonoclastic Kordiimonas spp. and Alteromonas spp. in the presence of textile waste highlights their biodegradation potential. Incubations with textile fibres exhibited significantly higher respiration rates in the presence of light, which could be partially explained by photochemical dissolution of the textile waste into smaller bioavailable compounds. Our results suggest that the development and increased respiration of these unique microbial communities may potentially play a role in the bioremediation of the relatively long-lived textile pollutants in marine habitats, and that the respiration of heterotrophic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria colonizing marine pollutants can be stimulated by light.},

abstract = {The accumulation of plastic debris is a global environmental problem due to its durability, persistence, and abundance. Although effects of plastic debris on individual marine organisms, particularly mammals and birds, have been extensively documented (e.g., entanglement and choking), very little is known about effects on assemblages and consequences for ecosystem functioning. In Europe, around 40% of the plastic items produced are utilized as single-use packaging, which rapidly accumulate in waste management facilities and as litter in the environment. A range of biodegradable plastics have been developed with the aspiration of reducing the persistence of litter; however, their impacts on marine assemblages or ecosystem functioning have never been evaluated. A field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of conventional and biodegradable plastic carrier bags as litter on benthic macro- and meio-faunal assemblages and biogeochemical processes (primary productivity, redox condition, organic matter content, and pore-water nutrients) on an intertidal shore near Dublin, Ireland. After 9 weeks, the presence of either type of bag created anoxic conditions within the sediment along with reduced primary productivity and organic matter and significantly lower abundances of infaunal invertebrates. This indicates that both conventional and biodegradable bags can rapidly alter marine assemblages and the ecosystem services they provide.},

To mitigate the adverse societal and ecological impacts of this waste, there has been debate on whether ‘biodegradable' materials should be granted exemptions from plastic bag bans and levies. However, great care must be exercised when attempting to define this term, due to the broad and complex range of physical and chemical conditions encountered within natural ecosystems. Here, we review existing international industry standards and regional test methods for evaluating the biodegradability of plastics within aquatic environments (wastewater, unmanaged freshwater and marine habitats). We argue that current standards and test methods are insufficient in their ability to realistically predict the biodegradability of carrier bags in these environments, due to several shortcomings in experimental procedures and a paucity of information in the scientific literature. Moreover, existing biodegradability standards and test methods for aquatic environments do not involve toxicity testing or account for the potentially adverse ecological impacts of carrier bags, plastic additives, polymer degradation products or small (microscopic) plastic particles that can arise via fragmentation. Successfully addressing these knowledge gaps is a key requirement for developing new biodegradability standard(s) for lightweight carrier bags.},

The maximum biofilm formation of V. harveyi was obtained overnight with SBB and PE, and after 3 days with PLA.

Here we examine ingestion and shredding of plastic carrier bags by Orchestia gammarellus. A laboratory experiment showed these amphipods shredded plastic carrier bags, generating numerous microplastic fragments (average diameter 488.59 $\mu$m). The presence of a biofilm significantly increased the amount of shredding, but plastic type (conventional, degradable and biodegradable) had no effect. Subsequent field observations confirmed similar shredding occurred on the strandline.

Over the past decade, a broad range of laboratory and experimental studies have complemented field observations in the hope of achieving a better understanding of the fate and impact of micro- and/or nanoplastics (MP/NP) on diverse organisms (e.g., birds, fish, and mammals). However, plastic pollution remains challenging to monitor in the environment and to control under laboratory conditions, and plastic particles are often naturally or experimentally co-contaminated with diverse chemical pollutants. Therefore, our understanding of the effects of virgin MP/NP in freshwater and marine fish is still limited. Here, we performed a systematic review of the most up-to-date literature on the effects of virgin MP/NP on fish under laboratory conditions. A total of 782 biological endpoints investigated in 46 studies were extracted. Among these endpoints, 32% were significantly affected by exposure to virgin MP/NP. More effects were observed for smaller plastic particles (i.e., size ≤20 $\mu$m), affecting fish behavioral and neurological functions, intestinal permeability, metabolism, and intestinal microbiome diversity. In addition, we propose suggestions for new research directions to lead toward innovative, robust, and scientifically sound experiments in this field. This review of experimental studies reveals that the toxicity of virgin MP/NP on fish should be more systematically evaluated using rigorous laboratory-based methods and aims toward a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this toxicity to fish.},

A growing literature has focused on the microbial life growing on the surfaces of these pollutants called the “plastisphere,” but the general concepts of microbial ecotoxicology have only rarely been integrated. Microbial ecotoxicology deals with (i) the impact of pollutants on microbial communities and inversely (ii) how much microbes can influence their biodegradation. The goal of this review is to enlighten the growing literature of the last 15 years on microbial ecotoxicology related to plastic pollution in the oceans. First, we focus on the impact of plastic on marine microbial life and on the various functions it ensures in the ecosystems. In this part, we also discuss the driving factors influencing biofilm development on plastic surfaces and the potential role of plastic debris as vector for dispersal of harmful pathogen species. Second, we give a critical view of the extent to which marine microorganisms can participate in the decomposition of plastic in the oceans and of the relevance of current standard tests for plastic biodegradability at sea. We highlight some examples of metabolic pathways of polymer biodegradation. We conclude with several questions regarding gaps in current knowledge of plastic biodegradation by marine microorganisms and the identification of possible directions for future research.},

The color (J = 0.65–0.68) of items ingested by both species, and the type ingested by wedge-tailed shearwaters (J = 0.85–0.87), overlapped with plastic available in the local environment indicating moderate selection for plastic color and type.

Many terrestrial and marine-based processes, including domestic and industrial drainage, maritime activities agricultural runoff and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent, contribute to MP pollution in aquatic environments.

Both diatom (Nitzschia sp.4) and bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) were exposed with substrates separately for 30 days.

This study attempted to identify the substrates that adhere to diatoms strongly and was mainly analyzed by scanning electron microscope and further the observations are well supported by math work software (MATLAB). The variation of diatom's binding on different substrates is due to the influence of marine litters on diatom population in ocean beds where they undergo slow degradation releasing macro, micro and nanoparticles besides radicals and ions causing cell death. Therefore a proof-of-concept model is developed to successfully deliver a message concerning benefit of using different diatom species.},

These bacterial isolates H-237, H-255, H-256 and H-265 were revealed close similarity with Cobetia sp., Halomonas sp., Exigobacterium sp. and Alcanivorax sp., respectively based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. These bacterial isolates were individually incubated for 90 days supplied with LDPE films as a carbon source using the Bushnell-Haas medium. During the biodegradation assay, bacterial isolates were formed the viable biofilm on the LDPE surface, which decreased the thermal stability of the films. At the end of the incubation study, a maximum weight loss of 1.72% of LDPE film was observed by the bacterial isolate H-255. The bacterial attachment on the film changed the physical structure (surface erosion, roughness and degradation) which were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The changes in the chemical structure of the LDPE film were analyzed by Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). This ATR-FTIR showed the shifting of peaks of C–H stretch and C=C bond stretching and the new peaks formation of C–O and –C=C– bonds in comparison to control LDPE film. Further, biodegradation of LDPE film was also confirmed by remineralization of carbon and enzymatic activities. This study revealed that the active biodegradation of LDPE film by marine bacteria and these bacteria could reduce plastic pollution in the marine environment.},

Furthermore, contaminant background, food availability, species, developmental stage and sex have major influence on the outcome of plastic particles exposures. Frequently reported effects were on body and population growth, energy metabolism, feeding, movement activity, physiological stress, oxidative stress, inflammation, the immune system, hormonal regulation, aberrant development, cell death, general toxicity and altered lipid metabolism. Several times reported were increased growth and food consumption, neuro-, liver- or kidney pathology and intestinal damage.

We studied the bacterial adherence, degradation and destabilization of polyvinylchloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) by marine bacterial strain AIIW2 by a series of analytical and microscopic observations over 3 months. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence and the phylogenetic analysis of the strain AIIW2, it showed 97.39% similarity with Bacillus species. Degradation of plastics was determined by the weight loss after 90 days with bacterial strain which detected up to 0.26 ± 0.02, 0.96 ± 0.02, and 1.0 ± 0.01% for PVC, LDPE, and HDPE films, respectively over initial weights. The mineralization of plastic film was found to be maximum in LDPE followed by HDPE and PVC. Bacterial interaction had increased roughness and deteriorated the surface of plastics which is revealed by the scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. Bending vibrations of the alkane rock chain (–CH 2 and –CH 3 ) and carbonyl (–CO) regions in LDPE and HDPE films, while there was slight stretching in the hydroxyl (–OH) regions of carboxylic acid in PVC which is evidenced through Fourier transform infrared spectral studies, suggested the oxidative activities of the bacteria. Though, the bacterial activity was higher on the LDPE and HDPE than PVC film which may be due to the presence of chlorine atom in PVC structure making it more versatile. The results of the present study revealed the ability of marine bacterial strain for instigating their colonization over plastic films and deteriorating the polymeric structure.},

The fate of these materials in the environment and their possible effects on organisms and ecosystems has rarely been studied systematically and is not well understood. For the marine environment, reliable field test methods and standards for assessing and certifying biodegradation to bridge laboratory respirometric data are lacking. In this work we present newly developed field tests to assess the performance of (biodegradable) plastics under natural marine conditions. These methods were successfully applied and validated in three coastal habitats (eulittoral, benthic and pelagic) and two climate zones (Mediterranean Sea and tropical Southeast Asia). Additionally, a stand-alone mesocosm test system which integrated all three habitats in one technical system at 400-L scale independent from running seawater is presented as a methodological bridge. Films of polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer (PHA) and low density polyethylene (LD-PE) were used to validate the tests. While LD-PE remained intact, PHA disintegrated to a varying degree depending on the habitat and the climate zone. Together with the existing laboratory standard test methods, the field and mesocosm test systems presented in this work provide a 3-tier testing scheme for the reliable assessment of the biodegradation of (biodegradable) plastic in the marine environment. This toolset of tests can be adapted to other aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Plastics are widely used due to their excellent properties, inexpensiveness and versatility leading to an exponential consumption growth during the last decades. However, most plastic does not biodegrade in any meaningful sense; it can exist for hundreds of years. Only a small percentage of plastic waste is recycled, the rest being dumped in landfills, incinerated or simply not collected. Waste-water treatment plants can only minimize the problem by trapping plastic particles of larger size and some smaller ones remain within oxidation ponds or sewage sludge, but a large amount of microplastics still contaminate water streams and marine systems. Thus, it is clear that in order to tackle this potential ecological disaster, new strategies are necessary. This review aims at briefly introducing the microplastics threat and critically discusses emerging technologies, which are capable to efficiently clean aqueous media. Special focus is given to novel greener approaches based on lignocellulose flocculants and other biomaterials. In the final part of the present review, it was given a proof of concept, using a bioflocculant to remove micronized plastic from aqueous medium. The obtained results demonstrate the huge potential of these biopolymers to clean waters from the microplastics threat, using flocculants with appropriate structure.},

abstract = {Increasing amounts of plastic waste in the environment and their fragmentation into smaller particles known as microplastics (particles, <5 mm) have raised global concerns due to their persistency in the environment and their potential to act as vectors for harmful substances or pathogenic microorganisms. One possible solution to this problem is biodegradation of plastics by microorganisms. However, the scientific information on plastic-degrading microorganisms is scattered across different scientific publications. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) with predefined criteria using the online databases of Scopus and Web of Science to find papers on bacterial biodegradation of synthetic petroleum-based polymers. The aims of this SLR were to provide an updated list of all of the currently known bacteria claimed to biodegrade synthetic plastics, to determine and define the best methods to assess biodegradation, to critically evaluate the existing studies, and to propose directions for future research on polymer biodegradation in support of more rapid development of biodegradation technologies. Most of the bacteria identified here from the 145 reviewed papers belong to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and most were isolated from contaminated sites, such as landfill sites. Just under a half of the studies (44%) investigated the biodegradability of polyethylenes and derivates, particularly low-density polyethylenes. The methods used to monitor the biodegradation were mainly scanning electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We propose that: (1) future research should focus on biodegradation of microplastics arising from the most common pollutants (e.g. polyethylenes); (2) bacteria should be isolated from environments that are permanently contaminated with plastics; and (3) a combination of different observational methods should be used to confirm bacterial biodegradation of these plastics. Finally, when reporting, researchers need to follow standard protocols and include all essential information needed for repetition of the experiments by other research groups.},

Using ASTM standard D7991-15, the biodegradation of PHBV, PHBV with Misc (15 and 25 wt%) and PHBV with DDGS (15 and 25 wt%) was performed in a simulated marine environment for the first time, as indicated by a literature survey. PHBV/Misc (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 15 and 25% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Proteinaceous PHBV/DDGS (85/15) and (75/25) biocomposites showed 17 and 40% more biodegradation compared to PHBV, respectively. Furthermore, PHBV/Misc (75/25) and PHBV/DDGS (75/25) biocomposites were marine biodegraded in 412 and 295 days, respectively. In conclusion, proteinaceous fillers (DDGS) biocomposites have better marine biodegradability than miscanthus.},

We identify six putative PETase-like enzymes and four putative MHETase-like enzymes, with the potential to degrade aliphatic-aromatic polymers and their degradation products, respectively.

The results reveal a hierarchy of predictors to quantify surface erosion as well as combinations of features, like glass transition temperature and hydrophobicity, to classify ocean plastics into fast, medium, and slow degradation categories.

abstract = {Background: The biological degradation of plastics is a promising method to counter the increasing pollution of our planet with artificial polymers and to develop eco-friendly recycling strategies. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermoplast industrially produced from fossil feedstocks since the 1940s, nowadays prevalently used in bottle packaging and textiles. Although established industrial processes for PET recycling exist, large amounts of PET still end up in the environment - a significant portion thereof in the world's oceans. In 2016, Ideonella sakaiensis, a bacterium possessing the ability to degrade PET and use the degradation products as a sole carbon source for growth, was isolated. I. sakaiensis expresses a key enzyme responsible for the breakdown of PET into monomers: PETase. This hydrolase might possess huge potential for the development of biological PET degradation and recycling processes as well as bioremediation approaches of environmental plastic waste. Results: Using the photosynthetic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a chassis we generated a microbial cell factory capable of producing and secreting an engineered version of PETase into the surrounding culture medium. Initial degradation experiments using culture supernatant at 30 °C showed that PETase possessed activity against PET and the copolymer polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) with an approximately 80-fold higher turnover of low crystallinity PETG compared to bottle PET. Moreover, we show that diatom produced PETase was active against industrially shredded PET in a saltwater-based environment even at mesophilic temperatures (21 °C). The products resulting from the degradation of the PET substrate were mainly terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) estimated to be formed in the micromolar range under the selected reaction conditions. Conclusion: We provide a promising and eco-friendly solution for biological decomposition of PET waste in a saltwater-based environment by using a eukaryotic microalga instead of a bacterium as a model system. Our results show that via synthetic biology the diatom P. tricornutum indeed could be converted into a valuable chassis for biological PET degradation. Overall, this proof of principle study demonstrates the potential of the diatom system for future biotechnological applications in biological PET degradation especially for bioremediation approaches of PET polluted seawater.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

abstract = {We have known for more than 45 years that microplastics in the ocean are carriers of microbially dominated assemblages. However, only recently has the role of microbial interactions with microplastics in marine ecosystems been investigated in detail. Research in this field has focused on three main areas: (a) the establishment of plastic-specific biofilms (the so-called plastisphere); (b) enrichment of pathogenic bacteria, particularly members of the genus Vibrio, coupled to a vector function of microplastics; and (c) the microbial degradation of microplastics in the marine environment. Nevertheless, the relationships between marine microorganisms and microplastics remain unclear. In this review, we deduce from the current literature, new comparative analyses, and considerations of microbial adaptation concerning plastic degradation that interactions between microorganisms and microplastic particles should have rather limited effects on the ocean ecosystems. The majority of microorganisms growing on microplastics seem to belong to opportunistic colonists that do not distinguish between natural and artificial surfaces. Thus, microplastics do not pose a higher risk than natural particles to higher life forms by potentially harboring pathogenic bacteria. On the other hand, microplastics in the ocean represent recalcitrant substances for microorganisms that are insufficient to support prokaryotic metabolism and will probably not be microbially degraded in any period of time relevant to human society. Because we cannot remove microplastics from the ocean, proactive action regarding research on plastic alternatives and strategies to prevent plastic entering the environment should be taken promptly.},

We performed a 6-week exposure experiment with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles in the North Sea (UK) as well as sea surface sampling of plastic polymers in Northern European waters. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse plastisphere communities comprising prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing analysis revealed that plastisphere microbial communities on PET fragments varied both with season and location and comprised of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and members of the eukaryotes Bacillariophyceae and Phaeophyceae. Polymers sampled from the sea surface mainly comprised polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene particles. Variation within plastisphere communities on different polymer types was observed, but communities were primarily dominated by Cyanobacteria. This research reveals that the composition of plastisphere microbial communities in marine waters varies with season, geographical location and plastic substrate type.},

Multiple efforts have been made to identify and isolate microorganisms capable of utilizing synthetic polymers and recent results point towards the viability of a solution for this problem based on the biodegradation of plastics resorting to selected microbial strains. Herein, the response of the fungus Zalerion maritimum to different times of exposition to polyethylene (PE) pellets, in a minimum growth medium, was evaluated, based on the quantified mass differences in both the fungus and the microplastic pellets used. Additionally, molecular changes were assessed through attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Results showed that, under the tested conditions, Z. maritimum is capable of utilizing PE, resulting in the decrease, in both mass and size, of the pellets.

abstract = {The crisis facing the world's oceans from plastics is well documented, yet there is little knowledge of the perspectives, experiences and options of the coastal communities facing overwhelming quantities of plastics on their beaches and in their fishing waters. In emerging economies such as those in the Coral Triangle, the communities affected are among the poorest of their countries. To understand the consequences of ocean plastic pollution in coastal regions, through the eyes of local people, this study examines the knowledge, use, disposal and local consequences of single use plastics in remote island communities in two archipelagos of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using mixed methods—a survey of plastic literacy and behaviour, household interviews about purchasing and disposal, and focus group discussions to generate shared mental models—we identify a complex set of factors contributing to extensive plastic leakage into the marine environment. The rising standard of living has allowed people in low resource, remote communities to buy more single-use plastic items than they could before. Meanwhile complex geography and minimal collection services make waste management a difficult issue, and leave the communities themselves to shoulder the impacts of the ocean plastic crisis. Although plastic literacy is low, there is little the coastal communities can do unless presented with better choice architecture both on the supply side and in disposal options. Our results suggest that for such coastal communities improved waste disposal is urgent. Responsible supply chains and non-plastic alternatives are needed. Producers and manufacturers can no longer focus only on low-cost packaged products, without taking responsibility for the outcomes. Without access to biodegradable, environmentally friendly products, and a circular plastic system, coastal communities and surrounding marine ecosystems will continue to be inundated in plastic waste.},

abstract = {Plastic pollution is a critical environmental concern and comprises the majority of anthropogenic debris in the ocean, including macro, micro, and likely nanoscale (less than 100 nm in at least one dimension) plastic particles. While the toxicity of macroplastics and microplastics is relatively well studied, the toxicity of nanoplastics is largely uncharacterized. Here, fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) were used to investigate the potential toxicity of nanoplastics in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as to characterize the uptake and distribution of the particles within embryos and larvae. Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to PS NPs (0.1, 1, or 10 ppm) until 120 hpf. Our results demonstrate that PS NPs accumulated in the yolk sac as early as 24 hpf and migrated to the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, liver, pancreas, heart, and brain throughout development (48–120 hpf). Accumulation of PS NPs decreased during the depuration phase (120–168 hpf) in all organs, but at a slower rate in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Notably, exposure to PS NPs did not induce significant mortality, deformities, or changes to mitochondrial bioenergetics, but did decrease the heart rate. Lastly, exposure to PS NPs altered larval behavior as evidenced by swimming hypoactivity in exposed larvae. Taken together, these data suggest that at least some nanoplastics can penetrate the chorion of developing zebrafish, accumulate in the tissues, and affect physiology and behavior, potentially affecting organismal fitness in contaminated aquatic ecosystems.},

We investigated the microbial community composition and succession in coastal marine biofilms on plastic. Samples were collected over 75 days of immersion with strengthened samplings during the early stages of biofilm establishment. Biofilm composition was estimated using Illumina Miseq and microbial community interactions were assessed through microbial association network analysis. In silico analyses showed that primers used in most of previous studies considerably underestimated marine biofilm diversity. Unintentionally ignored so far, we showed that Flavobacteriia might be key actors in the functioning of marine biofilms. Gamma-proteobacteria from the genus Oleibacter strongly dominated microbial communities during the first hours of biofilm formation. These pioneer communities were quickly replaced by alpha-proteobacteria and Flavobacteriia. Bacterial communities exhibited fast temporal structure dynamics with taxa displaying rapid increases and declines. A total of 90% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were intermittent or ephemeral reinforcing the conclusion that marine biofilms are highly dynamics. With 2/3 of positive significant connections between bacterial OTUs, microbial biofilm communities appear to be more inclined to develop inter-specific cooperation rather than competition and might thus form sets of functional guilds with mutual metabolic exchanges.},

abstract = {Plastic pollution is generated by the unsustainable use and disposal of plastic products in modern society, threatening economies, ecosystems, and human health. Current clean-up strategies have attempted to mitigate the negative effects of plastic pollution but are unable to compete with increasing quantities of plastic entering the environment. Thus, reducing inputs of plastic to the environment must be prioritized through a global multidisciplinary approach. Mismanaged waste is a major land-based source of plastic pollution that can be reduced through improvements in the life-cycle of plastics, especially in production, consumption, and disposal, through an Integrated Waste Management System. In this review paper, we discuss current practices to improve life cycle and waste management of plastics that can be implemented to reduce health and environmental impacts of plastics and reduce plastics pollution. Ten recommendations for stakeholders to reduce plastic pollution include (1) regulation of production and consumption; (2) eco-design; (3) increasing the demand for recycled plastics; (4) reducing the use of plastics; (5) use of renewable energy for recycling; (6) extended producer responsibility over waste; (7) improvements in waste collection systems; (8) prioritization of recycling; (9) use of bio-based and biodegradable plastics; and (10) improvement in recyclability of e-waste.},

abstract = {Since the last few decades, the promiscuous and uncontrolled use of plastics led to the accumulation of millions of tons of plastic waste in the terrestrial and marine environment. It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate change. The concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of plastics containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient, eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few microbial agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and characterized for plastic degradation , but with low efficiency. It might be due to the predominance of uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain unexplored from the respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this problem, metagenomic analysis of microbial population engaged in the plastic biodegradation is advisable to decipher the microbial community structure and to predict their biodegradation potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis allow the rapid meta-genome screening that helps in the identification of total microbial community and also opens up the scope for mining genes or enzymes (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in polymer degradation. Further , the extraction of the core microbial population and their adaptation, fitness, and survivability can also be deciphered through comparative metagenomic study. It will help to engineer the microbial community and their metabolic activity to speed up the degradation process.},

abstract = {The production of synthetic oil-based plastics has led to the accumulation of huge amounts of the plastic waste in the environment, especially in the marine system, very often the final sink for many types of conventional wasted plastics. In particular, (micro)plastics account for the majority of litter items in the marine environment and a high percentage of such litter is originating from land sources. Attempts to mitigate the harmful effects of conventional plastics such as the development of novel management strategies together with the gradual substitution of them with biodegradable (bio)plastics are representing future solutions. However, high amounts of conventional plastics have been accumulating in the environment since several years. Although many studies reported on their potential biodegradation by microbes in and from terrestrial environments, very little is known about the biodegradability of these plastics in freshwater systems and only recently more reports on their biodegradation by marine microorganisms/in marine environment were made available. In this review, we first provide a summary of the approaches applied for monitoring and assessing conventional plastics biodegradation under defined conditions. Then, we reviewed historical and recent findings related to biodegradation of four major plastics produced in European Union (EU), i.e. Polyethylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, Polypropylene and Polystyrene, in terrestrial and aquatic environments and by pure and mixed microbial cultures obtained from them.},

abstract = {Millimeter-sized plastics are abundant in most marine surface waters, and known to carry fouling organisms that potentially play key roles in the fate and ecological impacts of plastic pollution. In this study we used scanning electron microscopy to characterize biodiversity of organisms on the surface of 68 small floating plastics (length range = 1.7-24.3 mm, median = 3.2 mm) from Australia-wide coastal and oceanic, tropical to temperate sample collections. Diatoms were the most diverse group of plastic colonizers, represented by 14 genera. We also recorded 'epiplastic' coccolithophores (7 genera), bryozoans, barnacles (Lepas spp.), a dinoflagellate (Ceratium), an isopod (Asellota), a marine worm, marine insect eggs (Halobates sp.), as well as rounded, elongated, and spiral cells putatively identified as bacteria, cyanobacteria, and fungi. Furthermore, we observed a variety of plastic surface microtextures, including pits and grooves conforming to the shape of microorganisms, suggesting that biota may play an important role in plastic degradation. This study highlights how anthropogenic millimeter-sized polymers have created a new pelagic habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. The ecological ramifications of this phenomenon for marine organism dispersal, ocean productivity, and biotransfer of plastic-associated pollutants, remains to be elucidated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Reisser et al.},

@article{Rhodes2018,
abstract = {A review is presented of the manufacture and use of different types of plastic, and the effects of pollution by these materials on animal, human and environmental health, insofar as this is known. Since 2004, the world has made as much plastic as it did in the previous half century, and it has been reckoned that the total mass of virgin plastics ever made amounts to 8.3 billion tonnes, mainly derived from natural gas and crude oil, used as chemical feedstocks and fuel sources. Between 1950 and 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tonnes of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste was generated, of which around 9% has been recycled, and 12% incinerated, with the remaining 79% either being stored in landfills or having been released directly into the natural environment. In 2015, 407 million tonnes (Mt) of plastic was produced, of which 164 Mt was consumed by packaging (36% of the total). Although quoted values vary, packaging probably accounts for around one third of all plastics used, of which approximately 40% goes to landfill, while 32% escapes the collection system. It has been deduced that around 9 Mt of plastic entered the oceans in 2010, as a result of mismanaged waste, along with up to 0.5 Mt each of microplastics from washing synthetic textiles, and from the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces. However, the amount of plastics actually measured in the oceans represents less than 1% of the (at least) 150 Mt reckoned to have been released into the oceans over time. Plastic accounts for around 10% by mass of municipal waste, but up to 85% of marine debris items - most of which arrive from land-based sources. Geographically, the five heaviest plastic polluters are P. R. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which between them contribute 56% of global plastic waste. Larger, primary plastic items can undergo progressive fragmentation to yield a greater number of increasingly smaller 'secondary' microplastic particles, thus increasing the overall surface area of the plastic material, which enhances its ability to absorb, and concentrate, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with the potential to transfer them to the tissues of animals that ingest the microplastic particles, particularly in marine environments. Although fears that such microparticles and their toxins may be passed via food webs to humans are not as yet substantiated, the direct ingestion of microplastics by humans via drinking water is a distinct possibility - since 92% of samples taken in the USA and 72% in Europe showed their presence - although any consequent health effects are as yet unclear. Foodstuffs may also become contaminated by microplastics from the air, although any consequent health effects are also unknown. In regard to such airborne sources, it is noteworthy that small plastic particles have been found in human lung tissue, which might prove an adverse health issue under given circumstances. It is also very striking that microplastics have been detected in mountain soils in Switzerland, which are most likely windborne in origin. Arctic ice core samples too have revealed the presence of microplastics, which were most likely carried on ocean currents from the Pacific garbage patch, and from local pollution from shipping and fishing. Thus, sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean, but these particles will be released into the global environment when the ice melts, particularly under the influence of a rising mean global temperature. While there is a growing emphasis toward the substitution of petrochemically derived plastics by bioplastics, controversy has arisen in regard to how biodegradable the latter actually are in the open environment, and they presently only account for 0.5% of the total mass of plastics manufactured globally. Since the majority of bioplastics are made from sugar and starch materials, to expand their use significantly raises the prospect of competition between growing crops to supply food or plastics, similarly to the diversion of food crops for the manufacture of primary biofuels. The use of oxo-plastics, which contain additives that assist the material to degrade, is also a matter of concern, since it is claimed that they merely fragment and add to the environmental burden of microplastics; hence, the European Union has moved to restrict their use. Since 6% of the current global oil (including natural gas liquids, NGLs) production is used to manufacture plastic commodities - predicted to rise to 20% by 2050 - the current approaches for the manufacture and use of plastics (including their end-use) demand immediate revision. More extensive collection and recycling of plastic items at the end of their life, for re-use in new production, to offset the use of virgin plastic, is a critical aspect both for reducing the amount of plastic waste entering the environment, and in improving the efficiency of fossil resource use. This is central to the ideology underpinning the circular economy, which has common elements with permaculture, the latter being a regenerative design system based on 'nature as teacher', which could help optimise the use of resources in town and city environments, while minimising and repurposing 'waste'. Thus, food might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller inputs of fuels (including transportation fuels for importing and distributing food), water and fertilisers, and with a marked reduction in the use of plastic packaging. Such an approach, adopted by billions of individuals, could prove of immense significance in ensuring future food security, and in reducing waste and pollution - of all kinds.},

Here, we quantified and characterized PML ingested by these species in southern Brazil, and observed PML ingestion in 49 of 86 sampled individuals ($\sim$57.0%). Green turtles presented the highest rates and variety of ingested plastics, and such ingestion has been high at least since 1997. Omnivorous turtles presented higher PML ingestion than carnivorous ones. Loggerheads displayed a negative correlation between body size and number of ingested items. Green turtles ingested mostly flexible transparent and flexible/hard white plastics; loggerheads ate mainly flexible, hard and foam fragments, in white and black/brown colors. These results help us better understand PML ingestion by sea turtles, highlighting the seriousness of this threat and providing information for prevention and mitigation strategies.},

Microbial communities colonizing plastic have been characterized from several ocean regions and they are distinct from the communities of the surrounding waters, and a few plastic-degrading microorganisms have been isolated from other environments. Therefore, we propose that marine microorganisms have adapted to plastic as a surface for colonization and potentially degradation. When comparing the taxonomic patterns of plastic-associated, marine bacteria, recurring groups and families such as the families Erythrobacteraceae and Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria), Flavobacteriaceae (Bacteriodetes), and the phylum of cyanobacteria (such as the Phormidium genus) can be identified. Thereby, we provide a perspective on which bacterial candidates could play a role in the colonization and possible degradation of plastic in the oceans due to their occurrence on marine plastic debris. We emphasize the need for extended and reproducible collection of data to assess the existence of a core microbiome or core functionalities of the plastisphere and confirm the capability of these bacterial candidates for biodegradation of plastic. Furthermore, we suggest the next steps in research to elucidate the level of natural bioremediation and the exploitation of bacterial degradative mechanisms of plastic.},

abstract = {Microplastics are emerging contaminants in the marine environment. They enter the ocean in a variety of sizes and shapes, with plastic microfiber being the prevalent form in seawater and in the guts of biota. Most of the laboratory experiments on microplastics has been performed with spheres, so knowledge on the interactions of microfibers and marine organisms is limited. In this study we examined the ingestion of microfibers by the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida using three different types of polymers: nylon, polyester and polypropylene. The polymers were offered to both symbiotic (with algal symbionts) and bleached (without algal symbionts) anemones. The polymers were introduced either alone or mixed with brine shrimp homogenate. We observed a higher percentage of nylon ingestion compared to the other polymers when plastic was offered in the absence of shrimp. In contrast, we observed over 80% of the anemones taking up all types of polymers when the plastics were offered in the presence of shrimp. Retention time differed significantly between symbiotic and bleached anemones with faster egestion in symbiotic anemones. Our results suggest that ingestion of microfibers by sea anemones is dependent both on the type of polymers and on the presence of chemical cues of prey in seawater. The decreased ability of bleached anemones to reject plastic microfiber indicates that the susceptibility of anthozoans to plastic pollution is exacerbated by previous exposure to other stressors. This is particularly concerning given that coral reef ecosystems are facing increases in the frequency and intensity of bleaching events due to ocean warming. The ingestion and retention time of microfibers by sea anemones depend on the presence of chemical cues of prey in the seawater and on the symbiotic status of the anemone.},

abstract = {In order to produce sustainable, bio-based and highly biodegradable materials, composites based on poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and fibers of Posidonia oceanica (PO), a dominant Mediterranean seagrass, were produced by simple melt mixing and characterized in terms of thermal stability, morphology and rheological/mechanical properties. In view of their potential application in marine environments, degradation of the developed composites was evaluated under simulated and real marine environmental conditions for 1 year. Using 10 wt % of acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) as a plasticizer, smooth processing was achieved for up to 30 wt % of PO fibers, despite the reduction of the melt fluidity observed with increasing fiber loading. The tensile modulus slightly increased (from2 to 2.4GPa)while the tensile strength and the elongation decreased (from 23.6 to 21.5MPa and from 3.2 to 1.9%, respectively) by increasing the PO fiber content from 0 to 30 wt %. Interestingly, the impact resistance of the composites increased with the increasing of the PO content: the Charpy's impact energy increased from 3.6 (without fiber) to 4.4 kJ/m2 for the composite with 30 wt %. The results of the aerobic biodegradation under simulated marine conditions showed that the presence of PO fibers favored the physical disintegration of the composite increasing the biodegradation rate of the polymeric matrix: after 216 days, the composite with 20 wt % PO fibers showed a biodegradability of about 30% compared to 20%of the compositewithout fibers. Under realmarine conditions, the specimens containing PO fibers showed higher weight losses and deterioration of tensile properties compared to those without fibers. Presumably, biodegradation occurred after colonization of the specimen, and the specimens with 20 wt % PO fibers showed well-developed biofilm consisting of bacteria and fungi on the surface after only 3 months of incubation in marine sediments, unlike the no-fiber specimens. Consequently, the persistence of an adequate mechanical performance for a relatively long period (1 year), due to a moderate rate of biodegradation in the marine environment, make the developed PHBV/PO composites particularly suitable for the production of relatively low-cost and biodegradable items which are usable in the sea and/or sand dunes, increasing the market opportunities for biopolymers such as PHBV and, at the same time, finding an eco-sustainable valorization for the PO fibrous residues accumulated in large quantities on Mediterranean beaches, which represents a problem for coastal municipalities.},

abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) have been gaining the attention of environmental researchers since the 1960s anecdotal reports of plastic entanglement and ingestion by marine creatures. Due to their increasing accretion in aquatic environments, as well as resistance towards degradation, marine litter research has focused on microplastics more recently. In the present study, a relatively new method of biodegradation was implemented for the biodegradation of three structurally different MPs i.e. polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Periphytic biofilm was used for this purpose in various backgrounds of carbon sources (glucose, peptone, and glucose and peptone). Biodegradation of MPs was estimated in terms of weight loss. It was observed that the addition of glucose enhanced the biodegradation of MPs by periphyton biofilm for all MPs (from 9.52%–18.02%, 5.95%–14.02% and 13.24–19.72% for PP, PE and PET respectively) after 60 days compared to natural biofilm alone. To the contrary, peptone, and glucose and peptone together, were inhibitory. Biodegradation was further confirmed by morphological changes observed using SEM, FTIR spectra and GPC lent further support to the results whereby new peaks appeared along with reduction in old peaks and decrease in peak intensities. MiSeq sequencing shows that Deinococcus-thermus > Proteobacteria > Cyanobacteria are the dominant phyla in natural biofilms, and their relative abundances increase after the addition of glucose. However, the abundances shifted to Deinococcus-thermus > Cyanobacteria > Firmicutes > Bacteroidetes, when the biofilms were treated with either peptone alone, or with glucose and peptone together. Therefore, the change in biodegradation capability might also be due to the change in the microbial community structures after addition of the C-sources. These experiments provide an innovative approach towards effective biodegradation of MPs using a relatively new environment-friendly method.},

Additionally biodegradation, sorption on marine suspended particulate matter and sorption on various types of nano-TiO2 of BPA, OP, NP were studied. Experiments were carried out on plastics at various stages of degradation. The conducted experiment confirmed the flux of BPA, OP and NP from the studied plastics into seawater. The initial photodegradation of the plastic had a significant influence on the amount of the studied components released into water. During the first days of the experiment leaching was weaker from aged materials. After 60 days leaching of BPA and OP was higher for aged plastic compared to unaged. On average, suspension adsorbed OP, BPA and NP from seawater at respective levels of 37%, 75% and 100%. On the other hand, during biodegradation on average 25%, 9% and 2% of OP, BPA and NP respectively are removed from water. Nano-TiO2 of 21 nm pore size diameter adsorbed all the compounds more strongly than nano-TiO2 of 15 nm pores sized coated with Al and stearic acid. The strongest sorption (100%) on different types of nano-TiO2 was that of the most hydrophobic and more linear structured NP with just one phenol group. The weakest sorption was observed in the case of BPA, which is the least hydrophobic, and characterized by higher compared to NP and OP steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion.},

The results showed that both nano- and microplastics inhibited the growth of H. alkaliphila in high concentrations, while nanoplastics rather than microplastics influenced the growth inhibition, chemical composition and ammonia conversion efficiencies of H. alkaliphila at concentration of 80 mg/L. The ROS generation indicated oxidative stress induced by nano- but not microplastics, and the oxidative stress induced by nanoplastics may provide a significant effect on bacteria. Furthermore, the positively charged nanoplastics (amine-modified 50 nm) induced higher oxidative stress toward bacteria than that induced by negatively charged nanoplastics (non-modified 55 nm). The increased extracellular polymeric substances as evidenced by transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation suggested the possible bacterial protective mechanisms. The present study illustrates for the first time the impact of plastics debris on the inorganic nitrogen conversion efficiencies of marine bacteria. Our findings highlight the effects of microplastics on the ecological function of marine organisms.},

abstract = {This work sheds light on the physicochemical changes of naturally weathered polymer surfaces along with changes of polymer buoyancy due to biofilm formation and degradation processes. To support the degradation hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was conducted where a mixture of naturally weathered plastic pieces was incubated with an indigenous pelagic community. A series of analyses were employed in order to describe the alteration of the physicochemical characteristics of the polymer (FTIR, SEC and GPC, sinking velocity)as well as the biofilm community (NGS). At the end of phase II, the fraction of double bonds in the surface of microbially treated PE films increased while changes were also observed in the profile of the PS films. The molecular weight of PE pieces increased with incubation time reaching the molecular weight of the virgin pieces (230,000 g mol−1)at month 5 but the buoyancy displayed no difference throughout the experimental period. The number-average molecular weight of PS pieces decreased (33% and 27% in INDG and BIOG treatment respectively), implying chain scission; accelerated (by more than 30%)sinking velocities compared to the initial weathered pieces were also measured for PS films with biofilm on their surface. The orders Rhodobacterales, Oceanospirillales and Burkholderiales dominated the distinct platisphere communities and the genera Bacillus and Pseudonocardia discriminate these assemblages from the planktonic counterpart. The functional analysis predicts overrepresentation of adhesive cells carrying xenobiotic and hydrocarbon degradation genes. Taking these into account, we can suggest that tailored marine consortia have the ability to thrive in the presence of mixtures of plastics and participate in their degradation.},

abstract = {Plastic debris is ubiquitous and increasing in the marine environment [1]. A wide range of marine organisms ingest plastic, and its impacts are of growing concern [2]. Seabirds are particularly susceptible to plastic pollution because of high rates of ingestion [3]. Because marine plastics contain an array of hazardous compounds, the chemical impacts of ingestion are concerning. Several studies on wild seabirds suggested accumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in seabird tissues [4–7]. However, to date, the evidence has all been indirect [4–7], and it is unclear whether plastic debris is the source of these pollutants. To obtain direct evidence for the transfer and accumulation of plastic additives in the tissues of seabirds, we conducted an in vivo plastic feeding experiment. Environmentally relevant exposure of plastics compounded with one flame retardant and four ultraviolet stabilizers to streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas) chicks in semi-field conditions resulted in the accumulation of the additives in liver and adipose fat of 91 to 120,000 times the rate from the natural diet. Additional monitoring of six seabird species detected these chemical additives only in those species with high plastic ingestion rates, suggesting that plastic debris can be a major pathway of chemical pollutants into seabirds. These findings provide direct evidence of seabird exposure to plastic additives and emphasize the role of marine debris ingestion as a source of chemical pollution in marine organisms. Tanaka et al. show that feeding additive-laced plastic pellets to seabirds results in the accumulation of chemical additives in liver and adipose tissue at 101–105 times above baseline. These findings demonstrate seabird exposure to plastic additives and additives' importance as emerging pollution sources.},

Plastic litter can leach a variety of substances into marine environments; however, virtually nothing is known regarding how this affects photosynthetic bacteria at the base of the marine food web. To address this, we investigated the effect of plastic leachate exposure on marine Prochlorococcus, widely considered the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and vital contributors to global primary production and carbon cycling. Two strains of Prochlorococcus representing distinct ecotypes were exposed to leachate from common plastic items: high-density polyethylene bags and polyvinyl chloride matting. We show leachate exposure strongly impairs Prochlorococcus in vitro growth and photosynthetic capacity and results in genome-wide transcriptional changes. The strains showed distinct differences in the extent and timing of their response to each leachate. Consequently, plastic leachate exposure could influence marine Prochlorococcus community composition and potentially the broader composition and productivity of ocean phytoplankton communities.},

The oceans provide important and valuable resources such as food, energy, and water. They are also the main way of international trade and the main stabilizer of the climate. Hence, changes in the marine ecosystem caused by anthropogenic influences such as plastic pollution can have a dramatic impact on a global scale. Although the problem of plastics still remains unsolved, different ways are being considered to reduce their impact on the environment. One of them is to use microorganisms capable of degradation of plastic. A particularly interesting area is the application of microorganisms isolated from cold regions in view of their unique characteristics. Nevertheless, the interactions between plastic and microorganisms are still poorly known. Here, we present a review of current knowledge on plastic degradation and plastic-microorganism interactions in cold marine habitats. Moreover, we highlight the advantages of microorganisms isolated from this environment for eliminating plastic waste from ecosystems.},

abstract = {Most researches on the plastisphere in coastal environments deal with plastics floating in seawater. Comparatively smaller attention has been devoted to the plastisphere of plastics buried in marine sediments, and very little is known on that of plastics on coastal sand dunes. Yet, limited information is available on the impact of plastics, especially biodegradable plastics, on microbial organisms in their surroundings. Nevertheless, a large amount of plastics sink on the seabed or is deposited on beach-dune systems. We investigated the succession of plastisphere microbial community on two biodegradable composites based on poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and seagrass fibres (PHBV/PO), buried in seabed and dune sediments over a 27 months period in mesocosm. PHBV is regarded as a valuable alternative to conventional plastics and PHBV/PO has recently been designed for applications in coastal habitat restoration. We also examined the degradation rate and impact of these plastics on the microbial communities of surrounding sediments. Microbial communities of the surface of PHBV and PHBV/PO in seabed and dune sand differ from those of surrounding sediments, displaying a lower richness. Plastics colonization occurs largely from bacteria present in surrounding sediments, although the contribution from the water column bacterial pool could be not negligible for plastics in the seabed. No significant differences were detected between the communities of the two plastics and no significant impact of plastics on microbial community of the surrounding sediments was detected. The exceptional long duration of this study allowed to gain information on the succession of a plastisphere community over a previously unexplored time scale. Succession appears highly dynamic in dune sand even after two years, while the community structure in seabed seems to reach stability after one year. These findings highlight the importance of performing long-term studies when trying to characterize composition and dynamics of plastisphere bacterial communities.},

Recently, various researchers have studied the impact of (micro)plastics on marine life, biodiversity, and potential toxicity. Even if the consequences are still heavily discussed, prevention of unnecessary waste is desired. Especially, newly designed polymers that degrade in seawater are discussed as potential alternatives to commodity polymers in certain applications. Biodegradable polymers that degrade in vivo (used for biomedical applications) or during composting often exhibit too slow degradation rates in seawater. To date, no comprehensive summary for the degradation performance of polymers in seawater has been reported, nor are the studies for seawater-degradation following uniform standards. This review summarizes concepts, mechanisms, and other factors affecting the degradation process in seawater of several biodegradable polymers or polymer blends. As most of such materials cannot degrade or degrade too slowly, strategies and innovative routes for the preparation of seawater-degradable polymers with rapid degradation in natural environments are reviewed. It is believed that this selection will help to further understand and drive the development of seawater-degradable polymers.},

The order of sensitivity to 1 $\mu$m PVC microplastics among three marine diatoms was B13 > B280 > B255, showing that the toxic effects varied with different microalgae species. Furthermore, the presence of a siliceous cell wall played a minimal role in protecting cells from the physical attack of PVC microplastics, with no significant difference from the common cell wall. PVC microplastics caused dose-dependent adverse effects on three marine diatoms. High PVC concentrations (200 mg/L) reduced the chlorophyll content, inhibited Fv/Fm, and affected the photosynthesis of three marine diatoms. The PVC microplastics adsorbed and caused physical damage on the structure of algal cells. Interactions between PVC microplastics and diatoms may be the probable reason for the negative effects of PVC on diatoms.},

abstract = {The presence of plastics in the marine environment poses a threat to ocean life and has received much scientific and public attention in recent years. Plastics were introduced to the market in the 1950s and since then, global production figures and ocean plastic littering have increased exponentially. Of the 359 million tonnes (Mt) produced in 2018, an estimated 14.5 Mt has entered the ocean. In particular smaller plastic particles can be ingested by marine biota causing hazardous effects. Plastic marine debris (PMD) is exposed to physical, chemical and biological stressors. These cause macro and microplastic to break down into smaller fragments, including sub micrometre sized nanoplastic particles, which may account for an important but so far unevaluated fraction of the ocean plastic budget. Physicochemical and biological deterioration of PMD also leads to the release of more volatile compounds and the terminal oxidation of PMD, which most likely accounts for an important but also unevaluated fraction in the ocean plastic budget. This minireview provides an overview on (1) the quantity of plastic production and waste, pathways for plastics to enter the marine realm, the inventory of PMD and the negative effects of PMD to ocean life. (2) We discuss plastic degradation mechanisms in the ocean, expanding on the processes of photodegradation and biodegradation.

abstract = {Many commercial plasticizers are toxic endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are added to plastics during manufacturing and may leach out once they reach the environment. Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are now increasingly being replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC). While the metabolic pathways for PAE degradation have been established in the terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for ATBC biodegradation have not been identified previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the first time, identified the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to degrade three different plasticizers (i.e., DBP, DEHP, and ATBC) via a comprehensive proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-OMIC study also revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the $\beta$-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for ATBC than for PAE plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the biofilms that colonize plastics - the Plastisphere - to effectively biodegrade plastic additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment.},

abstract = {Background: Plastics now pollute marine environments across the globe. On entering these environments, plastics are rapidly colonised by a diverse community of microorganisms termed the plastisphere. Members of the plastisphere have a myriad of diverse functions typically found in any biofilm but, additionally, a number of marine plastisphere studies have claimed the presence of plastic-biodegrading organisms, although with little mechanistic verification. Here, we obtained a microbial community from marine plastic debris and analysed the community succession across 6 weeks of incubation with different polyethylene terephthalate (PET) products as the sole carbon source, and further characterised the mechanisms involved in PET degradation by two bacterial isolates from the plastisphere. Results: We found that all communities differed significantly from the inoculum and were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, i.e. Alteromonadaceae and Thalassospiraceae at early time points, Alcanivoraceae at later time points and Vibrionaceae throughout. The large number of encoded enzymes involved in PET degradation found in predicted metagenomes and the observation of polymer oxidation by FTIR analyses both suggested PET degradation was occurring. However, we were unable to detect intermediates of PET hydrolysis with metabolomic analyses, which may be attributed to their rapid depletion by the complex community. To further confirm the PET biodegrading potential within the plastisphere of marine plastic debris, we used a combined proteogenomic and metabolomic approach to characterise amorphous PET degradation by two novel marine isolates, Thioclava sp. BHET1 and Bacillus sp. BHET2. The identification of PET hydrolytic intermediates by metabolomics confirmed that both isolates were able to degrade PET. High-throughput proteomics revealed that whilst Thioclava sp. BHET1 used the degradation pathway identified in terrestrial environment counterparts, these were absent in Bacillus sp. BHET2, indicating that either the enzymes used by this bacterium share little homology with those characterised previously, or that this bacterium uses a novel pathway for PET degradation. Conclusions: Overall, the results of our multi-OMIC characterisation of PET degradation provide a significant step forwards in our understanding of marine plastic degradation by bacterial isolates and communities and evidences the biodegrading potential extant in the plastisphere of marine plastic debris.

This microbial community - the Plastisphere - has recently sparked a multitude of scientific inquiries and generated a breadth of knowledge, which we bring together in this review. Besides providing a better understanding of community composition and biofilm development in marine ecosystems, we critically discuss current research on plastic biodegradation and the identification of potentially pathogenic "hitchhikers"in the Plastisphere. The Plastisphere is at the interface between the plastic and its surrounding milieu, and thus drives every interaction that this synthetic material has with its environment, from ecotoxicity and new links in marine food webs to the fate of the plastics in the water column. We conclude that research so far has not shown Plastisphere communities to starkly differ from microbial communities on other inert surfaces, which is particularly true for mature biofilm assemblages. Furthermore, despite progress that has been made in this field, we recognize that it is time to take research on plastic-Plastisphere-environment interactions a step further by identifying present gaps in our knowledge and offering our perspective on key aspects to be addressed by future studies: (I) better physical characterization of marine biofilms, (II) inclusion of relevant controls, (III) study of different successional stages, (IV) use of environmentally relevant concentrations of biofouled microplastics, and (V) prioritization of gaining a mechanistic and functional understanding of Plastisphere communities.},

Our studies also demonstrate that polyurethane is able to hydrolyze in artificial seawater and the hydrolysis rate increases as the PTIPSA content increases. Moreover, hydrolysis leads to a hydrophilic surface that is favorable to reduction of the frictional drag under dynamic conditions. Marine field tests reveal that polyurethane has good antifouling ability because polyurethane with a biodegradable PCL main chain and hydrolyzable PTIPSA side chains can form a self-renewal surface.

Nevertheless, information of the long-term variations in the composition of plastic-associated microbial communities in coastal waters remains limited. This study applied high-throughput sequencing to investigate the successional stages of microbial communities attached to polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics exposed for one year in the coastal seawater of China. The composition of plastisphere microbial communities varied remarkably across geographical locations and exposure times. The dominant bacteria in the plastisphere were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria class, particularly Rhodobacteraceae, followed by the Gammaproteobacteria class. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the microplastics showed signs of degradation. Microbial communities showed adaptations to plastisphere including more diverse microbial community and greater “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism” in metabolic pathway analysis. The findings elucidate the long-term changes in the community composition of microorganisms that colonize microplastics and expand the understanding of plastisphere microbial communities present in the marine environment.},

abstract = {Currently, microplastics (MPs) attracted increased attention for their ubiquity and toxic properties. In this study, marine medaka was used to explore the individual and combined toxicity of heavy metals (HMs) and MPs on intestinal bacteria and gonadal development. After exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs and HMs, significant alterations of intestinal microbiota were found. The MPs treatment reduced the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota, while the HMs and MPs-HMs treatments increased them, which were confirmed by the abundance changes of Proteobacteria. According to the KEGG analysis, the metabolism and environmental information processing (EIP) pathways in the microbial community were significantly affected. This study showed that the MPs-HMs treatment caused a higher pollution load on the gut of the marine medaka, and triggered more significant changes of specific bacterial species and gut function in the males. However, during the gonadal development, HMs and MPs-HMs treatments resulted in empty follicles (EF) and follicular atresia (FA), and altered the gene expression levels related to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In short, this study demonstrated that the reproductive disturbance was mainly due to HMs, but the combination of MPs and HMs did not strengthen the risk to the gonad development of the marine medaka.},

abstract = {While a large body of literature has shown that microplastics (MPs) are highly likely to be accumulated in marine organisms and terrestrial animals, information about toxicity of MPs in mammal from a mechanistic point of view is more limited. Our paper fills this knowledge gap by assessing polystyrene (PS)-MPs-mice system based on toxicity-based toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic (TBTK/TD) modeling to quantify organ-bioaccumulation and biomarker responses appraised with published dataset. The key TBTK-parameters for mice liver, kidney, and gut posed by 5 or 20 $\mu$m PS-MPs could be obtained. We found that gut had the highest bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of ∼8 exposed to 5 $\mu$m PS-MPs with a mean residence time of ∼17 days. We showed that threshold concentrations of 5 and 20 $\mu$m PS-MPs among the most sensitive biomarkers were 8 ± 5 (mean ± SE) and 0.71 ± 0.14 $\mu$g g−1 bw, respectively, implicating that particle size was likely to affect TK/TD behavior in mice. The mice-based TK parameters and threshold criteria greatly assist in designing robust researches to evaluate MP consumption by humans. We establish a TBTK/TD framework for mechanistically assessing potential from mice size-specific MPs exposure that would offer a tool-kit for extrapolating to humans from health risk assessment perspective.},

abstract = {Microplastic (MP) pollution is a significant environmental concern due to the persistence of MPs and their potential adverse effects on biota. Most scientific studies have examined the distribution, ingestion, fate, behavior, amount, and effect of MPs. However, few studies have described the development of methods for the removal and remediation of MPs. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the recent literature regarding the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs and discuss the associated degradation characteristics and mechanisms. Different types and combinations of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, bacterial consortia, and biofilms, that can degrade different MPs are categorized. This article summarizes approximately 50 recent papers. Twelve and 6 papers reported that bacteria and fungi, respectively, can degrade MPs. Nine articles indicated that bacterial consortia have the ability to degrade MPs, and 6 articles found that biofilms can also utilize MPs. Furthermore, to evaluate their associated degradation effects, the corresponding structural changes (i.e., macro size, surface morphology, and functional groups) in MPs after microbial degradation are examined. In addition, MP biodegradation is affected by microbial characteristics and environmental factors; therefore, the environmental factors (i.e., temperature, pH and strain activity) influencing MP degradation and the associated degradation effects (i.e., weight loss, degradation rate, and molecular weight change) are generalized. Furthermore, the mechanisms associated with the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs are briefly discussed. Finally, prospects for the degradation of MPs using microbes and future research directions are envisioned. This review provides the first systematic summary of the microbial-mediated degradation of MPs and provides a reference for future studies investigating effective means of MP pollution control.},

abstract = {Kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) biodegradation in anaerobic and aerobic activated sludge biochemical treatment systems were explored to determine the maximum rate and feasibility of HPAM biodegradation. The optimal nutrient proportions for HPAM biodegradation were determined to be 0.08 g{\textperiodcentered}L-1 C6H12O6, 1.00 g{\textperiodcentered}L-1 NH4Cl, 0.36 g{\textperiodcentered}L-1 NaH2PO4 and 3.00 g{\textperiodcentered}L-1 K2HPO4 using response surface methodology (RSM). Based on the kinetics, the maximum HPAM biodegradation rates were 16.43385 mg{\textperiodcentered}L-1{\textperiodcentered}d-1 and 2.463 mg{\textperiodcentered}L-1{\textperiodcentered}d-1 in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. The activation energy (Ea) of the aerobic biodegradation was 48.9897 kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1. Entropy changes ($\delta$S) of biochemical treatment system decreased from 216.21 J{\textperiodcentered}K-1 to 2.39 J{\textperiodcentered}K-1. Thermodynamic windows of opportunity for HPAM biodegradation were drawn. And it demonstrated HPAM was biodegraded into acetic acid and CO2 under laboratory conditions. Growth-process equations for functional bacteria anaerobically grown on polyacrylic acid were constructed and it confirmed electron equivalence between substrate and product.},
