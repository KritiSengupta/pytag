abstract = {The use of a combination of electrokinetic remediation and phytoremediation to decontaminate soil polluted with heavy metals has been demonstrated in a laboratory-scale experiment. Potato tubers were planted in plastic vessels filled with Zn, Pb, Cu and Cd contaminated soil and grown in a greenhouse. Three of these vessels were treated with direct current electric field (DC), three with alternative current (AC) and three remained untreated as control vessels. The soil pH varied from anode to cathode with a minimum of pH 3 near the anode and a maximum of pH 8 near the cathode in the DC treated soil profile. There was an accumulation of Zn, Cu and Cd at about 12 cm distance from anode when soil pH was 5 in the DC treated soil profile. There was no significant metal redistribution and pH variation between anode and cathode in the AC soil profile. The biomass production of the plants was 72% higher under AC treatment and 27% lower under DC treatment compared to the control. Metal accumulation was generally higher in the plant roots treated with electrical fields than the control. The overall metal uptake in plant shoots was lower under DC treatment compared to AC treatment and control, although there was a higher accumulation of Zn and Cu in the plant roots treated with electrical fields. The Zn uptake in plant shoots under AC treatment was higher compared to the control and DC treatment. Zn and Cu accumulation in the plant roots under AC and DC treatment was similar, and both were higher comparing to control. Cd content in plant roots under all three treatments was found to be higher than that in the soil. The Pb accumulation in the roots and the uptake into the shoots was lower compared to its content in the soil. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Plastic waste constitutes the third largest waste volume in Malaysian municipal solid waste (MSW), next to putrescible waste and paper. The plastic component in MSW from Kuala Lumpur averages 24% (by weight), whereas the national mean is about 15%. The 144 waste dumps in the country receive about 95% of the MSW, including plastic waste. The useful life of the landfills is fast diminishing as the plastic waste stays un-degraded for more than 50 years. In this study the compostability of polyethylene and pro-oxidant additive-based environmentally degradable plastics (EDP) was investigated. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) samples exposed hydrolytically or oxidatively at 60°C showed that the abiotic degradation path was oxidative rather than hydrolytic. There was a weight loss of 8% and the plastic has been oxidized as shown by the additional carbonyl group exhibited in the Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) Spectrum. Oxidation rate seemed to be influenced by the amount of pro-oxidant additive, the chemical structure and morphology of the plastic samples, and the surface area. Composting studies during a 45-day experiment showed that the percentage elongation (reduction) was 20% for McD samples [high-density polyethylene, (HDPE) with 3% additive] and LL samples (LLDPE with 7% additive) and 18% reduction for totally degradable plastic (TDP) samples (HDPE with 3% additive). Lastly, microbial experiments using Pseudomonas aeroginosa on carbon-free media with degradable plastic samples as the sole carbon source, showed confirmatory results. A positive bacterial growth and a weight loss of 2.2% for degraded polyethylene samples were evident to show that the degradable plastic is biodegradable. Copyright {\textcopyright} ISWA 2005.},

abstract = {Genetic variability in the plasticity of leaf area expansion in response to water deficit has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, the objective was to identify the underlying dynamic and cellular processes involved in this variability. Twenty-five accessions were subjected to identical soil water deficit treatments. In all accessions, the plasticity of leaf production was low compared with that of individual leaf expansion. A subset of accessions was selected for further dissection of individual leaf expansion into its underlying variables: the rate and duration of leaf expansion and epidermal cell number and area. In all accessions, water deficit had opposite effects on the rate and duration of leaf expansion. The accumulation of these effects was reflected in changes in final leaf area. At the cellular level, moderate water deficits had opposite effects on cell number and cell size, but more severe ones reduced both variables. The importance of these opposing effects is highlighted by the behaviour of the accession An-1, for which the compensation between the decrease in leaf expansion rate and the increase in the duration of expansion is total. This dynamic plasticity in response to water deficit is not detectable when only final measurements are done. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) starvation is highly notorious for limiting plant growth around the globe. To combat P-starvation, plants constantly sense the changes in their environment, and elicit an elegant myriad of plastic responses and rescue strategies to enhance P-solublization and acquisition from bound soil P-forms. Relative growth responses, P-solublization and P-acquisition ability of 14 diverse Brassica cultivars grown with sparingly soluble P-sources (Rock-P (RP) and Ca3(PO4)2 (TCP)) were evaluated in a solution culture experiment. Cultivars showed considerable genetic diversity in terms of biomass accumulation, concentration and contents of P and Ca in shoots and roots, P-stress factor (PSF) and P use efficiency. Cultivars showed variable P-stress tolerance, and cultivars depicting low PSF and high P-efficiency values were better adaptable to P-starvation. In experiment 2, after initial feeding on optimum nutrition for 12 d after transplanting (DAT), class-I (low P-tolerant (Oscar and Con-II)) and class-II (low P-sensitive (Gold Rush and RL-18)) cultivars were exposed to P-free environment for 25 d. All of the cultivars remobilized P from above ground parts to their roots during growth in P-free environment, the magnitude of which was variable in tested cultivars. P-concentrations ([P]s) at 37 DAT were higher in developing compared with developed leaves. Translocation of absorbed P from metabolically inactive to active sites in P-stressed plants may have helped class-I cultivars to establish a better rooting system, which provided a basis for enhanced P-utilization efficiency (PUE) and tolerance against P-stress. By supplying TCP and RP spatially separated from other nutrients in split root study, class-I cultivars were still able to mobilize RP and TCP more efficiently compared with class-II cultivars. To compare the growth behavior under P-stress, cultivars were grown in pots for 41 d after sowing, using a soil low in P (NaHCO3-extractable P = 3.97 mg/kg, Mehlich-III-extractable P = 6.13 mg/kg) with (+P = 60 mg P/kg soil) or without P addition (0P) in study 4. Tested cultivars showed genetic diversity in PUE, P-efficiency (PE), P-efficiency ratio (PER) and PSF. P-stress markedly reduced biomass and plant P contents. Cultivars that produced higher root biomass accumulated higher total P-contents (r= 0.98**), which in turn was related negatively to PSF (r=-0.95**) and positively to shoot and total biomass. PER and PE showed significant correlations with shoot P-contents and biomass. Cultivars depicting high PUE and PE, and low PSF values showed better growth behavior under low soil P-environment. Systematic analysis and deployment of the plant rescue traits underlying the nutrient acquisition, assimilation, utilization and remobilization under P-starvation will bring more sparingly soluble P into cropping systems and will help to scavenge more P from plant unavailable bound P reserves. {\textcopyright} 2009 Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {Young seedlings of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Soland in At.) were grown in rhizoboxes using intact spodosol soil samples from the southwest of France, in Landes of Gascogne, presenting a large variation of phosphorus (P) availability. Soils were collected from a 93-year-old unfertilized stand and a 13-year-old P. pinaster stand with regular annual fertilization of either only P or P and nitrogen (N). After 6 months of culture in controlled conditions, different morphotypes of ectomycorrhiza (ECM) were used for the measurements of acid phosphatase activity and molecular identification of fungal species using amplification of the ITS region. Total biomass, N and P contents were measured in roots and shoots of plants. Bicarbonate- and NaOH-available inorganic P (Pi), organic P (Po) and ergosterol concentrations were measured in bulk and rhizosphere soil. The results showed that bulk soil from the 93-year-old forest stand presented the highest Po levels, but relatively higher bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels compared to 13-year-old unfertilized stand. Fertilizers significantly increased the concentrations of inorganic P fractions in bulk soil. Ergosterol contents in rhizosphere soil were increased by fertilizer application. The dominant fungal species was Rhizopogon luteolus forming 66.6% of analysed ECM tips. Acid phosphatase activity was highly variable and varied inversely with bicarbonate-extractable Pi levels in the rhizosphere soil. Total P or total N in plants was linearly correlated with total plant biomass, but the slope was steep only between total P and biomass in fertilized soil samples. In spite of high phosphatase activity in ECM tips, P availability remained a limiting nutrient in soil samples from unfertilized stands. Nevertheless young P. pinaster seedlings showed a high plasticity for biomass production at low P availability in soils.},

The elimination efficiency of these different treatment processes, e.g., biological active slow underground passage, soil passage and technical treatment processes such as ozonization or multilayer and activated carbon filtration have been studied in three waterworks in the catchment area of the river Ruhr. In the untreated surface water the concentrations of the chlorinated organophosphates ranged 50-150 ng L -1 TCPP, 10-130 ng L-1 TCEP and 10-40 ng L-1 TDCP. The amounts of the non-chlorinated alkylphosphates were in the same order of magnitude (40 ng L-1 of the tributylphosphates, 170 ng L -1 of TBEP and 10 ng L-1 TPP) depending on weather and water flow. EHDPP was detected in the range of 1 ng L-1. After the drinking water purification process in all waterworks in this study, the concentrations of the selected substances were below the respective limit of quantification (0.3-3 ng L-1). While activated carbon filtration as well as extended passage through soil (10-15 days residence time) were effective in eliminating all selected compounds, ozonization and multilayer filtration did not contribute to the elimination of the chlorinated compounds. The elimination effect of slow underground passage combined with soil passage concerning the halogenated compounds seemed to depend on the hydraulic residence time. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The effects of applications of food waste and paper waste vermicomposts on some soil chemical and biological properties were evaluated in field plots planted with strawberries. Six-week old strawberries (Fragaria ananasa, var. Chandler) were transplanted into 4.5 m2 raised beds under a plastic tunnel structure measuring 9.14 × 14.6 × 3.6 m. Vermicompost were applied at rates of 5 or 10 t ha-1 supplemented with inorganic fertilizers to balance fertilizer recommendations for strawberries of 85-155-125 kg NPK ha-1. Effects of vermicomposts on strawberry growth and yields have been reported previously [Arancon, N.Q., Edwards C.A., Bierman P., Welch, C., Metzger, J.D., 2004. The influence of vermicompost applications to strawberries: Part 1. Effects on growth and yield. Bioresource Technology 93:145-153]. Total extractable N, NH4-N, NO3-N and orthophosphates did not differ significantly between treatments, except on the last sampling date (harvest date) in which significantly greater amounts of NH4-N, NO3-N and orthophosphates (P ≤ 0.05) were recorded in vermicompost-treated soils than in the controls. Two major results of vermicompost applications to soils were increases in dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass-N which were not dose-dependent. Increased dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass-N was correlated positively with the increased amounts of NH4-N, NO3-N and orthophosphates in the vermicompost-treated plots than in the controls. Increases in microbial populations and activities are key factors influencing rates of nutrient cycling, production of plant growth-regulating materials, and the build-up of plant resistance or tolerance to crop pathogen and nematode attacks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Four different plastic covers were used (T1: transparent polyethylene; T2: white polyethylene; T3: white and black coextruded polyethylene, and T4: black polyethylene), using uncovered soil as control (T0). The different treatments had a significant effect on mean root temperatures (T0 = 16°C, T1 = 20°C, T2 = 23°C, T3 = 27°C and T4 = 30°C) and induced a significantly different response in the S forms and Se concentration, showing the T3 treatment (27°C) the greatest concentration of total S and organic S in the stems and leaflets. The Se reached higher levels in the roots and tubers in T3.

abstract = {Aims: Assessment of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-degrading bacteria isolated from plastic waste dumpsites of Gulf of Mannar. Methods and Results: Rationally, 15 bacteria (GMB1-GMB15) were isolated by enrichment technique. GMB5 and GMB7 were selected for further studies based on their efficiency to degrade the HDPE and identified as Arthrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Assessed weight loss of HDPE after 30 days of incubation was nearly 12% for Arthrobacter sp. and 15% for Pseudomonas sp. The bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay showed that the cell surface hydrophobicity of Pseudomonas sp. was higher than Arthrobacter sp. Both fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and protein content of the biofilm were used to test the viability and protein density of the biomass. Acute peak elevation was observed between 2 and 5 days of inoculation for both bacteria. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum showed that keto carbonyl bond index (KCBI), Ester carbonyl bond index (ECBI) and Vinyl bond index (VBI) were increased indicating changes in functional group(s) and/or side chain modification confirming the biodegradation. Conclusion: The results pose us to suggest that both Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter sp. were proven efficient to degrade HDPE, albeit the former was more efficacious, yet the ability of latter cannot be neglected. Significance and Impact of the Study: Recent alarm on ecological threats to marine system is dumping plastic waste in the marine ecosystem and coastal arena by anthropogenic activity. In maintenance phase of the plastic-derived polyethylene waste, the microbial degradation plays a major role; the information accomplished in this work will be the initiating point for the degradation of polyethylene by indigenous bacterial population in the marine ecosystem and provides a novel eco-friendly solution in eco-management. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract = {Aims: To investigate the relationship between soil water holding capacity (WHC) and biodegradation of polyester polyurethane (PU) and to quantify and identify the predominant degrading micro-organisms in the biofilms on plastic buried in soil. Methods and Results: High numbers of both fungi and bacteria were recovered from biofilms on soil-buried dumb-bell-shaped pieces of polyester PU after 44 days at 15-100% WHC. The tensile strength of the polyester PU was reduced by up to 60% over 20-80% soil WHC, but no reduction occurred at 15, 90 or 100% soil WHC. A PU agar clearance assay indicated that fungi, but not bacteria were, the major degrading organisms in the biofilms on polyester PU and 10-30% of all the isolated fungi were able to degrade polyester PU in this assay. A 5{\textperiodcentered}8S rDNA sequencing identifed 13 strains of fungi representing the three major colony morphology types responsible for PU degradation. Sequence homology matches identified these strains as Nectria gliocladioides (five strains), Penicillium ochrochloron (one strain) and Geomyces pannorum (seven strains). Geomyces pannorum was the predominant organism in the biofilms comprising 22-100% of the viable polyester PU degrading fungi. Conclusions: Polyester PU degradation was optimum under a wide range of soil WHC and the predominant degrading organisms were fungi. Significance and Impact of the Study: By identifying the predominant degrading fungi in soil and studying the optimum WHC conditions for degradation of PU it allows us to better understand how plastics are broken down in the environment such as in landfill sites.},

Model experiments to treat combined sewer overflow, storm water and a post treatment of waste water were performed in controlled laboratory experiments. The indicator compounds were typical for waste water. Diverse chemical compound groups and a wide spectrum from the lipophilic (pKow = 5.9) to the hydrophilic (pKow = 2.6) were included. The system consisted of a layer with high organic content (with vegetation to prevent clogging), a sand filter and a gravel drainage layer. The organic layer was spiked with activated sludge to enhance biomass and biodegradation potential. Usually the elimination rates varied from 64% to 99%, with only one compound reaching as little as 17%. For a technical suitability assessment it was calculated how long these filters would be stable in eliminating organic compounds from water. The estimated operating times for such systems was found to be about 100 years for a stack height of 2 m a year in regard to most compounds in this study. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Studies were conducted to examine the mobility and bioavailability to earthworms (Eisenia fetida) of priority pollutant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in a suite of 11 soils and soil/lampblack mixtures obtained from former manufactured-gas plant sites. Contaminant mobility was assessed using XAD4 resins encapsulated in dialysis tubing, which were exposed to slurried soils for 15 d. These experiments showed that mobility of PAH in the different soils strongly correlated to the levels of volatile hydrocarbons (namely, gasoline- and diesel-range organics [GRO and DRO]) that existed in the soils as co-contaminants. Actual PAH bioavailability (as measured by earthworm PAH concentrations) also appeared to depend on GRO + DRO levels, although this was most evident at high levels of these contaminants. These findings are discussed in view of the effects of diesel-range organics on oil viscosity, assuming that the hydrocarbon contaminants in these soils exist in the form of distinct adsorbed oil phases. This study, therefore, extends correlations between carrier-oil viscosity and dissolved solute bioavailability, previously observed in a number of other in vitro and whole-organism tests (and in bacterial mutagenicity studies in soil), to multicellular organisms inhabiting contaminated-soil systems.},

abstract = {Lianas differ from trees in many life history characteristics, and we predicted that they are phenotypically more responsive to environmental variation than trees. We analyzed responsiveness to light and nutrient availability of five Bauhinia species (three lianas and two trees). Seedlings were grown in a shade house in two light regimes (5 and 25% of full sunlight) and two nutrient supply regimes (field soil and N fertilization equivalent to 100 kg ha-1), and important growth-related physiological and morphological plant parameters were measured. Light availability affected most of the measured variables, whereas N addition had only weak effects. In the four light-demanding species (two lianas and two trees), relative plant biomass growth rate increased and specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with increased light availability, whereas a shade-tolerant liana did not respond. Leaf N concentration and light-saturated photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area increased in response to increased irradiance or soil N in the light-demanding tree species and the shade-tolerant liana, but not in the two light-demanding lianas. The light-demanding lianas also had higher SLA and leaf mass ratio, resulting in a higher leaf area ratio (LAR) in high light, whereas the light-demanding trees did not. Across all treatments, mean plasticity indices of physiological and morphological traits, and all traits combined were similar among the studied species. Plasticity was higher in response to light than to N, indicating that light is the main factor controlling seedling responses of the studied species. Although lianas and trees did not differ in mean plasticity in response to light and N, the light-demanding lianas were phenotypically less plastic in LAR and in photosynthetic rates and biomass allocation than the trees. Light and N interacted in their effects on most physiological variables, but the consequences for relative growth rate differed little among species. We conclude that, contrary to our predictions, lianas were no more responsive to variation in light and N availability than trees. {\textcopyright} 2008 Heron Publishing.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the biodegradation of the phthalate acid esters (PAEs) di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in compost and compost-amended soil. DBP (50 mg kg-1) and DEHP (50 mg kg-1) were added to the two types of compost (straw and animal manure) and subsequently added to the soil; they were tested as a single compound and in combination. Optimal PAE degradation in soil was at pH 7 and 30 °C. The degradation of PAE was enhanced when DBP and DEHP were simultaneously present in the soil. The addition of either of the two types of compost individually also improved the rate of PAE degradation. Compost samples were separated into fractions with various particle size ranges, which spanned from 0.1-0.45 to 500-2000 $\mu$m. We observed that the compost fractions with smaller particle sizes demonstrated higher PAE degradation rates. When the different compost fractions were added to soil, however, compost particle size had no significant effect on the rate of PAE degradation. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Twelve Gram-positive phthalate ester degraders were isolated from soil. Using Biolog GP2 plates, eight of them were identified as belonging to the Corynebacterium-Mycobacterium-Nocardia group, while the remaining four were unidentifiable. When cultured in the presence of di-butyl-phthalate (DBP) in basal salts solution, five of these isolates accomplished more than 90% of DBP degradation within 48 h (fast group), three were placed in the medium group, and the remaining four were placed in the slow group which caused less than 30% of DBP degradation within the same period of time. A 420 bp DNA fragment was amplified from six isolates and none of them fell within the slow group. When compared with the large subunit of phthalate dioxygenase gene (phtA) of Arthrobacter keyseri, 83% and 91% similarities were evident in the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. However, no correlation between cell surface hydrophobicity and phthalate degradation ability was evident. Six surfactants (Brij 30, Brij 35, Tergitoltype NP-10, Triton N-101, Triton X-100 and SDS) were tested for their abilities to increase degradation rate. When added at the critical micellar concentration (CMC), they all displayed strong growth inhibition against the three bacteria tested, with Brij 30 been the least toxic to isolates G2 and G11, and Brij 35 had the least inhibitory effect for G1. When half the CMC of Brij 30 was incorporated into the basal salts, the inhibitory effect on DBP degradation remained. Soil helped to minimize surfactant toxicity of surfactant and increase the degradation potential of some of the test bacteria. When DBP-amended soil had been aged for three months, decreases in bioavailability were observed but the effect varied tremendously between different organisms. For isolates G1, G2, G5, G7 and G17 the aging effects were almost non-exist. The present study indicates that selection of a suitable degrader may minimize the undesired effect of aging on bioremediation process. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effective coagulation and separation of particles in a soil-washed solution is required for a successful soil washing process. The effectiveness of chitosan (CS), a polycationic biodegradable polymer, as a coagulant was compared to polyacrylamide (PAA) and polyaluminium chloride (PAC) for the coagulation of a soil suspension (5 g L-1). The effect of surfactants in the coagulation process was investigated using Triton X-100 (TX-100), a nonionic surfactant, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic surfactant. CS (5 mg L-1) removed 86% and 63% of the suspended soil in the presence of TX-100 (5 g L-1) and SDS (5 g L-1), respectively, after 30 min at a pH of 6. The results prove that coagulation in the presence of TX-100 is more effective than with SDS. CS was found to be more efficient compared to PAA and PAC under all coagulation conditions. The optimum concentration of CS required for maximum coagulation of soil suspension was 5 mg L-1. PAA and PAC could not achieve the same degree soil removal as CS even after increasing their concentrations up to 50 mg L-1. Maximum levels of 50% and 60% soil removal were achieved using PAA (50 mg L-1) and PAC (50 mg L-1), respectively, after 30 min from a 5 g L-1 suspension containing TX-100 (5 g L-1). The soil coagulation process was found to decrease with an increase in the pH of the suspension, and maximum coagulation was achieved with an acidic pH. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The genus Populus has a wide distribution in different climatic zones. Besides its economic and ecological relevance, Populus also serves as a model for elucidating physiological and molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance in tree species. In this review, adaptation strategies of poplars to excess soil salinity are addressed at different scales, from the cellular to the whole-plant level. Striking differences in salt tolerance exist among different poplar species and ecotypes, with Populus euphratica being outstanding in this respect. Key mechanisms identified in this species to mediate salt tolerance are compartmentalisation of Cl- in the vacuoles of the root cortex cells, diminished xylem loading of NaCl, activation of Na+ extrusion into the soil solution under stress, together with simultaneously avoiding excessive K+ loss by regulation of depolarisation-activated cation channels. This leads to improved maintenance of the K+/Na+ balance, a crucial precondition for survival under salt stress. Leaf cells of this species are able to compartmentalise Na+ preferentially in the apoplast, whereas in susceptible poplar species, as well as in crop plants, vacuolar Na+ deposition precedes apoplastic transport. ABA, Ca2+and ROS are involved in stress sensing, with higher or faster activation of defences in tolerant than in susceptible poplar species. P. euphratica develops leaf succulence after prolonged salt exposure as a plastic morphological adaptation that leads to salt dilution. Transgenic approaches to improve salt tolerance by transformation of candidate genes have had limited success, since salt tolerance is a multigenic trait. In future attempts towards increased salt resistance, barriers between different poplar sections must be overcome and application of novel biotechnological tools, such as gene stacking, are recommended. {\textcopyright} 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.},

In off-site ex situ bioremediation, the industrial area soil was contaminated with organic 5.4-6.9 g kg-1 total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), 14.5-19.0 g kg-1 oil and grease and 95-99 mg kg-1 di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and inorganic 104-136 mg kg-1 Cu, 430-691 mg kg-1 Pb and 477-578 mg kg-1 Zn. The removal by 3% SMC amendment applied twice accounted for 56-64%, 31-33% and 51-54% disappearance of the TPH, oil and grease and DEHP contaminants, respectively. For the latter soil, one 0.3% SMC application removed 40-45% of the initial 1.2 ± 0.2 g kg-1 TPH and 4.0 ± 0.6 g kg-1 oil and grease in 22 d. Further using four bacteria and four fungi inoculated onto the sterilized soil samples, samples with greater removal of the pollutants bore larger microbial populations. Thus SMC simultaneously degrades petroleum residues and reduces toxicity in less than a month. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work investigated biostimulation and bioaugmentation as strategies for removing polyurethane (PU) waste in soil. Soil microcosms were biostimulated with the PU dispersion agent "Impranil" and/or yeast extract or were bioaugmented with PU-degrading fungi, and the degradation of subsequently buried PU was determined. Fungal communities in the soil and colonizing buried PU were enumerated on solid media and were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Biostimulation with yeast extract alone or in conjunction with Impranil increased PU degradation 62% compared to the degradation in untreated control soil and was associated with a 45% increase in putative PU degraders colonizing PU. Specific fungi were enriched in soil following biostimulation; however, few of these fungi colonized the surface of buried PU. Fungi used for soil bioaugmentation were cultivated on the surface of sterile wheat to form a mycelium-rich inoculum. Wheat, when added alone to soil, increased PU degradation by 28%, suggesting that wheat biomass had a biostimulating effect. Addition of wheat colonized with Nectria haematococca, Penicillium viridicatum, Penicillium ochrochloron, or an unidentified Mucormycotina sp. increased PU degradation a further 30 to 70%, suggesting that biostimulation and bioaugmentation were operating in concert to enhance PU degradation. Interestingly, few of the inoculated fungi could be detected by DGGE in the soil or on the surface of the PU 4 weeks after inoculation. Bioaugmentation did, however, increase the numbers of indigenous PU-degrading fungi and caused an inoculum-dependent change in the composition of the native fungal populations, which may explain the increased degradation observed. These results demonstrate that both biostimulation and bioaugmentation may be viable tools for the remediation of environments contaminated with polyurethane waste.

abstract = {Soil fungal communities involved in the biodegradation of polyester polyurethane (PU) were investigated. PU coupons were buried in two sandy loam soils with different levels of organic carbon: one was acidic (pH 5.5), and the other was more neutral (pH 6.7). After 5 months of burial, the fungal communities on the surface of the PU were compared with the native soil communities using culture-based and molecular techniques. Putative PU-degrading fungi were common in both soils, as <45% of the fungal colonies cleared the colloidal PU dispersion Impranil on solid medium. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that fungal communities on the PU were less diverse than in the soil, and only a few species in the PU communities were detectable in the soil, indicating that only a small subset of the soil fungal communities colonized the PU. Soil type influenced the composition of the PU fungal communities. Geomyces pannorum and a Phoma sp. were the dominant species recovered by culturing from the PU buried in the acidic and neutral soils, respectively. Both fungi degraded Impranil and represented >80% of cultivable colonies from each plastic. However, PU was highly susceptible to degradation in both soils, losing up to 95% of its tensile strength. Therefore, different fungi are associated with PU degradation in different soils but the physical process is independent of soil type.

Sterile experiments revealed that the apparent inhibition of AOP could not be interpreted as such due to the confounding action of the particles, whereas, the nZVI-enhanced dehydrogenase activity could represent the genuine response of a stimulated microbial population or an artifact of ZVI reactivity. Overall, there was no evidence for negative effects of nZVI or mZVI on the processes studied. When examining the impact of redox active particles such as ZVI on microbial oxidation-reduction reactions, potential confounding effects of the test particles on assay conditions should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This quantity can be related to the density of covalent crosslinks in the wheat gluten network, which are induced by technological treatments. The biodegradability tests were performed in liquid medium (modified Sturm test) and in farmland soil. All gluten materials were fully degraded after 36 days in aerobic fermentation and within 50 days in farmland soil. No significant differences were observed between the samples. The mineralization half-life time of 3.8 days in the modified Sturm test situated gluten materials among fast degrading polymers. The tests of microbial inhibition experiments revealed no toxic effects of the modified gluten or of its metabolites. Thus, the protein bulk of wheat gluten materials is non-toxic and fully biodegradable, whatever the technological process applied. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The air DEHP concentrations (means) at the sites 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 km away from the plastic production building were about 9.4-12.8, 5.8-9.6, 1.6-5.0, and 0.04-0.27 $\mu$g m-3 dry weight (DW), respectively. Wind direction is a key factor influencing the measurable DEHP concentration of the air, which was highest in the downwind direction and lowest in the upwind direction, and thus the vegetables accumulated the highest DEHP contents in the downwind direction and the lowest quantities in the upwind direction. The highest DEHP accumulations content of bok choy, field mustard, eggplant, and cowpea were 52.0 ± 3.1, 43.1 ± 2.2, 36.2 ± 2.8, and 19.4 ± 0.47 mg kg-1 DW, respectively.

abstract = {We used the natural abundance of stable isotopic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in soil (0.053 m depth), plant xylem and precipitation to determine the seasonal changes in sources of soil water uptake by two native encroaching woody species (Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson, Juniperus virginiana L.), and two C4 grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Panicum virgatum L.), in the semiarid Sandhills grasslands of Nebraska. Grass species extracted most of their water from the upper soil profile (0.050.5 m). Soil water uptake from below 0.5 m depth increased under drought, but appeared to be minimal in relation to the total water use of these species. The grasses senesced in late August in response to drought conditions. In contrast to grasses, P. ponderosa and J. virginiana trees exhibited significant plasticity in sources of water uptake. In winter, tree species extracted a large fraction of their soil water from below 0.9 m depth. In spring when shallow soil water was available, tree species used water from the upper soil profile (0.050.5 m) and relied little on water from below 0.5 m depth. During the growing season (May-August) significant differences between the patterns of tree species water uptake emerged. Pinus ponderosa acquired a large fraction of its water from the 0.050.5 and 0.50.9 m soil profiles. Compared with P. ponderosa, J. virginiana acquired water from the 0.050.5 m profile during the early growing season but the amount extracted from this profile progressively declined between May and August and was mirrored by a progressive increase in the fraction taken up from 0.50.9 m depth, showing plasticity in tracking the general increase in soil water content within the 0.50.9 m profile, and being less responsive to growing season precipitation events. In September, soil water content declined to its minimum, and both tree species shifted soil water uptake to below 0.9 m. Tree transpiration rates (E) and water potentials ($\Psi$) indicated that deep water sources did not maintain E which sharply declined in September, but played an important role in the recovery of tree $\Psi$. Differences in sources of water uptake among these species and their ecological implications on treegrass dynamics and soil water in semiarid environments are discussed.},

abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA; 2,2-(4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl)propane) is predominantly used as an intermediate in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Traces of BPA released into the environment can reach the soil via application of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment systems that receive wastewaters containing BPA, or from leachate from uncontrolled landfills. The biodegradability of BPA has been previously investigated in several studies designed to simulate surface waters and biological wastewater treatment systems. However, there is little information available about the fate of BPA in soil. Therefore, laboratory soil degradation and batch adsorption studies were conducted with 14C-BPA and four soils according to international guidelines. The soils represented a broad range of physico-chemical properties. An important result of the degradation study was that, independent of the soil type, 14C-BPA was rapidly dissipated and not detectable in soil extracts following 3 days of incubation. Based on this result, a dissipation half-life of less than 3 days was estimated. The major route of dissipation of 14C-BPA in soil was the formation of bound residues that could not be recovered by exhaustive Soxhlet extraction. 14C-BPA was also shown to be transiently converted to up to five metabolites, but within 3 days, neither 14C-BPA nor 14C-metabolites were detectable in the soils. After 120 days incubation, significant amounts (up to 20% of the radioactivity applied) of the parent compound were recovered as 14CO2. Soil adsorption experiments indicated that the distribution coefficients (Koc) were between 636 and 931, classifying BPA as having low mobility for all tested soils. From the results of this study, it was concluded that if BPA reaches the soil compartment, it is not expected to be stable, mobile, or bioavailable. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The development of nitrogen-fixing nodules of the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, especially the early stages of root hair deformation and curling, infection thread formation, and nodule initiation, has been well studied from a genetic standpoint. In contrast, the factors important for the colonization of surfaces by rhizobia, including roots-an important prerequisite for nodule formation-have not been as thoroughly investigated. We developed conditions for analyzing the ability of two fast-growing rhizobia, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae, to produce biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as glass, plastic microtiter plates, sand and soil as a prelude to characterizing the genes important for aggregation and attachment. Factors involved in adherence to abiotic surfaces are likely to be used in rhizobial attachment to legume root cells. In this report, we show that S. meliloti exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants as well as exopolysaccharide overproducers exhibit reduced biofilm phenotypes that show parallels with their nodulation abilities. We also investigated two flagella-less S. meliloti mutants and found them to have reduced biofilming capabilities. To investigate whether there was a symbiotic phenotype, we tested one of the Fla- mutants on two different S. meliloti hosts, alfalfa and white sweetclover, and found that nodule formation was significantly delayed on the latter. {\textcopyright} 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {• Here, the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis (GDBH) was tested by quantifying temporal variation in the relative growth rate (RGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), and phenylpropanoid concentrations of two willow species (Salix sericea and Salix eriocephala) across five fertility levels. • Initially, RGR increased and total phenylpropanoids declined (although every individual phenolic did not) as fertility increased, but NAR was unaffected. Subsequently, NAR and phenylpropanoids declined in the low fertility treatment, generating a quadratic response of secondary metabolism across the nutrient gradient. As above- and below-ground growth rates equilibrated, NAR and phenylpropanoids increased in the low fertility treatment, re-establishing a negative linear effect of fertility on secondary metabolism. • A transient quadratic response of secondary metabolism is predicted when GDBH is integrated with models of optimal phenotypic plasticity, occurring when low NAR imposes carbon constraints on secondary metabolism in low nutrient environments. Once plants acclimate to nutrient limitation, the equilibrium allocation state is predicted to be a negative correlation between growth and secondary metabolism. • Although both willow species generally responded according to GDBH, the complexity observed suggests that prediction of the effects of nutrient availability on secondary metabolism (and other plastic responses) in specific cases requires a priori knowledge of the physiological status of the plant and soil nutrient availability. {\textcopyright} The Authors (2007).},

The present study investigated the discharge of emerging contaminants into the Santa Ana River (CA, USA) and their attenuation during river transport and passage through a constructed wetland. Contaminants studied included pharmaceuticals (gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and carbamazepine) and their metabolites, hormones, the metabolites of alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEMs), N-butyl benzenesulfonamide (NBBS), and chlorinated tris-propylphosphates (TCPPs). The APEMs included alkylphenols (APs), short-chain AP polyethoxylates (APEOs), AP polyethoxycarboxylates (APECs), and carboxylated APECs (CAPECs). In wastewater treatment plant effluent, APECs and CAPECs represented the dominant APEM fraction (1.8-18.7 $\mu$g/L), whereas APEOs and APs contributed only small amounts to the overall APEM concentrations (0.10-0.92 and ≤0.1 $\mu$g/L, respectively) except where the effluent was infiltrated into soil (5.2 $\mu$g/L). In effluents, ibuprofen and its metabolites, TCPPs, and NBBS were detected regularly (<0.5 $\mu$g/L), and the other pharmaceuticals were detected occasionally. Transport in the Santa Ana River for 11 km resulted in the significant attenuation of all contaminants, from 67% for gemfibrozil to 100% for others. Wetland treatment (residence time, 2-4 d) resulted in partial removal of ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and TCPPs and transformed APEOs to APECs.},

abstract = {Contamination of soils with cadmium (Cd) is a serious global issue due to its high mobility and toxicity. We investigated the application of insoluble polyacrylate polymers to improve soil and plant health. Sorghum was grown in a Cd-contaminated sandy soil. Polyacrylate polymers at 0.2% (w/w) were added to half of the soil. Control soil without plants was also included in the experiment. Growth of sorghum was stimulated in the polymer-amended soil. The concentration of Cd in the shoots, and the activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase decreased in plants from polymer-amended soil compared with unamended control. The amount of CaCl2-extractable Cd in the polymer-amended soil was 55% of that in the unamended soil. The Cd extracted in sorghum shoots was 0.19 mg per plant grown on soil without polymer and 0.41 mg per plant grown on polymer-amended soil. The total amount of Cd removed from each pot corresponded to 1.5 and more than 6% of soil CaCl2-extractable Cd in unamended and polymer-amended soil, respectively. The activities of soil acid phosphatase, $\beta$-glucosidase, urease, protease and cellulase were greatest in polymer-amended soil with sorghum. In conclusion, the application of polyacrylate polymers to reduce the bioavailable Cd pool seems a promising method to enhance productivity and health of plants grown on Cd-contaminated soils. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aim: To select a polyethylene-degrading micro-organism and to study the factors affecting its biodegrading activity. Methods and Results: A thermophilic bacterium Brevibaccillus borstelensis strain 707 (isolated from soil) utilized branched low-density polyethylene as the sole carbon source and degraded it. Incubation of polyethylene with B. borstelensis (30 days, 50°C) reduced its gravimetric and molecular weights by 11 and 30% respectively. Brevibaccillus borstelensis also degraded polyethylene in the presence of mannitol. Biodegradation of u.v. photo-oxidized polyethylene increased with increasing irradiation time. Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) analysis of photo-oxidized polyethylene revealed a reduction in carbonyl groups after incubation with the bacteria. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that polyethylene - considered to be inert - can be biodegraded if the right microbial strain is isolated. Enrichment culture methods were effective for isolating a thermophilic bacterium capable of utilizing polyethylene as the sole carbon and energy source. Maximal biodegradation was obtained in combination with photo-oxidation, which showed that carbonyl residues formed by photo-oxidation play a role in biodegradation. Brevibaccillus borstelensis also degraded the CH2 backbone of nonirradiated polyethylene. Significance and Impact of the Study: Biodegradation of polyethylene by a single bacterial strain contributes to our understanding of the process and the factors affecting polyethylene biodegradation. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract = {The incidence of obesity and overweight has reached epidemic levels in the United States and developed countries worldwide. Even more alarming is the increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases in younger children and adolescents. Infants born to obese, overweight, and diabetic mothers (even when normal weight) have increased adiposity and are at increased risk of later metabolic disease. In addition to maternal glucose, hyperlipidemia and inflammation may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic through fetal metabolic programming, the mechanisms of which are not well understood. Pregravid obesity, when combined with normal changes in maternal metabolism, may magnify increases in inflammation and blood lipids, which can have profound effects on the developing embryo and the fetus in utero. Fetal exposure to excess blood lipids, particularly saturated fatty acids, can activate proinflammatory pathways, which could impact substrate metabolism and mitochondrial function, as well as stem cell fate, all of which affect organ development and the response to the postnatal environment. Fetal and neonatal life are characterized by tremendous plasticity and the ability to respond to environmental factors (nutrients, oxygen, hormones) by altering gene expression levels via epigenetic modifications. Given that lipids act as both transcriptional activators and signaling molecules, excess fetal lipid exposure may regulate genes involved in lipid sensing and metabolism through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is characterized by covalent modifications to DNA and chromatin that alter gene expression independent of gene sequence. Epigenetic modifications can be maintained through positive and negative feedback loops, thereby creating stable changes in the expression of metabolic genes and their main transcriptional regulators. The purpose of this article is to review current literature on maternal-fetal lipid metabolism and maternal obesity outcomes and to suggest some potential mechanisms for fetal metabolic programming in key organ systems that regulate postnatal energy balance, with an emphasis on epigenetics and the intrauterine environment.

abstract = {Soil nutrients are distributed in a non-uniform or 'patchy' manner. It is well established that the modular nature of root systems allows them to show both morphological and/or physiological plasticity upon encountering nutrient-rich patches. These plastic responses are widely believed to be foraging mechanisms by the plant to enhance nutrient resource capture. Although morphological plasticity has traditionally been viewed as the more expensive option as it requires new root construction, more recent evidence suggests this may not necessarily be the case. Moreover, plants may be able to recapture most of the initial outlay involved in new root construction, again lowering the overall cost to the plant. Under natural conditions the roots of most plant species have an additional nutrient acquisition mechanism namely mycorrhizal symbiosis. However, the impact of these important symbiotic associations upon the host plant's response to nutrient patches has received relatively little attention. The mycorrhizal fungal symbiont should, in theory, be better able to compete directly with the rest of the microbial community for the nutrients in the patch. This could potentially be important to the host plant, as generally, root proliferation responses are more important for interspecific plant, than plant-microbial, competition. {\textcopyright} The Author [2005].

This Gram-negative bacterium exists as a soil saprophyte in melioidosis-endemic areas of the world and accounts for 20% of community-acquired septicaemias in northeastern Thailand where half of those affected die. Here we report the complete genome of B. pseudomallei, which is composed of two chromosomes of 4.07 megabase pairs and 3.17 megabase pairs, showing significant functional partitioning of genes between them. The large chromosome encodes many of the core functions associated with central metabolism and cell growth, whereas the small chromosome carries more accessory functions associated with adaptation and survival in different niches. Genomic comparisons with closely and more distantly related bacteria revealed a greater level of gene order conservation and a greater number of orthologous genes on the large chromosome, suggesting that the two replicons have distinct evolutionary origins. A striking feature of the genome was the presence of 16 genomic islands (GIs) that together made up 6.1% of the genome. Further analysis revealed these islands to be variably present in a collection of invasive and soil isolates but entirely absent from the clonally related organism B. mallei. We propose that variable horizontal gene acquisition by $\beta$. pseudomallei is an important feature of recent genetic evolution and that this has resulted in a genetically diverse pathogenic species.},

abstract = {The bacteria Sphingomonas sp. strain BSN22, isolated from bean fields, degraded octylphenol polyethoxylates (OPEOn) to octylphenol (OP) under aerobic conditions. This biodegradation mechanism proceeded by the following two-step degradation process: (1) degradation of OPEOn to octylphenol triethoxylate (OPEO3), (2) degradation from OPEO 3 to OP via octylphenoxy acetic acid (OPEC1). The chemical structure of OPEC1 was confirmed by analysis using 18O-labeled water. Quantitative studies revealed that magnesium (Mg2+) and calcium (Ca2+) ions were essential for the biodegradation of OPEOn. Furthermore, the rate of biodegradation was especially accelerated by ferric ions (Fe3+), and the accumulated amounts of endocrine active chemicals, such as OP, OPEO1, and OPEC1, significantly increased to the concentration of 22.8, 221.7, and 961.1 $\mu$M in the presence of 37.0 $\mu$M Fe3+, respectively. This suggests that environmental elements significantly influence the resultant ecotoxicity as well as the rate of their biodegradation in the environment. This study on the mechanism of OPEOn biodegradation may play an important role in understanding and managing environmental safety, including drinking water safety. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

Treatments in the column study were a control, and PAM mixed uniformly into the soil at rates of 0.02, 0.05, 0.08, 0.10, and 0.20%. We found that PAM had an important inhibitory effect on vertical P transport in the soil columns, with the 0.20% PAM treatment having the greatest significant reduction in leachate soluble P concentrations and losses resulting from nine leaching periods. Field experiments were conducted on 5m wide by 21m long natural rainfall plots, that allowed collection of both surface runoff and subsurface drainage water. Wheat was planted and grown on all plots with typical fertilizer applied. Treatments included a control, dry PAM at 3.9kgha-1, dry PAM at 3.9kgha-1 applied together with lime (CaCO3 at 4.9tha-1), and dry PAM at 3.9kgha-1 applied together with gypsum (CaSO4{\textperiodcentered}2H2O at 4tha-1). Results from the field plot experiment in which 5 rainfall events resulted in measurable runoff and leachate showed that all PAM treatments significantly reduced runoff volume and total P losses in surface runoff compared to the control. The PAM treatments also all significantly reduced water volume leached to the tile drain. However, total P losses in the leachate water were not significantly different due to the treatments, perhaps due to the low PAM soil surface application rate and/or high experimental variability. The PAM alone treatment resulted in the greatest wheat growth as indicated by the plant growth indexes of wheat plant height, leaf length, leaf width, grain number per head, and dried grain mass. Growth indexes of the PAM with Calcium treatments were significantly lesser. These results indicate that the selection and use of soil amendments need to be carefully determined based upon the most important management goal at a particular site (runoff/nutrient loss control, enhanced plant growth, or a combination). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Packaging waste accounted for 78.81 million tons or 31.6% of the total municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2003 in the USA, 56.3 million tons or 25% of the MSW in 2005 in Europe, and 3.3 million tons or 10% of the MSW in 2004 in Australia. Currently, in the USA the dominant method of packaging waste disposal is landfill, followed by recycling, incineration, and composting. Since landfill occupies valuable space and results in the generation of greenhouse gases and contaminants, recovery methods such as reuse, recycling and/or composting are encouraged as a way of reducing packaging waste disposal. Most of the common materials used in packaging (i.e., steel, aluminum, glass, paper, paperboard, plastics, and wood) can be efficiently recovered by recycling; however, if packaging materials are soiled with foods or other biological substances, physical recycling of these materials may be impractical. Therefore, composting some of these packaging materials is a promising way to reduce MSW. As biopolymers are developed and increasingly used in applications such as food, pharmaceutical, and consumer goods packaging, composting could become one of the prevailing methods for disposal of packaging waste provided that industry, governments, and consumers encourage and embrace this alternative. The main objective of this article is to provide an overview of the current situation of packaging compostability, to describe the main mechanisms that make a biopolymer compostable, to delineate the main methods to compost these biomaterials, and to explain the main standards for assessing compostability, and the current status of biopolymer labeling. Biopolymers such as polylactide and poly(hydroxybutyrate) are increasingly becoming available for use in food, medical, and consumer goods packaging applications. The main claims of these new biomaterials are that they are obtained from renewable resources and that they can be biodegraded in biological environments such as soil and compost. Although recycling could be energetically more favorable than composting for these materials, it may not be practical because of excessive sorting and cleaning requirements. Therefore, the main focus is to dispose them by composting. So far, there is no formal agreement between companies, governments and consumers as to how this packaging composting will take place; therefore, the main drivers for their use have been green marketing and pseudo-environmental consciousness related to high fuel prices. Packaging compostability could be an alternative for the disposal of biobased materials as long as society as a whole is willing to formally address the challenge to clearly understand the cradle-to-grave life of a compostable package, and to include these new compostable polymers in food, manure, or yard waste composting facilities.

Under in vitro conditions, $\lambda$-max shifts were quicker with nanoparticles and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) illustrated significant changes in CH/CH2 vibrations, along with introduction of hydroxyl residues in the polymer backbone. Moreover, simultaneous thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTG-DTA) reported multiple-step decomposition of LDPE degraded in the presence of nanoparticles. These findings were supported by scanning electron micrographs (SEM), which revealed greater dissolution of the film surface in the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, progressive degradation of the film was greatly enhanced when it was incubated under soil conditions for 3 months with the nanoparticles. The study highlights the significance of bacteria-nanoparticle interactions, which can dramatically influence key metabolic processes like biodegradation. The authors also propose the exploration of nanoparticles to influence various other microbial processes for commercial viabilities. {\textcopyright} The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.},

abstract = {A variety of biodegradable polyesters have been developed in order to obtain useful biomaterials and to reduce the impact of environmental pollution caused by the large-scale accumulation of non-degradable waste plastics. Polyhydroxyalkanoates, poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone), poly(L-lactide), and both aliphatic and aromatic polyalkylene dicarboxylic acids are examples of biodegradable polyesters. In general, most aliphatic polyesters are readily mineralized by a number of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms that are widely distributed in nature. However, aromatic polyesters are more resistant to microbial attack than aliphatic polyesters. The fungal biomass in soils generally exceeds the bacterial biomass and thus it is likely that fungi may play a considerable role in degrading polyesters, just as they predominantly perform the decomposition of organic matter in the soil ecosystem. However, in contrast to bacterial polyester degradation, which has been extensively investigated, the microbiological and environmental aspects of fungal degradation of polyesters are unclear. This review reports recent advances in our knowledge of the fungal degradation of microbial and synthetic polyesters and discusses the ecological importance and contribution of fungi in the biological recycling of waste polymeric materials in the biosphere.},

abstract = {There is a need to develop technology to allow the remediation of soil in polar regions that have been contaminated by hydrocarbon fuel spills. Bioremediation is potentially useful for this purpose, but has not been well demonstrated in polar regions. We investigated biopiles for on-site bioremediation of soil contaminated with Arctic diesel fuel in two independent small-scale field experiments at different sites on the Arctic tundra. The results were highly consistent with one another. In biopiles at both sites, extensive hydrocarbon removal occurred after one summer. After 1 year in treatments with optimal conditions, total petroleum hydrocarbons were reduced from 196 to below 10 mg per kg of soil at one site, and from 2,109 to 195 mg per kg of soil at the other site. Addition of ammonium chloride and sodium phosphate greatly stimulated hydrocarbon removal and indicates that biodegradation was the primary mechanism by which this was achieved. Inoculation with cold-adapted, mixed microbial cultures further stimulated hydrocarbon removal during the summer immediately following inoculation. At one site, soil temperature was monitored during the summer season, and a clear plastic cover increased biopile soil temperature, measured as degree-day accumulation, by 30-49%. Our results show that on-site bioremediation of fuel-contaminated soil at Arctic tundra sites is feasible.},

The ability of the bacterial isolates to produce various hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase, gelatinase and lipase were determined using the plate assay. The heterotrophic bacterial load was considerably higher than the fungal load. There was a predominance of the gram positive genus, Bacillus. Other genera encountered included Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Listeria and Vibrio. Their effectiveness on the degradation of commercial polythene carry bags made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied over a period of eight weeks in the laboratory. Biodegradation was measured in terms of mean weight loss, which was nearly 5 % after a period of eight weeks. There was a significant increase in the bacterial load of the soil attached to class 2 (HDPE) polythene. After eight weeks of submergence in mangrove soil, soil attached to class 1 and class 3 polythene mostly had Bacillus (Staphylococcus predominated in class 2 polythene). While most of the isolates were capable of producing hydrolytic enzymes such as amylase and gelatinase, lipolytic activity was low. Class 2 HDPE suffered the greatest biodegradation.},

The objectives of this paper are to identify environmentally compatible substitutes that could replace the current use of petrochemically derived plastic twines in greenhouse vegetable production, thus diverting them from landfills, and to assess the extent of their degradation via composting. Physical properties of the twines, including linear density, percent weight loss and tensile strength were monitored for the biodegradation tests. A pilot-scale composting trial was conducted in an in-vessel composting system. Results showed that the three biodegradable twine materials (cotton, jute and EcoPLA) could degrade readily in a composting environment within a reasonable time frame. Specifically, at the end of 105 days of composting, 85.3%, 84.8% and 81.1% of weight loss was observed for cotton, jute and EcoPLA, respectively. Furthermore, EcoPLA exhibited a slower decline in tensile strength with time, when compared to jute and cotton. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {• Background and aims: Organic P comprises 30-80 % of the total P in most agricultural soils. It has been proven that chickpea facilitates P uptake from an organic P source by intercropped wheat. In this study, acid phosphatase excreted from chickpea roots is quantified and the contribution of acid phosphatase to the facilitation of P uptake by intercropped maize receiving phytate is examined. • Methods: For the first experiment using hydroponics, maize (Zea mays 'Zhongdan No. 2') and chickpea (Cicer arietinum 'Sona') were grown in either the same or separate containers, and P was supplied as phytate, KH2PO4 at 0.25 mmol P L-1, or not at all. The second experiment involved soil culture with three types of root separation between the two species: (1) plastic sheet, (2) nylon mesh, and (3) no barrier. Maize plants were grown in one compartment and chickpea in the other. Phosphorus was supplied as phytate, Ca(H2PO4)2 at 50 mg P kg-1, or no P added. • Key results: In the hydroponics study, the total P uptake by intercropped maize supplied with phytate was 2.1-fold greater than when it was grown as a monoculture. In the soil experiment, when supplied with phytate, total P uptake by maize with mesh barrier and without root barrier was 2.2 and 1.5 times, respectively, as much as that with solid barrier. In both experiments, roots of both maize and chickpea supplied with phytate and no P secreted more acid phosphatase than those with KH 2PO4 or Ca(H2PO4)2. However, average acid phosphatase activity of chickpea roots supplied with phytate was 2-3-fold as much as maize. Soil acid phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere of chickpea was also significantly higher than maize regardless of P sources. • Conclusions: Chickpea can mobilize organic P in both hydroponic and soil cultures, leading to an interspecific facilitation in utilization of organic P in maize/chickpea intercropping. {\textcopyright} 2004 Annals of Botany Company.},

Two porous plastic soil moisture samplers were installed in each pot, one in the root compartment and the other in one of the hyphal Compartments. The soil in the outer compartments was amended with one of the four application rates of Zn (as ZnSO4) ranging from 0 to 1000 mg kg-1. Non-mycorrhizal controls were included, and there were five replicates of each treatment in a randomised block in a glasshouse. Uninoculated plants received supplementary P to avoid yield limitation due to low soil P status. Plants grew in the central compartment for nine weeks. Soil moisture samples were collected 4, 24 and 62 days after sowing to monitor changes in the Zn concentration and pH of the soil solution. At harvest, the mean mycorrhizal infection rate of inoculated plants ranged from 29% to 34% of total root length and was little affected by Zn application. Root and shoot yields were not affected by mycorrhizal infection. Plant Zn concentration and uptake were lower in mycorrhizal plants than non-mycorrhizal controls, and this effect was more pronounced with increasing Zn application rate to the soil. Soil solution Zn concentrations were lower and pH values were higher in mycorrhizal treatments than non-mycorrhizal controls and the mycorrhiza effect was more pronounced at higher Zn application rates. The proteotive effect of mycorrhiza against plant Zn uptake may have been associated with changes in Zn solubility mediated by changes in the soil solution pH, or by immobilisation of Zn in the extra-radical mycelium.

In the previous study, a DBP-degrading strain was isolated from activated sludge and identified by 16S rRNA as Deinococcus radiodurans. In this study, we added D. radiodurans into a soil microcosm and analyzed the structure of the whole bacterial community of the soil using a polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique. Meanwhile, the optimal conditions for DBP degradation were assessed by varying the temperature and initial pH of the culture, and by adding yeast extract and surfactants. The results show that the optimal conditions for DBP degradation in soil are a temperature of 35°C, a pH of 7, and the addition of Triton X-100 and yeast extract. Furthermore, the addition of D. radiodurans can also enhance DBP degradation in soil. The PCR-DGGE analysis showed that D. radiodurans could survive in the soil microcosm through 24 days of incubation. We hope that these findings may provide some useful information about the remediation of DBP in our environment. {\textcopyright} Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The biosorption process for removal of the heavy metal Cd2+ from contaminated soil is chosen for this study due to its economy, commercial applications, and because it acts without destroying soil structure. The study is divided into four parts (1) soil leaching: the relationships between the soil leaching effect and agitation rates, solvent concentrations, ratios of soil to solvent, leaching time and pH were studied to identify their optimum conditions; (2) adsorption Cd 2+ tests of immobilized Saccharomycetes pombe beads: different weight percentages of chitosan and polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL) were added to alginate (10 wt.%) and then blended or cross-linked by epichlorohydrin (ECH) to increase their mechanical strength. Next, before blending or cross-linking, different weight percentages of S. pombe 806 or S. pombe ATCC 2476 were added to increase Cd2+ adsorption. Thus, the optimum beads (blending or cross-linking, the percentages of chitosan, PVAL and S. pombe 806 or S. pombe ATCC 2476) and the optimum adsorption conditions (agitation rate, equilibrium adsorption time, and pH in the aqueous solution) were ascertained; (3) regeneration tests of the optimum beads: the optimum beads adsorbing Cd2+ were regenerated by various concentrations of aqueous HCl solutions. The results indicate that the reuse of immobilized pombe beads was feasible; and (4) adsorption model/kinetic model/thermodynamic property: the equilibrium adsorption, kinetics, change in Gibbs free energy of adsorption of Cd2+ on optimum beads were also investigated. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The integration of these responses at the whole-plant level requires long-distance signaling mechanisms communicating the information between the two indispensable organs, the shoot and the root, which respectively provide photosynthates and mineral nutrients. Although such long-distance signaling is not well understood at the molecular level, several molecules, including hormones, sugars, and nutrients themselves or their metabolites, have been suggested to function as the systemic signals. Moreover, recent discoveries of the phloem-mobile microRNA399s as key components mediating the plant responses to phosphorus stress reveal a novel biological role of small RNA in the long-distance signaling of nutrient status. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

During the last two decades, bioremediation has emerged as a potential tool to clean up the metal-contaminated/polluted environment. Exclusively derived processes by plants alone (phytoremediation) are time-consuming. Further, high levels of pollutants pose toxicity to the remediating plants. This situation could be ameliorated and accelerated by exploring the partnership of plant-microbe, which would improve the plant growth by facilitating the sequestration of toxic heavy metals. Plants can bioconcentrate (phytoextraction) as well as bioimmobilize or inactivate (phytostabilization) toxic heavy metals through in situ rhizospheric processes. The mobility and bioavailability of heavy metal in the soil, particularly at the rhizosphere where root uptake or exclusion takes place, are critical factors that affect phytoextraction and phytostabilization. Developing new methods for either enhancing (phytoextraction) or reducing the bioavailability of metal contaminants in the rhizosphere (phytostabilization) as well as improving plant establishment, growth, and health could significantly speed up the process of bioremediation techniques. In this review, we have highlighted the role of plant growth promoting rhizo- and/or endophytic bacteria in accelerating phytoremediation derived benefits in extensive tables and elaborate schematic sketches. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Furthermore, biodegradability tests demonstrated that the presence of the enzyme in the film-casting sample significantly influences the integrity of such a product that lasts longer than films obtained either with fennel waste alone or with a mixture of fennel waste and phaseolin.

Soil nitrogen availability and nitrogen resorption of different leaf age classes were assessed, as were the interactions between plant compartments, using 15N labelling and sink organ suppression. • The population growing on poorer soil had a shorter leaf life-span (17.9 vs 21.5 months) and a higher net contribution of leaf reserves to shoot growth (32% vs 15%), achieved by faster nitrogen resorption and greater shedding of young nitrogen-rich leaves. For both populations, wood contributed to over 40% of shoot nitrogen demand. Both the negative relationship between current-year shoot mass and the percentage of 1-yr-old attached leaves and the delay of leaf shedding after bud removal suggest that shoot development has a strong effect on leaf life-span. • Our results suggest that, contrary to the evolutionary response, plastic response to low soil nitrogen could reduce leaf life-span in evergreen plants. In addition, leaf life-span seems to be strongly influenced by the discrepancy between shoot nitrogen demand and soil nitrogen uptake rather than nitrogen demand alone.},

abstract = {Lead (Pb), depending upon the reactant surface, pH, redox potential and other factors can bind tightly to the soil with a retention time of many centuries. Soil-metal interactions by sorption, precipitation and complexation processes, and differences between plant species in metal uptake efficiency, transport, and susceptibility make a general prediction of soil metal bioavailability and risks of plant metal toxicity difficult. Moreover, the tight binding characteristic of Pb to soils and plant materials make a significant portion of Pb unavailable for uptake by plants. This experiment was conducted to determine whether the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), or acetic acid (HAc) can enhance the phytoextraction of Pb by making the Pb soluble and more bioavailable for uptake by coffeeweed (Sesbania exaltata Raf.). Also we wanted to assess the efficacy of chelates in facilitating translocation of the metal into the above-ground biomass of this plant. To test the effect of chelates on Pb solubility, 2 g of Pb-spiked soil (1000 mg Pb/kg dry soil) were added to each 15 mL centrifuge tube. Chelates (EDTA, EGTA, HAc) in a 1:1 ratio with the metal, or distilled deionized water were then added. Samples were shaken on a platform shaker then centrifuged at the end of several time periods. Supernatants were filtered with a 0.45 $\mu$m filter and quantified by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) to determine soluble Pb concentrations. Results revealed that EDTA was the most effective in bringing Pb into solution, and that maximum solubility was reached 6 days after chelate amendment. Additionally, a greenhouse experiment was conducted by planting Sesbania seeds in plastic tubes containing top soil and peat (2:1, v:v) spiked with various levels (0, 1000, 2000 mg Pb/kg dry soil) of lead nitrate. At six weeks after emergence, aqueous solutions of EDTA and/or HAc (in a 1:1 ratio with the metal) or distilled deionized water were applied to the root zones. Plants were harvested at 6 days after chelate addition to coincide with the duration of maximum metal solubility previously determined in this study. Results of the greenhouse experiment showed that coffeeweed was relatively tolerant to moderate levels of Pb and chelates as shown by very slight reductions in root and no discernable effects on shoot biomass. Root Pb concentrations increased with increasing levels of soil-applied Pb. Further increases in root Pb concentrations were attributed to chelate amendments. In the absence of chelates, translocation of Pb from roots to shoots was minimal. However, translocation dramatically increased in treatments with EDTA alone or in combination with HAc. Overall, the results of this study indicated that depending on the nature and type of Pb-contaminated soil being remediated, the bioavailability and uptake of Pb by coffeeweed can be enhanced by amending the soil with chelates especially after the plants have reached maximum biomass. {\textcopyright} 2008 MDPI.

abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) previously used as a timber treatment chemical to prevent sap stain and wood rot. Commonly used in wood treatment industries for the last 50 years, there are now many sites worldwide that are contaminated with PCP. Although persistent, PCP is a mobile contaminant and therefore has a propensity to leach and contaminate surrounding environments. Both willow (Salix sp., 'Tangoio') and poplar (Populus sp. 'Kawa') growing in an open-ended plastic greenhouse were found to tolerate soil PCP concentrations of 250 mg kg-1 or less and both species stimulated a significant increase in soil microbial activity when compared to unplanted controls. Both poplar and willow could not survive PCP concentrations above 250 mg kg-1 in soil. Pentachlorophenol degradation occurred in both planted and unplanted pots, but a higher rate of degradation was observed in the planted pots. Soil contaminated by wood-treatment activities often contains co-contaminants such as B, Cr, Cu and As, that are also used as timber preservatives. An additional column leaching experiment, done along side the potted trial, found that PCP, B, Cr, Cu and As were all present in the column leachate. This indicates that although Cu, Cr and As are generally considered immobile in the soil, they were mobilised under our column conditions. If a contaminated site were to be hydraulically 'sealed' using plants, a reticulation irrigation system should be installed to capture any contaminant leachate resulting from heavy rains. This captured leachate can either be independently treated, or reapplied to the site. Our data demonstrate a reduction in soil hydraulic conductivity with repeated application of leachate containing PCP and metal compounds but the soil did not become anaerobic. This would need to be considered in site remediation design. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The treatment of perchlorate-contaminated groundwater was examined using two side-by-side pilot-scale fixed-bed bioreactors packed with sand or plastic media, and bioaugmented with the perchlorate-degrading bacterium Dechlorosoma sp. KJ. Groundwater containing perchlorate (77$\mu$g/L), nitrate (4mg-NO 3/L), and dissolved oxygen (7.5mg/L) was amended with a carbon source (acetic acid) and nutrients (ammonium phosphate). Perchlorate was completely removed (<4$\mu$g/L) in the sand medium bioreactor at flow rates of 0.063-0.126L/s (1-2gpm or hydraulic loading rate of 0.34-0.68L/m 2s) and in the plastic medium reactor at flow rates of <0.063L/s. Acetate in the sand reactor was removed from 43±8 to 13±8mg/L (after day 100), and nitrate was completely removed in the reactor (except day 159). A regular (weekly) backwashing cycle was necessary to achieve consistent reactor performance and avoid short-circuiting in the reactors. For example, the sand reactor detention time was 18min (hydraulic loading rate of 0.68L/m2s) immediately after backwashing, but it decreased to only 10min 1 week later. In the plastic medium bioreactor, the relative changes in detention time due to backwashing were smaller, typically changing from 60min before backwashing to 70min after backwashing. We found that detention times necessary for complete perchlorate removal were more typical of those expected for mixed cultures (10-18min) than those for the pure culture (<1min) reported in our previous laboratory studies. Analysis of intra-column perchlorate profiles revealed that there was simultaneous removal of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and perchlorate, and that oxygen and nitrate removal was always complete prior to complete perchlorate removal. This study demonstrated for the first time in a pilot-scale system, that with regular backwashing cycles, fixed-bed bioreactors could be used to remove perchlorate in groundwater to a suitable level for drinking water. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {With the advent of recently promulgated Government regulations on plastics in Mauritius, a study was initiated to examine the biodegradability of two different types of plastic, namely Willow Ridge Plastics - PDQ-H additive (Plastic A) and Ecosafe Plastic - TDPA additive (Plastic B) under controlled and natural composting environments. The results obtained from the controlled composting environment showed that the cumulative carbon dioxide evolution for Plastic A was much higher than that for Plastic B. Plastic A therefore showed a higher level of biodegradation in terms of CO2 evolution than Plastic B. However, from the regression analysis, it was found that the level of CO2 varying with time fitted the sigmoid type curves with very high correlation coefficients (R2 values: 0.9928, 0.9921 and 0.9816, for reference material, inoculum and Plastic A, respectively). The corresponding F-values obtained from the ANOVA analysis together with significance levels of p < 0.05 indicated that the three treatments analysed in the biodegradability experiment were significant. The other experiment was undertaken to observe any physical change of Plastics A and B as compared to a reference plastic, namely, compostable plastic bag (Mater-Bi product-Plastic C), when exposed to a natural composting environment. Thermophilic temperatures were obtained for about 3-5 days of composting and the moisture content was in the range of 60-80% throughout the degradation process. It was observed that after 55 days of composting, Plastic C degraded completely while Plastic A and Plastic B did not undergo any significant degradation. It can be concluded that naturally based plastic made of starch would degrade completely in a time frame of 60 days, whereas plastics with biodegradable additive would require a longer time. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rhodococcus rhodochrous was grown in the presence of one of three plasticizers: bis 2-ethylhexyl adipate (BEHA), dioctyl phthalate (DOP) or dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP). None of the plasticizers were degraded unless another carbon source, such as hexadecane, was also present. When R. rhodochrous was grown with hexadecane as a co-substrate, BEHA was completely degraded and the DOP was degraded slightly. About half of the DOTP was degraded, if hexadecane were present. In all of these growth studies, the toxicity of the media, which was assessed using the Microtox assay, increased as the organism degraded the plasticizer. In each case, there was an accumulation of one or two intermediates in the growth medium as the toxicity increased. One of these was identified as 2-ethylhexanoic acid and it was observed for all three plasticizers. Its concentration increased until degradation of the plasticizers had stopped and it was always present at the end of the fermentation. The other intermediate was identified as 2-ethylhexanol and this was only observed for growth in the presence of BEHA. The alcohol was observed early in the growth studies with BEHA and had disappeared by the end of the experiment. Both the 2-ethylhexanol and 2-ethylhexanoic acid were shown to be toxic and their presence explained the increase of toxicity as the fermentations proceeded. The appearance of these intermediates was consistent with similar degradation mechanisms for all three plasticizers involving hydrolysis of the ester bonds followed by oxidation of the released alcohol.},

The validity of a proposed pathway for the degradation of these plasticizers by Rhodococcus rhodochrous has been confirmed by the identification of 2-ethylhexanal in gas phase emissions. Complete analyses of the aqueous and gas phases were able to account for more than 98% of the 2-ethylhexanol component of the DEHA added at the beginning of a growth study. Of this, 25% was either 2-ethylhexanol or 2-ethylhexanal that had been stripped into the gas phase and, at most, only 2% of the 2-ethylhexanol component could have been removed by mineralization. It is concluded that plasticizers are of significant environmental concern due to the resistance of the metabolites to biodegradation and their known health impacts. Two of the metabolites are of added concern due to their volatility and their potential impact on indoor air quality. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is a strong natural light gradient from the top to the bottom in plant canopies and along gap-understorey continua. Leaf structure and photosynthetic capacities change close to proportionally along these gradients, leading to maximisation of whole canopy photosynthesis. However, other environmental factors also vary within the light gradients in a correlative manner. Specifically, the leaves exposed to higher irradiance suffer from more severe heat, water, and photoinhibition stresses. Research in tree canopies and across gap-understorey gradients demonstrates that plants have a large potential to acclimate to interacting environmental limitations. The optimum temperature for photosynthetic electron transport increases with increasing growth irradiance in the canopy, improving the resistance of photosynthetic apparatus to heat stress. Stomatal constraints on photosynthesis are also larger at higher irradiance because the leaves at greater evaporative demands regulate water use more efficiently. Furthermore, upper canopy leaves are more rigid and have lower leaf osmotic potentials to improve water extraction from drying soil. The current review highlights that such an array of complex interactions significantly modifies the potential and realized whole canopy photosynthetic productivity, but also that the interactive effects cannot be simply predicted as composites of additive partial environmental stresses. We hypothesize that plant photosynthetic capacities deviate from the theoretical optimum values because of the interacting stresses in plant canopies and evolutionary trade-offs between leaf- and canopy-level plastic adjustments in light capture and use.},

abstract = {Young trees 0.03-1.7 m high of three coexisting Betula species were investigated in four sites of varying soil fertility, but all in full daylight, to separate nutrient and plant size controls on leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), light-saturated foliar photosynthetic electron transport rate (J) and the fraction of plant biomass in foliage (FL). Because the site effect was generally non-significant in the analyses of variance with foliar nitrogen content per unit dry mass (NM) as a covariate, NM was used as an explaining variable of leaf structural and physiological characteristics. Average leaf area (S) and dry mass per leaf scaled positively with NM and total tree height (H) in all species. Leaf dry mass per unit area also increased with increasing H, but decreased with increasing NM, whereas the effects were species-specific. Increases in plant size led to a lower and increases in NM to a greater FL and total plant foliar area per unit plant biomass (LAR). Thus, the self-shading probably increased with increasing NM and decreased with increasing H. Nevertheless, the whole-plant average MA, as well as MA values of topmost fully exposed leaves, correlated with NM and H in a similar manner, indicating that scaling of MA with NM and H did not necessarily result from the modified degree of within-plant shading. The rate of photosynthetic electron transport per unit dry mass (JM) scaled positively with NM, but decreased with increasing H and MA. Thus, increases in MA with tree height and decreasing nitrogen content not only resulted in a lower plant foliar area (LAR = FL/MA), but also led to lower physiological activity of unit foliar biomass. The leaf parameters (JM, NM and MA) varied threefold, but the whole-plant characteristic FL varied 20-fold and LAR 30-fold, indicating that the biomass allocation was more plastically adjusted to different plant internal nitrogen contents and to tree height than the foliar variables. Our results demonstrate that: (1) tree height and NM may independently control foliar structure and physiology, and have an even greater impact on biomass allocation; and (2) the modified within-plant light availabilities alone do not explain the observed patterns. Although there were interspecific differences with respect to the statistical significance of the relationships, all species generally fit common regressions. However, these differences were consistent, and suggested that more competitive species with inherently larger growth rates also more plastically respond to N and H. {\textcopyright} 2002 Annals of Botany Company.},

abstract = {The root system is fundamentally important for plant growth and survival because of its role in water and nutrient uptake. Therefore, plants rely on modulation of root system architecture (RSA) to respond to a changing soil environment. Although RSA is a highly plastic trait and varies both between and among species, the basic root system morphology and its plasticity are controlled by inherent genetic factors. These mediate the modification of RSA, mostly at the level of root branching, in response to a suite of biotic and abiotic factors. Recent progress in the understanding of the molecular basis of these responses suggests that they largely feed through hormone homeostasis and signaling pathways. Novel factors implicated in the regulation of RSA in response to the myriad endogenous and exogenous signals are also increasingly isolated through alternative approaches such as quantitative trait locus analysis.

Contrary to solid frozen media, the enrichment of liquid nutrient solutions at 0°C or supercooled solutions stabilized by glycerol at -1 to -5°C led to the isolation of bacteria representing the genera Polaromonas, Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter.

abstract = {Background, Aims and Scope. The global problem concerning contamination of the environment as a consequence of human activities is increasing. Most of the environmental contaminants are chemical by-products and heavy metals such as lead (Pb). Lead released into the environment makes its way into the air, soil and water. Lead contributes to a variety of health effects such as decline in mental, cognitive and physical health of the individual. An alternative way of reducing Pb concentration from the soil is through phytoremediation. Phytoremediation is an alternative method that uses plants to clean up a contaminated area. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the survival rate and vegetative characteristics of three grass species such as vetivergrass, cogongrass and carabaograss grown in soils with different Pb levels; and (2) to determine and compare the ability of the three grass species as potential phytoremediators in terms of Pb accumulation by plants. Methods. The three test plants: vetivergrass (Vetiveria zizanioides L.); cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica L.); and carabaograss (Paspalum conjugatum L.) were grown in individual plastic bags containing soils with 75 mg kg-1 (37.5 kg ha-1) and 150 mg kg-1 (75 kg ha-1) of Pb, respectively. The Pb contents of the test plants and the soil were analyzed before and after experimental treatments using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. This study was laid out following a 3 x 2 factorial experiment in a completely randomized design. Results. On the vegetative characteristics of the test plants, vetivergrass registered the highest whole plant dry matter weight (33.85-39.39 Mg ha-1). Carabaograss had the lowest herbage mass production of 4.12 Mg ha-1 and 5.72 Mg ha -1 from soils added with 75 and 150 mg Pb kg-1, respectively. Vetivergrass also had the highest percent plant survival which meant it best tolerated the Pb contamination in soils. Vetivergrass registered the highest rate of Pb absorption (10.16 ± 2.81 mg kg-1). This was followed by cogongrass (2.34 ± 0.52 mg kg-1) and carabao-grass with a mean Pb level of 0.49 ± 0.56 mg kg-1. Levels of Pb among the three grasses (shoots + roots) did not vary significantly with the amount of Pb added (75 and 150 mg kg-1) to the soil. Discussion. Vetivergrass yielded the highest biomass; it also has the greatest amount of Pb absorbed (roots + shoots). This can be attributed to the highly extensive root system of vetivergrass with the presence of an enormous amount of root hairs. Extensive root system denotes more contact to nutrients in soils, therefore more likelihood of nutrient absorption and Pb uptake. The efficiency of plants as phytoremediators could be correlated with the plants' total biomass. This implies that the higher the biomass, the greater the Pb uptake. Plants characteristically exhibit remarkable capacity to absorb what they need and exclude what they do not need. Some plants utilize exclusion mechanisms, where there is a reduced uptake by the roots or a restricted transport of the metals from root to shoots. Combination of high metal accumulation and high biomass production results in the most metal removal from the soil. Conclusions. The present study indicated that vetivergrass possessed many beneficial characteristics to uptake Pb from contaminated soil. It was the most tolerant and could grow in soil contaminated with high Pb concentration. Cogongrass and carabaograss are also potential phytoremediators since they can absorb small amount of Pb in soils, although cogongrass is more tolerant to Pb-contaminated soil compared with carabaograss. The important implication of our findings is that vetivergrass can be used for phytoextraction on sites contaminated with high levels of heavy metals, particularly Pb. Recommendations and Perspectives. High levels of Pb in localized areas are still a concern especially in urban areas with high levels of traffic, near Pb smelters, battery plants, or industrial facilities that burn fuel ending up in water and soils. The grasses used in the study, and particularly vetivergrass, can be used to phytoremediate urban soil with various contaminations by planting these grasses in lawns and public parks. {\textcopyright} 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe H{\"{u}}thig Jehle Rehm GmbH).},

abstract = {In abandoned or extensively managed grasslands, the mechanisms involved in pioneer tree species success are not fully explained. Resource competition among plants and microclimate modifications have been emphasised as possible mechanisms to explain variation of survivorship and growth. In this study, we evaluated a number of mechanisms that may lead to successful survival and growth of seedlings of a pioneer tree species (Pinus sylvestris) in a grass-dominated grassland. Three-year-old Scots pines were planted in an extensively managed grassland of the French Massif Central and for 2 years were either maintained in bare soil or subjected to aerial and below-ground interactions induced by grass vegetation. Soil temperatures were slightly higher in bare soil than under the grass vegetation, but not to an extent explaining pine growth differences. The tall grass canopy reduced light transmission by 77% at ground level and by 20% in the upper part of Scots pine seedlings. Grass vegetation presence also significantly decreased soil volumetric water content (Hv) and soil nitrate in spring and in summer. In these conditions, the average tree height was reduced by 5% compared to trees grown in bare soil, and plant biomass was reduced by 85%. Scots pine intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g), measured by leaf gas-exchange, increased when Hv decreased owing to a rapid decline of stomatal conductance (g). This result was also confirmed by $\delta$ 13C analyses of needles. A summer 15N labelling of seedlings and grass vegetation confirmed the higher NO3 capture capacity of grass vegetation in comparison with Scots pine seedlings. Our results provide evidence that the seedlings' success was linked to tolerance of below-ground resource depletion (particularly water) induced by grass vegetation based on morphological and physiological plasticity as well as to resource conservation. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract = {Bacteria have evolved a wide variety of metabolic strategies to cope with varied environments. Some are specialists and only able to survive in restricted environments; others are generalists and able to cope with diverse environmental conditions. Rhizobia (e.g. Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Azorhizobium species) can survive and compete for nutrients in soil and the plant rhizosphere but can also form a beneficial symbiosis with legumes in a highly specialized plant cell environment. Inside the legume-root nodule, the bacteria (bacteroids) reduce dinitrogen to ammonium, which is secreted to the plant in exchange for a carbon and energy source. A new and challenging aspect of nodule physiology is that nitrogen fixation requires the cycling of amino acids between the bacteroid and plant. This review aims to summarize the metabolic plasticity of rhizobia and the importance of amino acid cycling. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The structures and biodegradabilities of loose-fill foams, containing starch and polystyrene at ratios of 70:30 and 80:20, were evaluated using a laboratory composting system. Each formulation was foamed (extrusion expanded) using either 0.2% azodicarbonamide or 0.25% citric acid as the chemical blowing agent. Biodegradability, a measure of the quantity of material mineralized, was expressed as the percentage of CO2 in the exhaust gas eluted from the individual chambers. The CO2 generation peaked after about 15 days of composting, and then decreased. The rate and amount of CO2 eluted depended on the starch content in the foams. Similarly, there were significant differences in the rates and quantities of CO2 emissions for the foams blown with azodicarbonamide versus citric acid. At the end of the composting tests, the remaining foam material had fibrous and crumbly textures, presumably consisting primarily of polystyrene. FTIR and NMR spectra of the foams, taken after 39 days of composting, did not reveal the spectral features of starch, thereby confirming the decomposition of the starch. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Lysimeters were filled with the mine soil with no amendment (control), with a polyacrylate polymer, with a polymer removed from diapers, and with shredded diapers. The establishment of a plant cover was faster in soil amended with polymer from diapers, and 85 days after sowing the soil was completely covered in all treatments except control. The concentrations of trace elements in plant shoots decreased in amended soil. The activities of soil acid phosphatase, $\beta$-glucosidase, protease and cellulase were greatest in soil amended with the polyacrylate polymer or with polymer removed from diapers, while the application of shredded diapers leads to values that were in general intermediate between these treatments and unamended control. Basal- and substrate-induced respirations, and dehydrogenase were greatest in soil amended with polymers, but the presence of a plastic film and fibrous materials from shredded diapers prevented any improvement in these parameters compared with unamended soil. In the second experiment, we evaluated the risk of downward movement of polymers in columns of a sandy soil. Polymer from diapers, with or without Cu, was placed at a 10. cm-depth. Five leaching cycles with artificial rain took place and leachates were analyzed for organic matter and Cu. At the end of the experiment, the soil columns were sliced and each layer was analyzed separately. Some repacking of soil and polymer particles took place, but there was no indication that polymers moved to any great depth in soil columns. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) toxicities to Caenorhabditis elegans were investigated using multiple toxic endpoints, such as mortality, growth, reproduction and stress-related gene expression, focusing on the identification of chemical-induced gene expression as a sensitive biomarker for DEHP monitoring. The possible use of C. elegans as a sentinel organism in the monitoring of soil ecosystem health was also tested by conducting the experiment on the exposure of nematode to field soil. Twenty-four-hour median lethal concentration (LC50) data suggest that DEHP has a relatively high potential of acute toxicity to C. elegans. Decreases in body length and egg number per worm observed after 24 h of DEHP exposure may induce long-term alteration in the growth and reproduction of the nematode population. Based on the result from the C. elegans genome array and indicated in the literatures, stress proteins, metallothionein, vitellogenin, xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, apoptosis-related proteins, and antioxidant enzyme genes were selected as stress-related genes and their expression in C. elegans by DEHP exposure was analyzed semi-quantitatively. Expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-16.1 and hsp-16.2 genes was decreased by DEHP exposure. Expression of cytochrome P450 (cyp) 35a2 and glutathione-S-transferease (gst)-4, phase I and phase II of xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, was increased by DEHP exposure in a concentration-dependent manner. An increase in stress-related gene expressions occurred concomitantly with the deterioration on the physiological level, which suggests an increase in expression of those genes may not be considered as a homeostatic response but as a toxicity that might have physiological consequences. The experiment with the soil from the landfill site suggests that the potential of the C. elegans biomarker identified in laboratory conditions should be calibrated and validated for its use in situ. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their potential effect on the environment has become an important national and international issue. Dairy production, along with all other types of animal agriculture, is a recognized source of GHG emissions, but little information exists on the net emissions from dairy farms. Component models for predicting all important sources and sinks of CH4, N2O, and CO2 from primary and secondary sources in dairy production were integrated in a software tool called the Dairy Greenhouse Gas model, or DairyGHG. This tool calculates the carbon footprint of a dairy production system as the net exchange of all GHG in CO2 equivalent units per unit of energy-corrected milk produced. Primary emission sources include enteric fermentation, manure, cropland used in feed production, and the combustion of fuel in machinery used to produce feed and handle manure. Secondary emissions are those occurring during the production of resources used on the farm, which can include fuel, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, pesticides, plastic, and purchased replacement animals. A long-term C balance is assumed for the production system, which does not account for potential depletion or sequestration of soil carbon. An evaluation of dairy farms of various sizes and production strategies gave carbon footprints of 0.37 to 0.69kg of CO2 equivalent units/kg of energy-corrected milk, depending upon milk production level and the feeding and manure handling strategies used. In a comparison with previous studies, DairyGHG predicted C footprints similar to those reported when similar assumptions were made for feeding strategy, milk production, allocation method between milk and animal coproducts, and sources of CO2 and secondary emissions. DairyGHG provides a relatively simple tool for evaluating management effects on net GHG emissions and the overall carbon footprint of dairy production systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Dairy Science Association.},

abstract = {Halogenated organic compounds constitute one of the largest and most diverse groups of chemicals in the environment. Many of these compounds are toxic, persistent and, as a result of their often limited biodegradability, tend to bioaccumulate in the environment. Dibromoneopentyl glycol (DBNPG) and tribromoneopentyl alcohol (TBNPA) are brominated flame retardants commonly used as additives during the manufacture of plastic polymers and as chemical intermediates in the synthesis of other flame retardants. Both are classified as not readily biodegradable. In this paper, we demonstrate the biodegradation of both DBNPG and TBNPA by a common bacterial consortium under aerobic conditions in enrichment cultures containing yeast extract. DBNPG and TBNPA biodegradation is accompanied by a release of bromide into the medium, due to a biological debromination reaction. Molecular analysis of the clone library PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene was used to characterize the bacterial consortium involved in the biodegradation. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract = {Synthetic organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, plasticizers, air fuel ingredients and chemical warfare agents. Organophosphorus compounds are the most widely used insecticides, accounting for an estimated 34% of world-wide insecticide sales. Contamination of soil from pesticides as a result of their bulk handling at the farmyard or following application in the field or accidental release may lead occasionally to contamination of surface and ground water. Several reports suggest that a wide range of water and terrestrial ecosystems may be contaminated with organophosphorus compounds. These compounds possess high mammalian toxicity and it is therefore essential to remove them from the environments. In addition, about 200 000 metric tons of nerve (chemical warfare) agents have to be destroyed world-wide under Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). Bioremediation can offer an efficient and cheap option for decontamination of polluted ecosystems and destruction of nerve agents. The first micro-organism that could degrade organophosphorus compounds was isolated in 1973 and identified as Flavobacterium sp. Since then several bacterial and a few fungal species have been isolated which can degrade a wide range of organophosphorus compounds in liquid cultures and soil systems. The biochemistry of organophosphorus compound degradation by most of the bacteria seems to be identical, in which a structurally similar enzyme called organophosphate hydrolase or phosphotriesterase catalyzes the first step of the degradation. organophosphate hydrolase encoding gene opd (organophosphate degrading) gene has been isolated from geographically different regions and taxonomically different species. This gene has been sequenced, cloned in different organisms, and altered for better activity and stability. Recently, genes with similar function but different sequences have also been isolated and characterized. Engineered microorganisms have been tested for their ability to degrade different organophosphorus pollutants, including nerve agents. In this article, we review and propose pathways for degradation of some organophosphorus compounds by microorganisms. Isolation, characterization, utilization and manipulation of the major detoxifying enzymes and the molecular basis of degradation are discussed. The major achievements and technological advancements towards bioremediation of organophosphorus compounds, limitations of available technologies and future challenge are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

abstract = {Organic chemicals discharged in urban wastewater from industrial and domestic sources, or those entering through atmospheric deposition onto paved areas via surface run-off, are predominantly lipophilic in nature and therefore become concentrated in sewage sludge, with potential implications for the agricultural use of sludge as a soil improver. Biodegradation occurs to varying degrees during wastewater and sludge treatment processes. However, residues will probably still be present in the resulting sludge and can vary from trace values of several micrograms per kilogram up to approximately 1 per cent in the dry solids for certain bulk chemicals, such as linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, which is widely used as a surfactant in detergent formulations. However, the review of the scientific literature on the potential environmental and health impacts of organic contaminants (OCs) in sludge indicates that the presence of a compound in sludge, or of seemingly large amounts of certain compounds used in bulk volumes domestically and by industry, does not necessarily constitute a hazard when the material is recycled to farmland. Furthermore, the chemical quality of sludge is continually improving and concentrations of potentially harmful and persistent organic compounds have declined to background values. Thus, recycling sewage sludge on farmland is not constrained by concentrations of OCs found in contemporary sewage sludges. A number of issues, while unlikely to be significant for agricultural utilization, require further investigation and include: (i) the impacts of chlorinated paraffins on the food chain and human health, (ii) the risk assessment of the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a bulk chemical present in large amounts in sludge, (iii) the microbiological risk assessment of antibioticresistant micro-organisms in sewage sludge and sludge-amended agricultural soil, and (iv) the potential significance of personal-care products (e.g. triclosan), pharmaceuticals and endocrine-disrupting compounds in sludge on soil quality and human health. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Stressful parental environments can influence offspring size and development either adaptively or maladaptively, yet little is known about species' differences in this complex aspect of phenotypic plasticity. We performed a reciprocal split-brood experiment to compare transgenerational plasticity in response to drought stress in two closely related annual plant species. We raised inbred replicate parent plants of eight genotypes per species in dry vs. moist soil to generate offspring of each genetic line that differed only in parental environment, then monitored seedling development in both dry and moist conditions. Individuals of the two species expressed contrasting patterns of transgenerational plasticity for traits important to seedling drought tolerance. In Polygonum persicaria, a weedy generalist found in moist, dry, and variably dry sites, drought-stressed plants produced offspring with longer and more rapidly extending root systems and greater biomass when growing in dry soil. In contrast, in P. hydropiper, a non-weedy congener restricted to moist habitats, the offspring of drought-stressed parents had reduced root system development and seedling biomass in dry soil. In P. persicaria, transgenerational and immediate adaptive plasticity combined to produce drought-adapted seedling phenotypes. These results make clear that characteristic patterns of transgenerational plasticity can contribute to ecological diversity among species. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Background and AimsMany Australian legumes have evolved in low-phosphorus (P) soils and low-rainfall areas. Therefore a study was made of the interaction of soil [P] and water availability on growth, photosynthesis, water-use efficiency (WUE) and P nutrition of two Australian native legumes with pasture potential, Cullen australasicum and C. pallidum, and the widely grown exotic pasture legume, lucerne (Medicago sativa). MethodsPlants were grown in a glasshouse at 3, 10 and 30 mg P kg-1 dry soil for 5 months. At week 10, two drought treatments were imposed, total pot dried (all-dry) and only top soil dried (top-dry), while control pots were maintained at field capacity. Key ResultsShoot dry weight produced by lucerne was never higher than that of C. australasicum. For C. pallidum only, shoot dry weight was reduced at 30 mg P kg-1 dry soil. The small root system of the Cullen species was quite plastic, allowing plants to access P and moisture efficiently. Lucerne always had a higher proportion of its large root system in the top soil layer compared with Cullen species. All species showed decreased photosynthesis, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance when exposed to drought, but the reductions were less for Cullen species, due to tighter stomatal control, and consequently they achieved a higher WUE. All species showed highest rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations in the all-dry treatment. For lucerne only, carboxylates decreased as P supply increased. Citrate was the main carboxylate in the control and top-dry treatments, and malate in the all-dry treatment. ConclusionsMultiple adaptive responses of Cullen species and lucerne favoured exploitation of low-P soils under drought. The performance of undomesticated Cullen species, relative to that of lucerne, shows their promise as pasture species for environments such as in south-western Australia where water and P are limiting, especially in view of a predicted drying and warming climate. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

Black-footed and Laysan albatrosses from the North Pacific Ocean contained higher levels of PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs than albatrosses from the Southern Ocean, indicating that emission sources of these contaminants were predominant in the northern hemisphere. Residue levels in albatrosses from the remote North Pacific Ocean far from the point source of pollution were comparable to or higher than those in terrestrial and coastal birds from contaminated areas in developed nations, suggesting the specific exposure and accumulation of PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs in albatross. The long life span and ingestion of plastic resin pellets by albatrosses could be the plausible explanations for the elevated accumulation of persistent and lipophilic contaminants including PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs in these birds. Relative proportions of PCDFs and coplanar PCBs in albatross were higher than those observed in birds inhabiting terrestrial and coastal areas, suggesting that these toxic chemicals may have higher transportability by air and water than PCDDs. Congener patterns of PCDD/Fs in albatross showed less variability as compared to those in terrestrial species, indicating that contamination patterns of PCDD/Fs were similar within the open ocean environment. Contributions of PCDD/Fs to total TEQs in albatrosses from the open ocean were generally lower than those in terrestrial birds, suggesting different toxic potency of PCDD/Fs and coplanar PCBs on animals inhabiting open ocean and terrestrial environment. Whereas albatrosses from southern oceans retained lower TEQ concentrations, possible adverse effects of PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs to black-footed and Laysan albatrosses of the North Pacific Ocean may be suspected from TEQ levels.},

Two-stage survey of 100 households was conducted for dry season and rainy season in 2009. Household solid waste was collected from each household and classified into 10 physical categories and 83 subcategories. The average household solid waste generation rate was 285.28g per capita per day. The compostable and recyclable shares respectively accounted for 80.02% and 11.73%. The authors also analyzed the relations between some socioeconomic factors and household solid waste generation rates by physical categories and subcategories. The household solid waste generation rate per capita per day was positively correlated with the population density and urbanization level, although it was negatively correlated with the household size. The authors also developed mathematical models of correlations between the waste generation rates of main physical categories and relevant factors, such as household size and household income. The models were proposed by linear models with three variables to predict household solid waste generation of total waste, food waste, and plastic waste. It was shown that these correlations were weak and a relationship among variables existed. Comparisons of waste generation by physical compositions associated with different factors, such as seasonal and daily variation were conducted. Results presented that the significant average differences were found by the different seasons and by the different days in a week; although these correlations were weak. The greenhouse gas baseline emission was also calculated as 292.25g (CO2 eq.) per capita per day from biodegradable components. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study was to determine the influence of soil moisture, organic matter amendment and plastic cover (a virtually impermeable film, VIF) on diffusion and emissions of (Z)-and (E)-1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) in microplots of Florida sandy soil (Arredondo fine sand). Upward diffusion of the two isomers in the Arredondo soil without a plastic cover was greatly influenced by soil-water content and (Z)-1,3-D diffused faster than (E)-1,3-D. In less than 5 h after 1,3-D injection to 30 cm depth, (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D in air dry soil had diffused to a 10 cm depth, whereas diffusion for the two isomers was negligible in near-water-saturated soil, even 101 h after injection. The diffusion rate of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D in near-field-capacity soil was between the rates in the two water regimes. Yard waste compost (YWC) amendment greatly reduced diffusion of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D, even in air-dry soil. Although upward diffusion of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D in soil with VIF cover was slightly less than in the corresponding bare soil; the cover promoted retention of vapors of the two isomers in soil pore air in the shallow subsurface. More (Z)-1,3-D vapor was found initially in soil pore air than (E)-1,3-D although the difference declined thereafter. As a result of rapid upward movement in air-dry bare soil, (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D were rapidly volatilized into the atmosphere, but emissions from the near-water-saturated soil were minimal. Virtually impermeable film and YWC amendment retarded emissions. This study indicated that adequate soil water in this sandy soil is needed to prevent rapid emissions, but excess soil water slows diffusion of (Z)- and (E)-1,3-D. Thus, management for optimum water in soil is critical for pesticidal efficacy and the environment. {\textcopyright} 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {Background, Aims and Scope. Research and development has its own benefits and inconveniences. One of the inconveniences is the generation of enormous quantity of diverse toxic and hazardous wastes and its eventual contamination to soil and groundwater resources. Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is one of the commonly used substances in molecular biology experiments. It is highly mutagenic and moderately toxic substance used in DNA-staining during electrophoresis. Interest in phytoremediation as a method to solve chemical contamination has been growing rapidly in recent years. The technology has been utilized to clean up soil and groundwater from heavy metals and other toxic organic compounds in many countries like the United States, Russia, and most of European countries. Phytoremediation requires somewhat limited resources and very useful in treating wide variety of environmental contaminants. This study aimed to assess the potential of selected tropical plants as phytoremediators of EtBr. Materials and Methods. This study used tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), mustard (Brassica alba), vetivergrass (Vetiveria zizanioedes), cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica), carabaograss (Paspalum conjugatum), and talahib (Saccharum spontaneum) to remove EtBr from laboratory wastes. The six tropical plants were planted in individual plastic bags containing soil and 10% EtBr-stained agarose gel. The plants were allowed to establish and grow in soil for 30 days. Ethidium bromide content of the test plants and the soil were analyzed before and after soil treatment. Ethidium bromide contents of the plants and soils were analyzed using an UV VIS spectrophotometer. Results. Results showed a highly significant (p≤0.001) difference in the ability of the tropical plants to absorb EtBr from soils. Mustard registered the highest absorption of EtBr (1.4±0.12 pg kg -1) followed by tomato and vetivergrass with average uptake of 1.0±0.23 and 0.7±0.17 $\mu$g kg-1 EtBr, respectively. Cogongrass, talahib, and carabaograss had the least amount of EtBr absorbed (0.2±0.6 pg kg-1). Ethidium bromide content of soil planted to mustard was reduced by 10.7%. This was followed by tomato with an average reduction of 8.1%. Only 5.6% reduction was obtained from soils planted to vetivergrass. Soils planted to cogongrass, talahib, and carabaograss had the least reduction of 1.52% from its initial EtBr content. Discussion. In this study, mustard, tomato, and vetivergrass have shown their ability to absorb EtBr from contaminated soil keeping them from expanding their reach into the environment and preventing further contamination. Its downside, however, is that living creatures including humans, fish, and birds, must be prevented from eating the plants that utilized these substances. Nonetheless, it is still easier to isolate, cut down, and remove plants growing on the surface of the contaminated matrices, than to use strong acids and permanganates to chemically neutralize a dangerous process that can further contaminate the environment and pose additional risks to humans. Though this alternative method does not totally eliminate eventual environmental contamination, it is by far produces extremely insignificant amount of by-products compared with the existing processes and technologies. Conclusions. Mustard had the highest potential as phytoremediator of EtBr in soil. However, the absorption capabilities of the other test plants may also be considered in terms of period of maturity and productivity. Recommendations and Perspectives. It is recommended that a more detailed and complete investigation of the phytoremediation properties of the different plants tested should be conducted in actual field experiments. Plants should be exposed until they reach maturity to establish their maximum response to the toxicity and mutagenecity of EtBr and their maximum absorbing capabilities. Different plant parts should be analyzed individually to determine the movement and translocation of EtBr from soil to the tissues of plants. Since this study has established that some plants can thrive and dwell in EtBr-treated soil, an increased amount of EtBr application should be explored in future studies. It is suggested therefore that a larger, more comprehensive exploration of phytoremediation application in the management of toxic and hazardous wastes emanating from biotechnology research activities should be considered especially on the use of vetivergrass, a very promising tropical perennial grass. {\textcopyright} 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe H{\"{u}}thig Jehle Rehm GmbH).},

abstract = {An assessment of the effect of the composting potential of Mater-Bi biodegradable plastic with green wastes, noted by GBIO, and degradable plastic (PDQ-H additive) with green wastes, noted by GDEG, was carried out in a lagged two-compartment compost reactor. The composting time was determined until constant mass of the composting substrates was reached. The green wastes composting process was used as control (G). After one week of composting, the biodegradable plastics disappeared completely, while 2% of the original degradable plastic still remained after about 8 weeks of composting. A net reduction in volatile solids contents of 61.8%, 56.5% and 53.2% were obtained for G, GBIO and GDEG, respectively. Compost quality was assessed in terms of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus contents, which were found to be highest for GBIO compost. From the phytotoxicity test, it has been observed that a diluted extract of GBIO compost has produced the longest length of radicle. From the respiration test, no significant difference in the amount of carbon dioxide released by the composting of GDEG and G was observed. This study showed that the quality of the compost is not affected by the presence of the biodegradable and degradable plastics in the raw materials. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Interacting effects of high light and drought on the performance of sun and shade phenotypes were experimentally undertaken following survival, chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange in 2-year-old saplings of four Mediterranean trees (Quercus ilex and Q. coccifera as water-saving species, and Pistacia lentiscus and P. terebinthus as water-spending species). Half of the saplings were grown in full sunlight and the other half in the shade (6% sunlight). Half of each combination of species-phenotype was exposed to high light during a simulated late-summer drought. Light absorptance and gas exchange were scaled up to the whole plant with the 3-D geometrical model, Y-Plant. Quercus species were more plastic and tolerated high light and water stress better than Pistacia species, surviving longer and in drier soils, and exhibiting a less pronounced photoinhibition. There was no evidence of disadvantage for shade phenotypes under high light with increasing drought. By contrast, shade phenotypes survived longer despite larger initial decreases in photochemical efficiency and higher sensitivity to drought than sun phenotypes. The enhanced control of transpiration during drought in water-saving versus water-spending species (and also in shade versus sun phenotypes in three out of the four species) allowed extended survival. Photoinhibition reduced whole crown carbon gain in high light by c. 3% and affected significantly more the shaded leaves of a given plant (reducing their carbon gain by up to 7%) than those exposed to direct sunlight. Despite this apparently minor impact, whole plant carbon gain reduction by photoinhibition negatively correlated with survival and drought tolerance. The implications for succession and forest regeneration in arid environments, particularly under a global change scenario, are discussed.},

abstract = {A major route of exposure to hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs), such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), is ingestion. Matrix-bound HOCs may become bioavailable after mobilization by the gastrointestinal fluids followed by sorption to the intestinal epithelium. The purpose of this research was to measure the bioavailability of [14C]-BaP bound to pristine soils or field-contaminated sediment using an in vitro model of gastrointestinal digestion followed by sorption to human enterocytes (Caco-2 cells) or to a surrogate membrane, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) thin film. Although Caco-2 cells had a twofold higher lipid-normalized fugacity capacity than EVA, [ 14C]-BaP uptake by Caco-2 lipids and EVA thin film demonstrated a linear relationship within the range of BaP concentrations tested. These results suggest that EVA thin film is a good membrane surrogate for passive uptake of BaP. The in vitro system provided enough sensitivity to detect matrix effects on bioavailability; after 5 h, significantly lower concentrations of [ 14C]-BaP were sorbed into Caco-2 cells from soil containing a higher percentage of organic matter compared to soil with a lower percentage of organic matter. The [14C]-BaP desorption rate from Caco-2 lipids consistently was twofold higher than from EVA thin film for all matrices tested. The more rapid kinetics observed with Caco-2 cells probably were due to the greater surface area available for absorption/desorption in the cells. After 5 h, the uptake of BaP into Caco-2 lipid was similar in live and metabolically inert Caco-2 cells, suggesting that the primary route of BaP uptake is by passive diffusion. Moreover, the driving force for uptake is the fugacity gradient that exists between the gastrointestinal fluid and the membrane. {\textcopyright} 2007 SETAC.},

Only two kinetic parameters - the first-order rate coefficient k describing the overall kinetics of the process and the coefficient $\alpha$ characterizing the fraction of non-degradable DEHP - were used to fit the array of experimental data published earlier. The values of k and $\alpha$ estimated for DEHP removal from different sludges at 35 °C varied within the range of 0.03-0.07 d-1 and 0.25-0.5, respectively. In sludge-amended soil, the first-order kinetic coefficient k increased from 0.007 to 0.028 d-1 and the fraction of non-degradable DEHP $\alpha$ decreased from 0.6 to 0.5 with the increase in incubation temperature from 5 to 20 °C.

abstract = {A former agrichemical dealership in western Nebraska was suspected of having contaminated soil. Our objective was to characterize and remediate the contaminated site by a combined chemical-biological approach. This was accomplished by creating contour maps of the on-site contamination, placing the top 60 cm of contaminated soil in windrows and mixing with a mechanical high-speed mixer. Homogenized soil containing both atrazine [6-chloro-N-ethyl- N′-isopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine] and cyanazine {2-[[4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl] amino]-2-methylpropanenitrile} was then used in laboratory investigations to determine optimum treatments for pesticide destruction. Iron suspension experiments verified that zerovalent iron (Fe0) plus ferrous sulfate (FeSO4{\textperiodcentered}7H2O) removed more than 90% of both atrazine and cyanazine within 14 d. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of the atrazine solution after treating with Fe0 and ferrous sulfate identified several degradation products commonly associated with biodegradation (i.e., deethlyatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA), hydroxyatrazine (HA), and ammelines). Biological treatment evaluated emulsified soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] oil (EOS) as a carbon source to stimulate biodegradation in static soil microcosms. Combining emulsified soybean oil with the chemical amendments resulted in higher destruction efficiencies (80-85%) and reduced the percentage of FeSO4 needed. This chemical-biological treatment (Fe0 + FeSO4 + EOS, EOS Remediation, Raleigh, NC) was then applied with water to 275 m 3 of contaminated soil in the field. Windrows were tightly covered with clear plastic to increase soil temperature and maintain soil water content. Temporal sampling (0-342 d) revealed atrazine and cyanazine concentrations decreased by 79 to 91%. These results provide evidence that a combined chemical-biological approach can be used for on-site, field-scale treatment of pesticide-contaminated soil.

abstract = {Polyacrylamide (PAM), a linear water soluble polymeric compound with high molecular weight, is extensively used for oil production in China. Compared with the physico-chemical degradation of PAM, there is no acrylamide monomer, which causes peripheral neuropathy, released in the process of biodegradation. Unfortunately, few microorganisms have been isolated which can degrade PAM. In this study, two PAM-degrading bacterial strains, named HWBI and HWBII, were isolated from the activated sludge and soil in an oil field that had been contaminated by PAM for an extended period. These were subsequently identified as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus flexu, respectively. Both strains grew on a medium composed of 60 mg L-1 PAM as the sole source of carbon. Although both strains degraded PAM in different rates, after 72 h cultivation more than 70% of the PAM was consumed. This degradation efficiency was much higher than previous studies. Both strains degraded a determinate proportion of PAM when 50-1000 mg L-1 of the initial PAM was supplied. Glucose with a concentration lower than 200 mg L-1 can be used as co-metabolism substrate with PAM. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrograms of the cultures before and after PAM degradation were also recorded. The result showed that amido groups of the PAM were picked off by the microorganisms from the main chain of the PAM, and metabolism products other than acrylamide were formed in the degradation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Biosecure (plastic-wrapped) compost structures were built containing 16 cattle carcasses placed on 40 cm straw and covered with 160-cm of feedlot manure. Compost was collected from depths of 80 and 160 cm (P80, P160) and DNA degradation assessed over 147 days of static composting, and during 180 days of active composting. Residual soft tissues from carcasses were collected on day 147. At P80, copies of a 171-bp bovine mitochondrial DNA (Mt171) and 138-bp plant Rubisco gene fragment (Rub138) were reduced compared to initial copy numbers (CN) by 79% and 99% after 147 days, respectively. At P160, Mt171, and Rub138 decreased compared to initial CN by 20% and 99% by day 147, respectively. After 327 days, degradation of Mt171 increased to 91% compared to initial CN. Compared to fresh tissues, residual tissues at day 147 had a 99% reduction in genomic DNA yield. Yield of DNA was related to copies of a 760-bp bovine mitochondrial fragment (Mt760) which were <93% reduced at both P80 and P160 after 147 day. Secondary composting improved decomposition of bovine tissues and Mt760 was not detectable after 207 days. A 99% reduction in genomic DNA of composted tissue and <93% reduction of Mt760 suggests almost complete decomposition of carcass soft tissue after 147 days. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

The optimum pH, temperature, and salinity for the BBP biodegradation were 7.0, 37°C, and 15 g L-1, respectively. BBP was completely degraded within 6 days under optimum conditions, and the biodegradation of BBP could be fitted to a first-order kinetic model.

The top layer soil (0-10 cm) of plots was treated with a mixture of DBP and DEHP (1:1 w/w) and capsicum seedlings were transplanted. After 90 days, capsicum fruit, shoot and root samples were collected. DBP and DEHP concentration in various parts of the samples were determined by gas chromatography. Vitamin C and capsaicin contents in fruit were determined using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine colorimetric analysis and sodium nitrite-sodium molybdate colorimetric analysis, respectively. The results showed that DBP concentration in fruit, shoot and root increased with the increase of soil-applied DBP/DEHP concentration, but DEHP was not detected in all samples. When the soil-applied DBP/DEHP concentration was 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg kg-1 soil, compared with control, vitamin C and capsaicin content in capsicum fruit decreased by 1.6%, 5.9%, 10.6%, 18.2%, 19.2%, 22.6% and 1.6%, 2.5%, 12.9%, 20.1%, 22.2%, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that the decrease of vitamin C and capsaicin content was negatively correlated to the increase of DBP concentration in capsicum fruit, which suggested that DBP uptake by the plant might be mainly responsible for quality degradation of capsicum fruit. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The differences in phenotypic plasticity between invasive (North American) and native (German) provenances of the invasive plant Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) were examined using a multivariate reaction norm approach testing two important attributes of reaction norms described by multivariate vectors of phenotypic change: the magnitude and direction of mean trait differences between environments. Data were collected for six life history traits from native and invasive plants using a split-plot design with experimentally manipulated water and nutrient levels. We found significant differences between native and invasive plants in multivariate phenotypic plasticity for comparisons between low and high water treatments within low nutrient levels, between low and high nutrient levels within high water treatments, and for comparisons that included both a water and nutrient level change. The significant genotype x environment (G x E) effects support the argument that invasiveness of purple loosestrife is closely associated with the interaction of high levels of soil nutrient and flooding water regime. Our results indicate that native and invasive plants take different strategies for growth and reproduction; native plants flowered earlier and allocated more to flower production, while invasive plants exhibited an extended period of vegetative growth before flowering to increase height and allocation to clonal reproduction, which may contribute to increased fitness and invasiveness in subsequent years. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},
