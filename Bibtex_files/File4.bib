abstract = {The elution of antibiotics from antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads was measured in mongrel dogs. The antibiotics, used in mixture with Simplex cement, included cefazolin (Ancef; 4.5 g/40 g cement powder), ciprofloxacin (Cipro; 6 g/40 g powder), clindamycin (Cleocin; 6 g/40 g powder), ticarcillin (Ticar; 12 g/40 g powder), tobramycin (Nebcin; 9.8 g/40 g powder), and vancomycin (Vancocin; 4 g/40 g powder). After a pneumatic drill was used to dredge a trough in the tibia, five beads were implanted. During the next 28 days, seroma samples and serum samples were taken for antibiotic measurements. On Day 28, the dogs were killed, beads removed, and the seroma, serum, bone, and granulation tissue sampled. The results of the study showed that clindamycin, vancomycin, and tobramycin exhibited good elution characteristics and had consistently high levels in bone and granulation tissue.},

abstract = {A rapid and gentle procedure for preparing demembranated, cytosol-free sperm models was applied to fowl spermatozoa. Intact spermatozoa were introduced to a Triton X-100-containing extraction medium layered on top of a discontinuous Percoll gradient in a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. After brief exposure to the extraction medium, spermatozoa were separated from the plasma membrane and detergent-soluble components by centrifugation through a 55% Percoll layer, finally collecting on top of a 90% Percoll cushion from where they were recovered. Optimum conditions consisted of a Triton X-100 concentration in the extraction medium of 0.15%, duration of demembranation time of 1.5 min and ATP concentration in the reactivation medium of 0.5 mM. Demembranated sperm models obtained by this procedure could be reactivated, and the motility at 30°C was more than 60%, but negligible at 40°C. These values were similar to those obtained from the conventional method, in which centrifugation is not carried out, and which results in some of the cytosolic components being transferred to the reactivation medium along with the spermatozoa. Inhibition of motility was observed following the addition of EGTA or myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) substrate peptide at 30°C, whilst the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors, such as calyculin A or okadaic acid, permitted the restoration of motility at 40°C. These results demonstrate that the axoneme and/or accessory cytoskeletal components are directly involved in the temperature-dependent regulatory system of fowl sperm motility in the absence of plasma membrane and/or soluble components of cytoplasm.},

In confirmation of earlier studies, fast growth was associated with faster rates of feeding, reduced metabolic rates and lower metabolic costs of growth. Selected individuals deposited more protein, at a lower metabolic cost, than the controls. Control oysters, however, deposited more lipid than the selected oysters, though the unit costs of lipid deposition did not differ between categories. The results indicated a wide plasticity of physiological rates and efficiencies and demonstrated how, by selection, interactions between physiological traits can serve to enhance growth. If differences in lipid deposition observed here were indicative of different rates of gametogenesis, then the results also suggest that selection alters the balance between growth and reproduction. Whether these differences can be termed compensatory with respect to the life history of the species remains to be determined, but the results indicate some of the ways in which physiological flexibility may be expressed to effect different patterns of energy allocation.},

abstract = {Marine mussels are used as bioindicators of water pollution in marine and estuarine environments in the so-called 'Mussel Watch' programs because of their capacity to accumulate numerous organic xenobiotics including aromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, we have analyzed the effects of two xenobiotics [benzo(a)pyrene and the water accommodated fraction of a lubricant oil] and two typical (rodent) peroxisome proliferators (clofibrate and dioctyl phthalate) on structure and function of peroxisomes in digestive glands of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, either following water exposure (for 1, 7, and 21 days) or after direct injection through the adductor muscle (for 1 and 7 days). The activities of catalase (CAT), acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX), and D-amino acid oxidase were determined in whole homogenates of digestive glands. In addition, stereological methods were applied on sections stained histochemically for demonstration of catalase activity in order to quantify the morphological changes of peroxisomes. The peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase and D-amino acid oxidase were increased in mussels injected for 7 days with benzo(a)pyrene, phthalate, and clofibrate and a similar trend was noted for benzo(a)pyrene and lubricant oil in water exposure experiments (21 days). The catalase activity was reduced or unchanged depending on the mode of exposure of animals. By stereology, significant increases of numerical and volume densities of peroxisomes were found in animals injected for 7 days with lubricant oil or clofibrate. These observations indicate that peroxisomal oxidases in mussels are induced at moderate rates in response to different xenobiotics and that their determination could provide a (sensitive) marker for detection of effects of some toxic pollutants, particularly the lubricant oils which in addition induce significant structural alterations of mussel peroxisomes.},

abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in chronic pain states in which the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. To begin to explore possible mechanisms, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide confined to fine primary afferent terminals in laminae I and II in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and implicated in pain transmission, was selected. Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of CGRP in the spinal cord following T-13 spinal cord hemisection in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats compared to that seen in sham controls. Spinal cords from both hemisected and sham control groups (N = 5, per time point) were examined on postoperative day (POD) 3, 5, 7, 14, and 108 following surgery. Sham operated rats displayed CGRP immunoreaction product in laminae I and II outer, Lissauer's tract, dorsal roots, and motor neurons of the ventral horn. In the hemisected group, densiometric data demonstrated an increased deposition of reaction product that was statistically significant, in laminae III and IV, both ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion that extended at least two segments rostral and caudal to the hemisection site by POD 14, and remained significantly elevated as long as POD 108. Since upregulation alone of CGRP would occur in an acute temporal window (by 2 to 8 days following spinal injury), these results are interpreted to be invasion of laminae III and IV by sprouting of CGRP containing fine primary afferents. Intrathecal delivery of antibodies against purified 2.5S nerve growth factor for 14 days to the hemisected group resulted in CGRP density in laminae I through IV that was significantly less than that seen in untreated or vehicle treated hemisected groups and to sham controls. These data indicate changes in density and distribution of CGRP following spinal hemisection that can be manipulated by changes in endogenous levels of NGF. These observations suggest possible strategies for intervention in the development of various pain states in human SCI.},

Phase I effluent toxicity characterization tests revealed that treatment of the effluent with a cation exchange resin (Amberlite{\textregistered} IR-120 Plus) was partially effective at reducing, but not removing, toxicity. Phase II characterization tests revealed that four cartons varied with toxicity: Ca and Sn were positively correlated with increasing toxicity; Mg and K were negatively correlated with increasing toxicity. Toxicity tests with SnCl2 revealed that the toxicity threshold for Sn was far above the concentrations present in the raw effluent. Reduction of Ca was shown to result in a significant improvement in survival, but some toxicity still remained. Further augmentation of the treated effluent with CaCl2, MgCl2, and KBr to restore the concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, and Br to natural seawater concentrations resulted in survival of all exposed organisms. Repeated success of this treatment regime on additional samples of the effluent as well as 'mock effluent' studies confirmed that ion imbalance was the sole source of toxicity in this effluent.

These results suggest that the PKC action on I(Gly) is conditional upon the modulation of the currents by PKA and vice versa. This cross-regulation of ligand-gated channel activity by protein kinases may play a role in neuronal integration and synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Petroleum-based products are the major source of energy for industry and daily life. Petroleum is also the raw material for many chemical products such as plastics, paints, and cosmetics. The transport of petroleum across the world is frequent, and the amounts of petroleum stocks in developed countries are enormous. Consequently, the potential for oil spills is significant, and research on the fate of petroleum in a marine environment is important to evaluate the environmental threat of oil spills, and to develop biotechnology to cope with them. Crude oil is constituted from thousands of components which are separated into saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. Upon discharge into the sea, crude oil is subjected to weathering, the process caused by the combined effects of physical, chemical and biological modification. Saturates, especially those of smaller molecular weight, are readily biodegraded in marine environments. Aromatics with one, two or three aromatic rings are also efficiently biodegraded; however, those with four or more aromatic ring are quite resistant to biodegradation. The asphaltene and resin fractions contain higher molecular weight compounds whose chemical structures have not yet been resolved. The biodegradability of these compounds is not yet known. It is known that the concentrations of available nitrogen and phosphorus in seawater limit the growth and activities of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms in a marine environment. In other words, the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to an oil-contaminated marine environment can stimulate the biodegradation of spilled oil. This notion was confirmed in the large-scale operation for bioremediation after the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska. Many microorganisms capable of degrading petroleum components have been isolated. However, few of them seem to be important for petroleum biodegradation in natural environments. One group of bacteria belonging to the genus Alcanivorax does become predominant in an oil-contaminated marine environment, especially when nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers are added to stimulate the growth of endogenous microorganisms.},

abstract = {The development of a simplified and modified procedure for the assessment of ciguatoxin (CTX) and related polyethers from ciguateric contaminated fish tissues is presented in this study. The previous method, stick-enzyme immunoassay (S-EIA) used an organic correction fluid-coated bamboo paddle stick for the solid phase; this new procedure, membrane immunobead assay (MIA), uses a plastic stick with a synthetic membrane laminated onto one end. The membrane is hydrophobic and serves as the solid-phase receptor for the binding of methanol-extracted CTX or its related polyether lipids from fish tissues. Detection of the bound polyether toxin(s) on the membrane is carried out with colored polystyrene beads coated with monoclonal antibody to CTX (MAb-CTX). Intensity of the color on the membrane is proportional to the amount of toxic polyethers on the membrane. The MIA is compared with previous procedures developed for CTX detection (S-EIA and solid-phase immunobead assay, SPIA) using State of Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) implicated ciguateric fishes, and reef fishes from Hawaii and Kwajalein. The data presented show good correlation between the three test systems, especially with ciguatera implicated fish and toxic, routinely assessed fishes in the mouse toxicity (MT) bioassay. Variations between MT results and those of the S-EIA, SPIA, and MIA of routine fishes are generally attributable to diverse toxins present in the fish species examined. The MIA is a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific detection method for CTX and its related polyethers, with no reported false negative results. The test is useful for field and personal use and can be adapted to the laboratory for large-scale screening of potentially ciguateric fishes.},

abstract = {The search for biocompatible materials that can support the growth and phenotypic expression of osteoblasts and chondrocytes is a major challenge in the application of tissue engineering techniques for the repair of bone and cartilage defects. Chitosan, a copolymer of glucosamine and N- acetylglucosamine, may provide an answer to this search. Chitosan is the deacetylated product of chitin, a ubiquitous biopolymer found in the exoskeleton of insects and marine invertebrates. Little is known about the utility of chitosan in propagating human osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In this study, we test the hypothesis that chitosan promotes the survival and function of osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Chitosan (4%, w/v in 2% HAc) was coated onto plastic coverslips that had been fitted into 24-well plates. Human osteoblasts and articular chondrocytes were seeded on either uncoated or chitosan-coated coverslips at 1 x 105/cells per well. Cultures were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for a period of 7 days. Cell viability was assessed at that time using a fluorescent molecular probe. The phenotypic expression of osteoblasts and chondrocytes was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry. Osteoblasts and chondrocytes appeared spherical and refractile on chitosan-coated coverslips. In contrast, greater than 90% of cells on plastic coverslips were elongated and spindle shaped after 7 days of culture. Similar to cells propagated on uncoated control wells, greater than 90% of human osteoblasts and chondrocytes propagated on chitosan remained viable. Human osteoblasts propagated on chitosan films continued to express collagen type I whereas chondrocytes expressed collagen type II and aggrecan, as shown by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunostaining. The present in vitro work demonstrates the biocompatibility of chitosan as a substrate for the growth and continued function of human osteoblasts and chondrocytes. Chitosan may have potential use as a tissue engineering tool for the repair of osseous and chondral defects. (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Hydrolysis-resistant activation of G-proteins by extracellular perfusion of fluoride ions was examined in Type B cells isolated from the cerebral ganglion of the marine mollusc Hermissenda. Under single-electrode voltage-clamp, modulation by aluminum fluoride ions of several classes of outward K+ currents as well as an inward Ca2+ current was observed. Following injection of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, aluminum fluoride ions selectively increased a slow, voltage-dependent K+ current (I(K) within 5 min of application, while in the absence of EGTA, aluminum fluoride ions induced a small, transient reduction of I(K). Neither the magnitude nor steady-state inactivation of a fast, voltage-dependent K+ current (I(A)), nor a slow, Ca2+-dependent K+ current (I(K-Ca)), were affected by aluminum fluoride ions. In contrast, when perfusion of aluminum fluoride ions was accompanied by a repetitive depolarization and a concomitant increase in intracellular Ca2+, both I(A) and the combined late currents (I(K) and I(K-Ca)) were markedly reduced, a reduction which was not observed following depolarization alone or if the pairing of aluminum fluoride ions and depolarization was preceded by an injection of EGTA. The reduction of membrane conductance by the pairing of aluminum fluoride ions with depolarization could not be accounted for by an increased Ca2+ conductance, as aluminum fluoride ions produced only a small decrease in the voltage-dependent Ca2+ current. In total, these results indicate that regulatory G-proteins may bidirectionally modulate neuronal K+ currents, the direction of which is dependent on intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Such a dual regulatory mechanism may contribute to the modulation of membrane excitability observed when presynaptic activity is paired with postsynaptic depolarization, and thus may contribute to some forms of activity-dependent plasticity involving metabatropic receptors.},

abstract = {Phthalate esters (PEs) are an important class of industrial chemicals for which an extensive aquatic toxicity database is available. The objectives of this study were to use these data to develop quantitative structure- activity relationships (QSARs) that describe aquatic toxicity for different freshwater and marine species, gain insights into toxicity mechanisms, and calculate PE water quality criteria using statistical extrapolation procedures. Results for low-molecular-weight PEs with log K(ow) < 6 indicate that toxicity data conform to a simple log K(ow)-dependent QSAR. Fish were found to be more sensitive than algae while invertebrates spanned a wide range in toxicological response. Freshwater and marine species demonstrated a similar distribution of sensitivities. Comparison of species-dependent QSARs supports the hypothesis that biotransformation plays an important role in explaining toxicity differences observed between species. Estimated critical body residues (CBRs) for parent PE in fish were in the range reported for other polar organic chemicals while CBRs for parent PE plus associated metabolites were in the range reported for nonpolar narcotics (i.e., baseline toxicity) suggesting a possible putative role of PE metabolites. Depending on extrapolation procedure and assumptions, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and butybenzyl phthalate ranged from 3109 to 4780, 865 to 1173, 43 to 62, and 38 to 60 $\mu$g l-1, respectively. PNECs derived using this approach provide a transparent technical basis to support aquatic risk assessment for low-molecular-weight PEs. Results for high-molecular-weight PEs (log K(ow) > 6) indicate that these chemicals are not acutely or chronically toxic to freshwater or marine organisms due to the combined role of low water solubility and limited bioconcentration potential which precludes attainment of internal concentrations that are required to elicit adverse effects. It is concluded that attempts to establish aquatic PNECs for high-molecular-weight PEs are not scientifically defensible. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

Comparison of species-dependent QSARs supports the hypothesis that biotransformation plays an important role in explaining toxicity differences observed between species. Estimated critical body residues (CBRs) for parent PE in fish were in the range reported for other polar organic chemicals while CBRs for parent PE plus associated metabolites were in the range reported for nonpolar narcotics (i.e., baseline toxicity) suggesting a possible putative role of PE metabolites. Depending on extrapolation procedure and assumptions, predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and butybenzyl phthalate ranged from 3109 to 4780, 865 to 1173, 43 to 62, and 38 to 60 $\mu$g l-1, respectively. PNECs derived using this approach provide a transparent technical basis to support aquatic risk assessment for low-molecular-weight PEs. Results for high-molecular-weight PEs (log K(ow) > 6) indicate that these chemicals are not acutely or chronically toxic to freshwater or marine organisms due to the combined role of low water solubility and limited bioconcentration potential which precludes attainment of internal concentrations that are required to elicit adverse effects. It is concluded that attempts to establish aquatic PNECs for high-molecular-weight PEs are not scientifically defensible. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {A basic question in studies of the neurobiology of aging is to what extent age-related changes are genetically preprogrammed or epigenetically mediated. Our approach to this question is to compare the effect of age on two neural pathways in the marine mollusc, Aplysia. The advantage of Aplysia as a model of neural aging is that age-sensitive properties in the pathways can be studied at the behavioral, physiological, and morphological levels. The two pathways we are investigating respond differently to aging; a comparison of the pathways' properties provides a means of distinguishing the effect of age from other variables in the same animal. Age effects are expressed in the gill withdrawal reflex pathway at the three levels but are minimal in the gill respiratory pathway. The behavioral and physiological expressions of the reflex pathway are weakened in old animals (250 days of age and older) when compared to those in mature ones (ca. 160 days of age). The major differences between the two pathways are: (1) the reflex pathway appears to exhibit more plasticity than the respiratory pathway, and (2) the level of use of the respiratory pathway is more regular and frequent than that of the reflex pathway. The greater plasticity intrinsic to the reflex pathway and its level of use may well be the characteristics upon which age-related changes depend. An interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors is suggested to help explain the differential aging in the two pathways. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Of the intracellular compartments involved in Ca2+ clearance, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has received the most attention because it expresses Ca2+ pumps and Ca2+ channels, thus endowing it with the potential to act as both an intracellular calcium sink and store. We review here our ongoing work on the role of calcium sequestration into, and release from, ER cisterns and the role that this plays in the generation and termination of free [Ca2+](i) transients in dendrites of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices during and after synaptic activity. These studies have been approached by combining parallel microfluorometric measurements of free cytosolic [Ca2+](i) transients with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalytical measurements of total Ca content within specific dendritic compartments at the electron microscopy level. Our observations support the emerging realization that specific subsets of dendritic ER cisterns provide spatial and temporal microheterogeneity of Ca2+ signalling, acting not only as a major intracellular Ca sink involved in active clearance mechanisms after voltage- and ligand-gated Ca2+ influx, but also as an intracellular Ca2+ source that can be mobilized by a signal cascade originating at activated synapses.},

However, the possibility that type B photoreceptors also exhibit synaptic plasticity has not previously been explored. We now report that connections of type B photoreceptors onto type A photoreceptors exhibit synaptic facilitation, and that this facilitation involves the same first messenger (5-HT) and second messenger (protein kinase C) previously implicated in the learning-produced excitability changes. In brief, we found that application of 5-HT dramatically facilitates synaptic potentials evoked by type B cells in type A cell cells, and that this facilitation is blocked by preincubation with staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C also induces synaptic facilitation, whereas activation of the cAMP- dependent protein kinase has no effect. Changes in synaptic strength produced by these manipulations are paralleled by changes in type B cell input resistance (a simple index of cellular excitability), whereas type A cell input resistance is unaffected. These findings indicate a previously unrecognized form of neuronal plasticity in Hermissenda that may contribute importantly to the learned changes in behavior, and thereby highlight general principles of learning-related neuronal plasticity shared by different preparations and species.},

The pvaB gene encoded a protein of 379 amino acid residues (40610 Da), and a lipoprotein signal sequence and the lipase consensus sequence, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, characteristic of the active-site serine region in serine hydrolases, were detected in the deduced amino acid sequence.

Control animals received normal diet and plain water. During the treatment rats were weighed every week and water consumption per day was measured. After the completion of treatment, liver weight/body weight, liver weight, body weight, serum enzymes and other biochemical parameters were assessed. It was found that there was no significant change observed in body weight, liver weight, liver weight/body weight and water consumption.

abstract = {In the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, serotonin initiates three phases of translational regulation: an initial decrease in translation, followed by a transient increase in protein synthesis, both of which are independent of transcription, followed by a later increase in protein synthesis that is dependent on transcription. These increases in protein synthesis may underlie translation-dependent changes in synaptic plasticity. We have characterized the second messenger pathways that underlie these changes in the pleural ganglia of Aplysia. Activation of protein kinase C was both necessary and sufficient for the initial decrease in translation. Protein kinase C, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and a tyrosine kinase were all required for the second phase, a transient increase in protein synthesis. The late increase in protein synthesis required both protein kinase A and spaced applications of serotonin. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of a downstream translational regulator, blocked the transient increase in protein synthesis (second phase), suggesting that this drug may be useful in determining the specific physiological consequences of this translational regulation. Indeed, we used rapamycin to demonstrate that one type of intermediate form of synaptic plasticity induced by serotonin did not require the rapamycin-sensitive increase in translation.},

abstract = {A new method, the turgor clamp, was developed to test the effects of turgor on cell enlargement. The method used a pressure probe to remove or inject cell solution and change the turgor without altering the external environment of the cell walls. After the injections, the cells were permanently at the new turgor and required no further manipulation. Internode cells of Chara corallina grew rapidly with the pressure probe in place when growth was monitored with a position transducer. Growth-induced water potentials were negligible and turgor effects could be studied simply. As turgor was decreased, there was a threshold below which no growth occurred, and only reversible elastic/viscoelastic changes could be seen. Above the threshold, growth was superimposed on the elastic/viscoelastic effects. The rate of growth did not depend on turgor. Instead, the rate was highly dependent on energy metabolism as shown by inhibitors that rapidly abolished growth without changing the turgor. However, turgors could be driven above the maximum normally attainable by the cell, and these caused growth to respond as though plastic deformation of the walls was beginning, but the deformation caused wounding. Growth was inhibited when turgor was changed with osmotica but not inhibited when similar changes were made with the turgor clamp. It was concluded that osmotica caused side effects that could be mistaken for turgor effects. The presence of a turgor threshold indicates that turgor was required for growth. However, because turgor did not control the rate, it appears incorrect to consider the rate to be determined by a turgor-dependent plastic deformation of wall polymers. Instead, above the turgor threshold, the rapid response to energy inhibitors suggests a control by metabolic reactions causing synthesis and/or extension of wall polymers.},

abstract = {Teleost sex change is an important model to understand general principles of sexual differentiation and plasticity in the adult brain. The present study is the first to examine the proliferation zones in the adult brain of males, females and sex-changing individuals of a protandrous teleost species (Sparus aurata), by means of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine immunocytochemistry. Postnatal neurogenesis in the marine teleost brain was found in ventricular and subventricular areas of the brain that in most cases coincided with the embryonic proliferation zones. The molecular layer of corpus and valvula cerebelli exhibited the highest mitotic activity in the adult brain. High mitotic activity was observed in the hypothalamic, thalamic and telencephalic ventricular areas, as well as the dorsal and ventral rim of the optic tectum. Most of the labeled cells were elongated, indicating the initiation of migratory activity. There were no qualitative differences in the distribution of proliferation zones between the sex phases studied with the exception of the ventricular region of the dorsal hypothalamic area. Volume fraction analysis of the area occupied by the labeled cells suggested that this region included higher densities of newborn cells in the female animals. The proliferation pattern in the adult gilthead sea bream brain is in agreement with the hypothesis of the continuous generation of new cells in the teleost brain. Moreover, our data propose that cell proliferation differences possibly existing in the ventricular region of the dorsal hypothalamus between sexual phases, might be involved in central mechanisms of sexual plasticity in protandrous hermaphrodite teleosts.
