abstract = {Experimental observations on synaptic plasticity at individual glutamatergic synapses from the CA3 Shaffer collateral pathway onto CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus suggest that the transitions in synaptic strength occur among discrete levels at individual synapses [C. C. H. Petersen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 4732 (1998); O'Connor, Wittenberg, and Wang, D. H. O'Connor, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (to be published); J. M. Montgomery and D. V. Madison, Trends Neurosci. 27, 744 (2004)]. This happens for both long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) induction protocols. O'Connor, Wittenberg, and Wang have argued that three states would account for their observations on individual synapses in the CA3-CA1 pathway. We develop a quantitative model of this three-state system with transitions among the states determined by a competition between kinases and phosphatases shown by D. H. O'Connor, to be determinant of LTP and LTD, respectively. Specific predictions for various plasticity protocols are given by coupling this description of discrete synaptic $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor ligand gated ion channel conductance changes to a model of postsynaptic membrane potential and associated intracellular calcium fluxes to yield the transition rates among the states. We then present various LTP and LTD induction protocols to the model system and report the resulting whole cell changes in AMPA conductance. We also examine the effect of our discrete state synaptic plasticity model on the synchronization of realistic oscillating neurons. We show that one-to-one synchronization is enhanced by the plasticity we discuss here and the presynaptic and postsynaptic oscillations are in phase. Synaptic strength saturates naturally in this model and does not require artificial upper or lower cutoffs, in contrast to earlier models of plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Variations in people's vulnerability to stressful life events may rise from a predated neural sensitivity as well as from differential neural modifications in response to the event. Because the occurrence of a stressful life event cannot be foreseen, characterizing the temporal trajectory of its neural manifestations in humans has been a real challenge. The current prospective study examined the emotional experience and brain responses of 50 a priori healthy new recruits to the Israeli Defense Forces at 2 time points: before they entered their mandatory military service and after their subsequent exposure to stressful events while deployed in combat units. Over time, soldiers reported on increase in stress symptoms that was correlated with greater amygdala and hippocampus responsiveness to stress-related content. However, these closely situated core limbic regions exhibited different temporal trajectories with regard to the stress effect; whereas amygdala's reactivity before stress predicted the increase in stress symptoms, the hippocampal change in activation over time correlated with the increase in such symptoms. Hippocampal plasticity was also reflected by a modification over time of its functional coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and this coupling magnitude was again predicted by predated amygdala reactivity. Together, these findings suggest that variations in human's likelihood to develop symptomatic phenomena following stressful life events may depend on a balanced interplay between their amygdala's predisposing reactivity and hippocampal posteriori intra- and interregional plasticity. Accordingly, an individually tailored therapeutic approach for trauma survivors should target these 2 neural probes while considering their unique temporal prints.},

abstract = {Organotin compounds have a broad range of applications. While dialkyltin compounds are used primarily as stabilizers for plastics, tri substituted organotins are mainly used as biocides e.g., as an active ingredient of marine antifouling paints for boats and ships. Since a number of organotin compounds have been demonstrated to be toxic, there is increasing concern that their widespread use may cause adverse effects within environmental and biological systems. Besides carcinogenic and neurotoxic effects, as well as effects on the reproductive system, the most obvious mammalian effects of both various di- and trisubstituted organotins were found on the immune system. Exposure of humans to organotin compounds can take place through consumption of contaminated fish and seafood. In human liver samples, mainly dibutyltin, the metabolite of tributyltin, could be detected indicating that organotin compounds are bioavailable after dietary exposure. The objective of this short review is to present various toxicokinetic aspects of organotin compounds in more detail. While several studies using in vitro systems investigated their metabolism especially by the monooxygenase system, various aspects of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) pathways of different organotin compounds were described by data obtained from several studies with laboratory animals. However, most of these studies were not conducted as full ADME studies but dealt only with some of these aspects. Therefore, for definitive conclusions in some cases, additional information is requested. By reviewing and updating the current literature consideration was given preferentially to those organotin compounds which have relevance with respect to human exposure and/or toxicological effects.},

abstract = {The ozone molecule contains three atoms of oxygen and is mainly formed by the action of the ultraviolet rays of the sun on the diatomic oxygen molecules in the upper part of the Earth's atmosphere (called the stratosphere). Atmospheric pollution near the Earth's surface can form localized areas of ozone. The stratospheric ozone layer protects life on Earth by absorbing most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. In the mid 1970s it was discovered that some manmade products destroy ozone molecules in the stratosphere. This destruction can result in damage to ecosystems and to materials such as plastics. It may cause an increase in human diseases such as skin cancers and cataracts. The discovery of the role of the synthetic ozone-depleting chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) stimulated increased research and monitoring in this field. Computer models predicted a disaster if no action was taken to protect the ozone layer. Based on this research and monitoring, the nations of the world took action in 1985 with the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer followed by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. The Convention and Protocol were amended and adjusted several times as new knowledge was obtained. The Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol appointed three Assessment Panels to review the progress in scientific knowledge on their behalf. These panels are the Scientific Assessment Panel, the Technological and Economic Assessment Panel and the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel. Each panel covers a designated area and there is a natural level of overlap. The main reports of the Panels are published every four years as required by the Meeting of the Parties. All the reports have an executive summary that is distributed more widely than the main report itself. It became customary to add a set of questions and answers—mainly for non-expert readers—to the executive summaries. This document contains the questions and answers prepared by experts who comprise the Environmental Assessment Panel. It is based mainly on the 2006 report of the Panel but also contains information from previous assessments. Readers who need detailed information on any question should consult the full reports for a more complete scientific discussion. This set of questions refers mainly to the environmental effects of ozone depletion and climate change. The report of the Scientific Assessment Panel contains questions and answers related to the other scientific issues addressed by that Panel. All these reports can be found on the UNEP website (http://ozone.unep.org). {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria probably exhibit the widest range of diversity in growth habitats of all photosynthetic organisms. They are found in cold and hot, alkaline and acidic, marine, freshwater, saline, terrestrial, and symbiotic environments. In addition to this, they originated on earth at least 2.5 billion years ago and have evolved through periods of dramatic O2 increases, CO2 declines, and temperature changes. One of the key problems they have faced through evolution and in their current environments is the capture of CO2 and its efficient use by Rubisco in photosynthesis. A central response to this challenge has been the development of a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) that can be adapted to various environmental limitations. There are two primary functional elements of this CCM. Firstly, the containment of Rubisco in carboxysome protein microbodies within the cell (the sites of CO2 elevation), and, secondly, the presence of several inorganic carbon (Ci) transporters that deliver HCO3- intracellularly. Cyanobacteria show both species adaptation and acclimation of this mechanism. Between species, there are differences in the suites of Ci transporters in each genome, the nature of the carboxysome structures and the functional roles of carbonic anhydrases. Within a species, different CCM activities can be induced depending on the Ci availability in the environment. This acclimation is largely based on the induction of multiple Ci transporters with different affinities and specificities for either CO2 or HCO3- as substrates. These features are discussed in relation to our current knowledge of the genomic sequences of a diverse array of cyanobacteria and their ecological environments.},

abstract = {Aims: Assessment of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-degrading bacteria isolated from plastic waste dumpsites of Gulf of Mannar. Methods and Results: Rationally, 15 bacteria (GMB1-GMB15) were isolated by enrichment technique. GMB5 and GMB7 were selected for further studies based on their efficiency to degrade the HDPE and identified as Arthrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Assessed weight loss of HDPE after 30 days of incubation was nearly 12% for Arthrobacter sp. and 15% for Pseudomonas sp. The bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay showed that the cell surface hydrophobicity of Pseudomonas sp. was higher than Arthrobacter sp. Both fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and protein content of the biofilm were used to test the viability and protein density of the biomass. Acute peak elevation was observed between 2 and 5 days of inoculation for both bacteria. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum showed that keto carbonyl bond index (KCBI), Ester carbonyl bond index (ECBI) and Vinyl bond index (VBI) were increased indicating changes in functional group(s) and/or side chain modification confirming the biodegradation. Conclusion: The results pose us to suggest that both Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter sp. were proven efficient to degrade HDPE, albeit the former was more efficacious, yet the ability of latter cannot be neglected. Significance and Impact of the Study: Recent alarm on ecological threats to marine system is dumping plastic waste in the marine ecosystem and coastal arena by anthropogenic activity. In maintenance phase of the plastic-derived polyethylene waste, the microbial degradation plays a major role; the information accomplished in this work will be the initiating point for the degradation of polyethylene by indigenous bacterial population in the marine ecosystem and provides a novel eco-friendly solution in eco-management. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract = {The contributions of Peter Hochachka to the development of comparative and adaptational biochemistry are substantial. In particular, he and his academic offspring made major contributions to the understanding of the metabolism of molluscs and fishes. These two large taxonomic groups each have marine, freshwater and terrestrial/semiterrestrial representatives, and their mitochondrial metabolism has been shaped by these environmental conditions. In particular, the importance of amino acids and lipids as energy sources has interesting correlations with the environment and the osmotic strategy used. In marine molluscs, amino acids are important aerobic energy sources, and are used as osmolytes and participate in anaerobic metabolism. In marine elasmobranchs, amino acids and ketone bodies, but not lipids per se, are important energy sources in extrahepatic tissues. Marine and freshwater teleost fish by contrast use lipids as an extrahepatic energy source with minimal use of ketone bodies. Furthermore, ketone bodies are important in the metabolism of freshwater and terrestrial but not marine molluscs. The bases for these different metabolic plans may lie in the solute systems used by the different groups (e.g. amino acids in marine molluscs and urea in marine elasmobranchs). The various metabolic options used by fishes and molluscs indicate the plasticity of metabolic design in an environmental context. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Biodegradation of HPAM may be an efficient way to solve these problems. The biodegradability of HPAM in an aerobic environment was studied. Two HPAM-degrading bacterial strains, named PM-2 and PM-3, were isolated from the produced water of polymer flooding. They were subsequently identified as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus sp., respectively. The utilization of HPAM by the two strains was explored. The amide group of HPAM could serve as a nitrogen source for the two microorganisms, the carbon backbone of these polymers could be partly utilized by microorganisms. The HPAM samples before and after bacterial biodegradation were analyzed by the infrared spectrum, high performance liquid chromatography and scanning electronic microscope. The results indicated that the amide group of HPAM in the biodegradation products had been converted to a carboxyl group, and no acrylamide monomer was found. The HPAM carbon backbone was metabolized by the bacteria during the course of its growth. Further more, the hypothesis about the biodegradation of HPAM in aerobic bacterial culture is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We analysed the frequency of ingested plastic in chick meals delivered by adults in four species of auklet - Crested (Aethia cristatella), Least (A. pusilla), Parakeet (A. psittacula), and Whiskered (A. pygmaea) - from three breeding colonies in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, USA over a 14-year period from 1993 to 2006. Among 2541 chick meals, we found plastic in only one - from a Whiskered Auklet on Buldir Island in 1993. While adult Parakeet Auklets have a high frequency of plastic ingestion (over 90%), no chick meals contained plastic. Unlike other seabirds, the planktivorous auklets do not appear to offload plastic to their chicks, and we conclude that auklet chicks are probably at a low risk of contamination from plastic debris. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Relatively little is known about biofilter autochthonous population structure and function. The present study was aimed at isolating and characterizing an autochthonous denitrifying bacterium from a marine biofilter installed at a recirculation aquaculture system. Colonization of four different media in a marine fish farm was followed by isolation of various denitrifying strains and molecular classification of the most promising one, strain T2, as a novel member of the Pseudomonas fluorescens cluster. This strain exhibits high metabolic versatility regarding N and C source utilization and environmental conditions for growth. It removed nitrate through aerobic assimilatory metabolism at a specific rate of 116.2 mg NO 3-N g dw-1 h-1. Dissimilatory NO3-N removal was observed under oxic conditions at a limited rate, where transient NO2-N formed represented 22% (0.17 mg L-1) of the maximum transient NO2-N observed under anoxic conditions. Dissimilatory NO3-N removal under anoxic conditions occurred at a specific rate of 53.5 mg NO3-N g dw-1 h-1. The isolated denitrifying strain was able to colonize different materials, such as granular activated carbon (GAC), Filtralite and Bioflow plastic rings, which allow the development of a prototype bioreactor for strain characterization under dynamic conditions and mimicking fish-farm operating conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Distinctive characteristics of modern humans, including language, tool manufacture and use, culture, and behavioral plasticity, are linked to changes in the organization and size of the brain during hominin evolution. As brain tissue is metabolically and nutritionally costly to develop and maintain, early hominin encephalization has been linked to a release of energetic and nutritional constraints. One such nutrient-based approach has focused on the n-3 long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is a primary constituent of membrane phospholipids within the synaptic networks of the brain essential for optimal cognitive functioning. As biosynthesis of DHA from n-3 dietary precursors (alpha-linolenic acid, LNA) is relatively inefficient, it has been suggested that preformed DHA must have been an integral dietary constituent during evolution of the genus Homo to facilitate the growth and development of an encephalizing brain. Furthermore, preformed DHA has only been identified to an appreciable extent within aquatic resources (marine and freshwater), leading to speculation that hominin encephalization is linked specifically to access and consumption of aquatic resources. The key premise of this perspective is that biosynthesis of DHA from LNA is not only inefficient but also insufficient for the growth and maturation demands of an encephalized brain. However, this assumption is not well-supported, and much evidence instead suggests that consumption of LNA, available in a wider variety of sources within a number of terrestrial ecosystems, is sufficient for normal brain development and maintenance in modern humans and presumably our ancestors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A previous report describes immunostaining for CaMKII$\alpha$ in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. In this study, CaMKII$\alpha$ is colocalized in the rat with three putative markers of nociceptive DRG neurons, isolectin Griffonia simplicifolia (I-B4), identifying small-diameter, "peptide-poor" neurons; calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), identifying "peptide-rich" neurons; or the vanilloid receptor 1 (VR1), identifying neurons activated by heat, acid, and capsaicin. Lumbar 4 and 5 DRG sections were labeled using immunofluorescence or lectin binding histochemistry, and percentages of single and double-labeled CaMKII$\alpha$ neurons were determined. Stereological estimates of total neuron number in the L4 DRG were 13,815 ± 2,798 and in the L5 DRG were 14,111 ± 4,043. Percentages of single-labeled L4 DRG neurons were 41% ± 2% CaMKII$\alpha$ 38% ± 3% I-B4, 44% ± 3% CGRP, and 32% ± 6% VR1. Percentages of single-labeled L5 DRG neurons were 44% ± 5% CaMKII$\alpha$, 48% ± 2% I-B4, 41% ± 7% CGRP, and 39% ± 14% VR1. For L4 and L5, respectively, estimates of double-labeled CaMKII$\alpha$ neurons showed 34% ± 2% and 38% ± 17% labeled for I-B4, 25% ± 14% and 19% ± 10% labeled for CGRP, and 37% ± 7% and 38% ± 5% labeled for VR1. Conversely, for L4 and L5, respectively, 39% ± 14% and 38% ± 7% I-B4 binding neurons, 24% ± 12% and 23% ± 10% CGRP neurons, and 42% ± 7% and 35% ± 7% VR1 neurons labeled for CaMKII$\alpha$. The mean diameter of CaMKII$\alpha$-labeled neurons was approximately 27 $\mu$m, confirming that this enzyme was preferentially localized in small DRG neurons. The results indicate that subpopulations of DRG neurons containing CaMKII$\alpha$ are likely to be involved in the processing of nociceptive information. Thus, this enzyme may play a critical role in the modulation of nociceptor activity and plasticity of primary sensory neurons. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Little work on this enzyme has been carried out in invertebrates, and results have suggested enzymatic or gene differences with the vertebrate isozyme. To date, a CYP4 isozyme has been characterized and sequenced in the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, but no CYP1A invertebrate sequence has been found. The aim of this study was to identify CYP1A and CYP4 transcripts in the freshwater bivalve, Unio tumidus, and to compare their expression with those of the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, after treatment with the specific CYP1A1 and CYP4 vertebrate inducers, Aroclor 1254 and diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), respectively. In spite of numerous amplification conditions and primer combinations tested, which had been successful in fish, no CYP1A sequence was amplified on cDNA of the digestive gland from either control and Aroclor-treated mussels. On the other hand, CYP4 transcripts were amplified in digestive glands from control and DEHP-treated mussels. As opposed to fish, no induction of this isozyme was obtained in mussels after phthalate treatment. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The removal of the eyestalk (s) induces molting and reproduction promoted the presence of regulatory substances in the eyestalk (ES), particularly medulla terminalis X-organ and the sinus gland (MTXO-SG). The PCR-based cloning strategies have allowed for isolating a great number of cDNAs sequences of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) neuropeptides family from the eyestalk and non-eyestalk tissues, e.g., pericardial organs and fore- and hindguts. However, the translated corresponding neuropeptides in these tissues, their circulating concentrations, the mode of actions, and specific physiological functions have not been well described. The profiles of CHH neuropeptides present in the MTXO-SG may differ among decapod crustacean species, but they can be largely divided into two sub-groups on the basis of structural homology: (1) CHH and (2) molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH)/mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone (MOIH)/vitellogenesis/gonad-inhibiting hormone (V/GIH). CHH typically elevating the level of circulating glucose from animals under stressful conditions (hyper- and hypothermia, hypoxia, and low salinity) has multiple target tissues and functions such as ecdysteroidogenesis, osmoregulation, and vitellogenesis. Recently, MIH, known for exclusively suppressing ecdysteroidogenesis in Y-organs, is also reported to have an additional role in vitellogenesis of adult female crustacean species, suggesting that some CHH neuropeptides may acquire an extra regulatory role in reproduction at adult stage. This paper reviews the regulatory roles of CHH and MIH at the levels of specific functions, temporal and spatial expression, titers, their binding sites on the target tissues, and second messengers from two crab species: the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the European green crab, Carcinus maenas. It further discusses the diverse regulatory roles of these neuropeptides and the functional plasticity of these neuropeptides in regard to life stage and species-specific physiology. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Seroma formation is common following mastectomy and autologous breast reconstruction and is a potential cause of significant morbidity in patients. For this reason, many methods have been investigated to prevent this complication. BD Cell-Tak is a tissue adhesive formulated from the proteins excreted by the marine mussel Mytilus edulis. The purpose of this study was to determine if Cell-Tak is able to prevent seroma formation in a rat mastectomy seroma model. Twenty Sprague-Dawley rats underwent unilateral radical mastectomy, partial axillary lymph node dissection, and disruption of the dermal lymphatics. The animals were randomly assigned to either control (n = 10) or experimental groups (n = 10). The experimental animals received 0.3 ml of the topical adhesive in the wound prior to closure, whereas control animals received no treatment. On postoperative day 7, seroma collections were aspirated and quantified and the tissue flaps were sent for histologic analysis. The control rats had a mean seroma volume of 5.3 ± 2.6 ml, whereas the rats treated with Cell-Tak tissue adhesive had a mean seroma volume of 1.8 ± 1.5 ml (p < 0.004). Histologic analysis revealed mild inflammation consistent with postoperative changes in both groups and no evidence of foreign body reaction to the adhesive. BD Cell-Tak tissue adhesive significantly reduces seroma formation in the rat mastectomy model. This tissue adhesive may prove beneficial in patients undergoing mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction. {\textcopyright}2006, Copyright the Authors.},

abstract = {Background: The Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica, is an infaunal stenothermal bivalve mollusc with a circumpolar distribution. It plays a significant role in bentho-pelagic coupling and hence has been proposed as a sentinel species for climate change monitoring. Previous studies have shown that this mollusc displays a high level of plasticity with regard to shell deposition and damage repair against a background of genetic homogeneity. The Southern Ocean has amongst the lowest present-day CaCO3saturation rate of any ocean region, and is predicted to be among the first to become undersaturated under current ocean acidification scenarios. Hence, this species presents as an ideal candidate for studies into the processes of calcium regulation and shell deposition in our changing ocean environments.Results: 454 sequencing of L. elliptica mantle tissue generated 18,290 contigs with an average size of 535 bp (ranging between 142 bp-5.591 kb). BLAST sequence similarity searching assigned putative function to 17% of the data set, with a significant proportion of these transcripts being involved in binding and potentially of a secretory nature, as defined by GO molecular function and biological process classifications. These results indicated that the mantle is a transcriptionally active tissue which is actively proliferating. All transcripts were screened against an in-house database of genes shown to be involved in extracellular matrix formation and calcium homeostasis in metazoans. Putative identifications were made for a number of classical shell deposition genes, such as tyrosinase, carbonic anhydrase and metalloprotease 1, along with novel members of the family 2 G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). A membrane transport protein (SEC61) was also characterised and this demonstrated the utility of the clam sequence data as a resource for examining cold adapted amino acid substitutions. The sequence data contained 46,235 microsatellites and 13,084 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs/INDELS), providing a resource for population and also gene function studies.Conclusions: This is the first 454 data from an Antarctic marine invertebrate. Sequencing of mantle tissue from this non-model species has considerably increased resources for the investigation of the processes of shell deposition and repair in molluscs in a changing environment. A number of promising candidate genes were identified for functional analyses, which will be the subject of further investigation in this species and also used in model-hopping experiments in more tractable and economically important model aquaculture species, such as Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus edulis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Clark et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Genetic data argues that Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be initiated by aggregates of a 42 amino acid beta amyloid peptide (A$\beta$42). The A$\beta$ aggregates, notably small oligomer species, cause a cascade of events including oxidative damage, inflammation, synaptic toxicity and accumulation of intraneuronal inclusions; notably neurofibrillary tangles. Cognitive deficits are likely to begin with a failure of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity with dendritic spine loss and dying back of dendritic arbor. This is followed by neuron loss in key areas involved in learning and memory. Significant prevention or delay of clinical onset may be achievable by modifying environmental risk factors that impact the underlying pathogenic pathways. Because low fish intake and low blood levels of the marine lipid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been associated with increased AD risk we have tested the impact of depleting or supplementing with dietary DHA on AD pathogenesis in transgenic mice bearing a mutant human gene known to cause AD in people. We reported that even with intervention late in life dietary DHA depletion dramatically enhanced oxidative damage and the loss of dendritic markers, while DHA supplementation markedly reduced A$\beta$42 accumulation and oxidative damage, corrected many synaptic deficits and improved cognitive function. Loss of brain DHA was exacerbated in mice expressing the mutant human AD transgene, this is consistent with evidence for increased oxidative attack on DHA oxidation in AD. Treatment with the curry spice extract curcumin, a polyphenolic antioxidant that inhibits AP aggregation, has been strongly protective in the same mouse model. Many Western diets are typically deficient in DHA and low in polyphenolic antioxidant intake. These and other data argue that increasing dietary intake of both DHA and polyphenolic antioxidants may be useful for AD prevention. {\textcopyright} 2006 A B Academic Publishers.

abstract = {Sperm competition has classically been thought to maintain anisogamy (large eggs and smaller sperm) because males are thought to maximize their chance of winning fertilizations by trading sperm size for number. More recently it has been recognized that sperm quality (e.g., size, velocity) can also influence sperm competition, although studies have yielded conflicting results. Because sex evolved in the sea, debate has continued over the role of sperm competition and sperm environment in determining both sperm and egg size in externally fertilizing broadcast spawners. Remarkably, however, there have been no direct tests of whether broadcast spawners change the traits of their gametes depending on the likelihood of sperm competition. We manipulated the density (and thus, sperm environment) of a broadcast spawning ascidian (Styela plicata) in the field and then determined whether the phenotype of eggs and sperm changed. We found that sperm from adults kept at high density were larger and more motile than sperm from low-density adults. In vitro fertilizations revealed that sperm from high-density adults also lived longer and induced less polyspermy. Adult density also affected egg traits: eggs from high-density adults were smaller targets for sperm overall but produced larger ovicells than eggs from low-density adults. This suggests that broadcast spawning mothers balance (potentially conflicting) pre- and postzygotic selection pressures on egg size. Overall, our results suggest that sperm competition does not represent a strong force maintaining anisogamy in broadcast spawners. Instead, sperm limitation seems to select for large eggs and smaller, more numerous sperm. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that attachment of the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata to the cellulose-containing surface of the green alga Ulva australis is mediated by a mannose-sensitive haemagglutinin (MSHA-like) pilus. We have identified an MSHA pilus biogenesis gene locus in P. tunicata, termed msh/1/2JKLMNEGFBACDOPO, which shows significant homology, with respect to its genetic characteristics and organization, to the MSHA pilus biogenesis gene locus of Vibrio cholerae. Electron microscopy studies revealed that P. tunicata wild-type cells express flexible pili peritrichously arranged on the cell surface. A P. tunicata mutant (SM5) with a transposon insertion in the mshJ region displayed a non-piliated phenotype. Using SM5, it has been demonstrated that the MSHA pilus promotes attachment of P. tunicata wild-type cells in polystyrene microtitre plates, as well as to microcrystalline cellulose and to the living surface of U. australis. P. tunicata also demonstrated increased pilus production in response to cellulose and its monomer constituent cellobiose. The MSHA pilus thus functions as a determinant of attachment in P. tunicata, and it is proposed that an understanding of surface sensing mechanisms displayed by P. tunicata will provide insight into specific ecological interactions that occur between this bacterium and higher marine organisms. {\textcopyright} 2006 SGM.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the distribution, abundance and characteristics of plastic particles in plankton samples collected routinely in Northeast Pacific ecosystems, and to contribute to the development of ideas for future research into the occurrence and impact of small plastic debris in marine pelagic ecosystems. Plastic debris particles were assessed from zooplankton samples collected as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) ongoing ecosystem surveys during two research cruises in the Southeast Bering Sea in the spring and fall of 2006 and four research cruises off the U.S. west coast (primarily off southern California) in spring, summer and fall of 2006, and in January of 2007. Nets with 0.505 mm mesh were used to collect surface samples during all cruises, and sub-surface samples during the four cruises off the west coast. The 595 plankton samples processed indicate that plastic particles are widely distributed in surface waters. The proportion of surface samples from each cruise that contained particles of plastic ranged from 8.75 to 84.0%, whereas particles were recorded in sub-surface samples from only one cruise (in 28.2% of the January 2007 samples). Spatial and temporal variability was apparent in the abundance and distribution of the plastic particles and mean standardized quantities varied among cruises with ranges of 0.004-0.19 particles/m3, and 0.014-0.209 mg dry mass/m3. Off southern California, quantities for the winter cruise were significantly higher, and for the spring cruise significantly lower than for the summer and fall surveys (surface data). Differences between surface particle concentrations and mass for the Bering Sea and California coast surveys were significant for pair-wise comparisons of the spring but not the fall cruises. The particles were assigned to three plastic product types: product fragments, fishing net and line fibers, and industrial pellets; and five size categories: <1 mm, 1-2.5 mm, >2.5-5 mm, >5-10 mm, and >10 mm. Product fragments accounted for the majority of the particles, and most were less than 2.5 mm in size. The ubiquity of such particles in the survey areas and predominance of sizes <2.5 mm implies persistence in these pelagic ecosystems as a result of continuous breakdown from larger plastic debris fragments, and widespread distribution by ocean currents. Detailed investigations of the trophic ecology of individual zooplankton species, and their encounter rates with various size ranges of plastic particles in the marine pelagic environment, are required in order to understand the potential for ingestion of such debris particles by these organisms. Ongoing plankton sampling programs by marine research institutes in large marine ecosystems are good potential sources of data for continued assessment of the abundance, distribution and potential impact of small plastic debris in productive coastal pelagic zones. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {No organism can survive across the entire temperature range found in the biosphere, and a given species can rarely support active metabolism across more than a few tens of °C. Nevertheless, life can be maintained at surprisingly extreme temperatures, from below -50 to over 110°C. That proteins, which are assembled with the same 20 amino acids in all species, can function well at both extremes of this range illustrates the plasticity available in the construction of these macromolecules. In studying proteins from extremophiles, researchers have found no new amino acids, covalent modifications or structural motifs that explain the ability of these molecules to function in such harsh environments. Rather, subtle redistributions of the same intramolecular interactions required for protein stabilization at moderate temperatures are sufficient to maintain structural integrity at hot or cold extremes. The key to protein function, whether in polar seas or hot springs, is the maintenance of an appropriate balance between molecular stability on the one hand and structural flexibility on the other. Stability is needed to ensure the appropriate geometry for ligand binding, as well as to avoid denaturation, while flexibility is necessary to allow catalysis at a metabolically appropriate rate. Comparisons of homologous proteins from organisms spanning a wide range of thermal habitats show that adaptive mutations, as well as stabilizing solutes, maintain a balance between these two attributes, regardless of the temperature at which the protein functions. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

The species' life histories depend on saline water to differing degrees, their habitats ranging from the marine/intertidal (P. northropi), through estuaries (P. pandaliformis) to coastal, freshwater streams (M. olfersii, M. potiuna) and inland, continental river systems (M. brasiliense). Hemolymph osmolality, chloride, sodium and magnesium concentrations were measured in shrimps exposed to experimental media ranging from fresh water (<0.5‰) to concentrated seawater (42‰) for up to 10 days. The marine and estuarine Palaemon species exhibit well-developed hyper/hypo-osmotic, sodium and chloride regulatory capabilities in mid-range salinities, tending to hyperconform in low salinities. The freshwater Macrobrachium species show variable hyperosmotic, sodium and chloride regulatory capacities, tending to hypoconform or unable to survive at higher salinities. All species hyper-regulate magnesium in fresh water, but hyporegulate strongly in saline media. Palaemonids from the saline habitats show the strongest osmoregulatory capabilities, and fresh water may have been gradually invaded by ancestral species with similar regulatory capacity. However, this regulatory plasticity has been lost to varying degrees in extant freshwater species. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Polyethylene sampler uptake was compared to polychaete uptake to assess bioavailability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from resuspended sediments. New Bedford Harbor (MA, U.S.) sediment, contaminated with PCBs, was resuspended under four different water column oxidation conditions: resuspension alone, resuspension under aeration, resuspension under helium, and no resuspension (control). Residuals were tested for differences in PCB availability to the marine polychaete Nereis virens and to polyethylene (PE) passive samplers. Few significant differences between the four resuspension treatments were observed: under aeration, three of 23 PCBs analyzed showed significant increases in polychaete accumulation, while resuspension alone showed increased concentrations in PE samplers for nine of 23 PCBs. Otherwise, no differences were observed and overall we concluded that resuspension had no effect on residual PCB availability. The relationship between disequilibrium-corrected PE and lipid-normalized polychaete PCB concentrations was nearly 1:1 with a strong linear correlation (r 2 ) 0.877), demonstrating PCBs are taken up similarly into PE and lipid. On average, PE samplers suggested dissolved PCB concentrations 3.6 times greater than those calculated with lipid-water partitioning, though on a congener-specific basis this was only observed for lower chlorinated PCBs; for higher chlorinated PCBs, PE-water partitioning suggested lower dissolved concentrations than those based on lipid. Organic carbon (OC)-water and OC and black carbon combined (OC+BC)-water partitioning suggested average dissolved concentrations 29 and 10 times greater, respectively, than those estimated with lipid-water partitioning. This demonstrates that PE-measured porewater concentrations can provide a more reliable estimate of bioavailability than sediment geochemistry. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Apostichopus japonicus is a common sea cucumber that undergoes seasonal inactivity phases and ceases feeding during the summer months. We used this sea cucumber species as a model in which to examine phenotypic plasticity of the digestive tract in response to food deprivation. We measured the body mass, gross gut morphology and digestive enzyme activities of A. japonicus before, during, and after the period of inactivity to examine the effects of food deprivation on the gut structure and function of this animal. Individuals were sampled semi-monthly from June to November (10 sampling intervals over 178 days) across temperature changes of more than 18 °C. On 5 September, which represented the peak of inactivity and lack of feeding, A. japonicus decreased its body mass, gut mass and gut length by 50%, 85%, and 70%, respectively, in comparison to values for these parameters preceding the inactive period. The activities of amylase, cellulase and lipase decreased by 77%, 98%, and 35% respectively, in comparison to mean values for these enzymes in June, whereas pepsin activity increased two-fold during the inactive phase. Alginase and trypsin activities were variable and did not change significantly across the 178-day experiment. With the exception of amylase and cellulase, all body size indices and digestive enzyme activities recovered and even surpassed the mean values preceding the inactive phase during the latter part of the experiment (October-November). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) utilizing the digestive enzyme activity and body size index data divided the physiological state of this cucumber into four phases: an active stage, prophase of inactivity, peak inactivity, and a reversion phase. These phases are all consistent with previously suggested life stages for this species, but our data provide more defined characteristics of each phase. A. japonicus clearly exhibits phenotypic plasticity (or life-cycle staging) of the digestive tract during its annual inactive period. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Bipolar spindle assembly is critical for achieving accurate segregation of chromosomes. In the absence of centrosomes, meiotic spindles achieve bipolarity by a combination of chromosome-initiated microtubule nucleation and stabilization and motor-driven organization of microtubules. Once assembled, the spindle structure is maintained on a relatively long time scale despite the high turnover of the microtubules that comprise it. To study the underlying mechanisms responsible for spindle assembly and steady-state maintenance, we used microneedle manipulation of preassembled spindles in Xenopus egg extracts. Results: When two meiotic spindles were brought close enough together, they interacted, creating an interconnected microtubule structure with supernumerary poles. Without exception, the perturbed system eventually re-established bipolarity, forming a single spindle of normal shape and size. Bipolar spindle fusion was blocked when cytoplasmic dynein function was perturbed, suggesting a critical role for the motor in this process. The fusion of Eg5-inhibited monopoles also required dynein function but only occurred if the initial interpolar separation was less than twice the microtubule radius of a typical monopole. Conclusions: Our experiments uniquely illustrate the architectural plasticity of the spindle and reveal a robust ability of the system to attain a bipolar morphology. We hypothesize that a major mechanism driving spindle fusion is dynein-mediated sliding of oppositely oriented microtubules, a novel function for the motor, and posit that this same mechanism might also be involved in normal spindle assembly and homeostasis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A range of extrinsic signals, including afferent activity, affect neuronal growth and plasticity. Neuronal activity regulates intracellular Ca 2+, and activity-dependent calcium signaling has been shown to regulate dendritic growth and branching (Konur and Ghosh, 2005). NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stimulation of Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signaling cascades has, moreover, been demonstrated to regulate neurite/axonal outgrowth (Wayman et al., 2004). We used a sodium channel activator, brevetoxin (PbTx-2), to explore the relationship between intracellular [Na +] and NMDAR-dependent development. PbTx-2 alone, at a concentration of 30 nM, did not affect Ca 2+ dynamics in 2 d in vitro cerebrocortical neurons; however, this treatment robustly potentiated NMDA-induced Ca 2+ influx. The 30 nM PbTx-2 treatment produced a maximum [Na +] i of 16.9 ±1.5 mM, representing an increment of 8.8 ± 1.8 mM over basal. The corresponding membrane potential change produced by 30 nM PbTx-2 was modest and, therefore, insufficient to relieve the voltage-dependent Mg 2+ block of NMDARs. To unambiguously demonstrate the enhancement of NMDA receptor function by PbTx-2, we recorded single-channel currents from cell-attached patches. PbTx-2 treatment was found to increase both the mean open time and open probability of NMDA receptors. These effects of PbTx-2 on NMDA receptor function were dependent on extracellular Na + and activation of Src kinase. The functional consequences of PbTx-2-induced enhancement of NMDAR function were evaluated in immature cerebrocortical neurons. PbTx-2 concentrations between 3 and 300 nM enhanced neurite outgrowth. Voltage-gated sodium channel activators may accordingly represent a novel pharmacologic strategy to regulate neuronal plasticity through an NMDA receptor and Src family kinase-dependent mechanism.

abstract = {Diethyl phthalate (DEP) is used as a plasticizer, a detergent base, in aerosol sprays, as a perfume binder in incense sticks and after-shave lotions. It is known to be a contaminant of freshwater and marine ecosystems. Therefore, a study was designed to determine the toxic effects of DEP on a freshwater fish, Cirrhina mrigala. The fish was treated with 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm (w/v) DEP dissolved in acetone to determine the LC50. Positive controls were treated with acetone only. There was 100% mortality observed within 24 h in 75 and 100 ppm, and 50% mortality in 50 ppm treated fish in 72 h. Those treated at 25 ppm showed only 10% mortality within 72 h and remaining fish continued to survive. The surviving fish were treated with 25 ppm DEP once daily for 3 days with every change of water (Group III). One group was maintained as negative control in dechlorinated water (Group I) and the other group received acetone once daily for 3 days with every change of water and was used as positive control (Group II). Fish were killed by cold narcosis on an ice block and dissected to obtain liver, muscle, and brain samples; 10% homogenates in ice-cold saline were prepared. Brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity was measured. Liver aspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and liver and muscle succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) alkaline and acid phosphate (ALP and ACP) were measured. There was a significant increase in liver and muscle ACP and ALP in DEP-treated fish compared with positive and negative controls. There was a significant increase in muscle SDH and liver ALT (ALT) in DEP-treated fish compared with positive and negative controls. Brain AchE level was significantly decreased in DEP-treated fish compared to positive and negative controls. These results indicate that DEP brings about significant changes in the activity of certain liver and muscle enzymes. These alterations in enzyme activity may have long-term effects on that are continuously exposed to low doses of DEP in the aquatic environment. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {Calpain-catalyzed proteolysis of $\alpha$II-spectrin is a regulated event associated with neuronal long-term potentiation, platelet and leukocyte activation, and other processes. Calpain proteolysis is also linked to apoptotic and nonapoptotic cell death following excessive glutamate exposure, hypoxia, HIV-gp120/160 exposure, or toxic injury. The molecular basis for these divergent consequences of calpain action, and their relationship to spectrin proteolysis, is unclear. Calpain preferentially cleaves $\alpha$II spectrin in vitro in repeat 11 between residues Y1176 and G1177. Unless stimulated by Ca++ and calmodulin (CaM), $\beta$II spectrin proteolysis in vitro is much slower. We identify additional unrecognized sites in spectrin targeted by calpain in vitro and in vivo. Bound CaM induces a second $\alpha$II spectrin cleavage at G1230*S1231. $\beta$II spectrin is cleaved at four sites. One cleavage only occurs in the absence of CaM at high enzyme-to-substrate ratios near the $\beta$II spectrin COOH-terminus. CaM promotes $\beta$II spectrin cleavages at Q1440*S1441, S1447*Q1448, and L1482*A1483. These sites are also cleaved in the absence of CaM in recombinant $\beta$II spectrin fusion peptides, indicating that they are probably shielded in the spectrin heterotetramer and become exposed only after CaM binds $\alpha$II spectrin. Using epitope-specific antibodies prepared to the calpain cleavage sites in both $\alpha$II and $\beta$II spectrin, we find in cultured rat cortical neurons that brief glutamate exposure (a physiologic ligand) rapidly stimulates $\alpha$II spectrin cleavage only at Y1176*G1177, while $\beta$II pectrin remains intact. In cultured SH-SY5Y cells that lack an NMDA receptor, glutamate is without effect. Conversely, when stimulated by calcium influx (via maitotoxin), there is rapid and sequential cleavage of $\alpha$II and then $\beta$II spectrin, coinciding with the onset of nonapoptotic cell death. These results identify (i) novel calpain target sites in both $\alpha$IIl and $\beta$II spectrin; (ii) trans-regulation of proteolytic susceptibility between the spectrin subunits in vivo; and (iii) the preferential cleavage of all spectrin vs $\beta$II spectrin when responsive cells are stimulated by engagement of the NMDA receptor. We postulate that calpain proteolysis of spectrin can activate two physiologically distinct responses: one that enhances skeletal plasticity without destroying the spectrin-actin skeleton, characterized by preservation of $\beta$II spectrin; or an alternative response closely correlated with nonapoptotic cell death and characterized by proteolysis of $\beta$II spectrin and complete dissolution of the spectrin skeleton. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

In particular, I present evidence that postsynaptic mechanisms play a far more important role in nonassociative learning in Aplysia than has been appreciated before now. Moreover, I describe recent data that suggests the intriguing hypothesis that the persistent, learning-induced changes in Aplysia sensory neurons might depend critically on postsynaptic signals for their induction.

abstract = {The marine snail Aplysia has served for more than four decades as an important model system for neurobiological analyses of learning and memory. Until recently, it has been believed that learning and memory in Aplysia were due predominately, if not exclusively, to presynaptic mechanisms. For example, two nonassociative forms of learning exhibited by Aplysia, sensitization and dishabituation of its defensive withdrawal reflex, have been previously ascribed to presynaptic facilitation of the connections between sensory and motor neurons that mediate the reflex. Recent evidence, however, indicates that postsynaptic mechanisms play a far more important role in learning and memory in Aplysia than formerly appreciated. In particular, dishabituation and sensitization depend on a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the postsynaptic motor neuron, postsynaptic exocytosis, and modulation of the functional expression of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors. In addition, the expression of the persistent presynaptic changes that occur during intermediate- and long-term dishabituation and sensitization appears to require retrograde signals that are triggered by elevated postsynaptic Ca2+. The model for learning-related synaptic plasticity proposed here for Aplysia is similar to current mammalian models. This similarity suggests that the cellular mechanisms of learning and memory have been highly conserved during evolution. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PolyADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of nuclear proteins, catalyzed by polyADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). In the nucleus, polyADP-ribosylation catalyzed by PARP-1 alters protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and is implicated in chromatin remodeling, DNA transcription, and repair. Previous results linked the activation of PARP-1 with long-term memory formation during learning in the marine mollusk Aplysia (Science 2004, 304:1820-1822). Furthermore, PARP-1 was highly activated in mammalian cerebral neurons treated with neurotrophins and neurotrophic peptides promoting neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine the possibility that PARP-1 activation is required for memory formation during learning in mammals. Mice were tested in two learning paradigms, object recognition and fear conditioning. PolyADP-ribosylation of PARP-1 and histone H1 were detected in their cerebral cortex and hippocampus immediately after their training session. Moreover, in both behavioral paradigms, suppression of PARP activity in the CNS during learning impaired their long-term memory formation, without damaging their short-term memory. These findings implicate PARP-1 activation in molecular processes underlying long-term memory formation during learning. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

In order to evaluate the fatty acid potential as biomarkers in freshwater, their profile was analyzed during vitellogenesis in two fish species, in both waterfall and reservoir environments of the Para{\'{i}}ba do Sul River Basin. Detrivorous Hypostomus affinis and omnivorous Geophagus brasiliensis seem to elongate and desaturate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and transfer them to the ovaries' phospholipids. Waterfall Geophagus brasiliensis have more highly unsaturated fatty acids in the liver, but in the reservoir, accumulation mainly occurs in muscle and ovary triglycerides, suggesting trophic opportunism and a plasticity during vitellogenesis. In Hypostomus affinis, PUFA alteration occurs only in the reservoir, suggesting a high phytoplankton occurrence. Eutrophication and water speed is reflected in Hypostomus affinis ovaries by higher PUFAn3 and bacterial fatty acids. As in marine environments, analysis of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids during vitellogenesis can be used as a tool in food chain studies in freshwater. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The sources of these polluting materials are both land- and marine-based, their origins may be local or distant, and the environmental consequences are many and varied. The more widely recognized problems are typically associated with entanglement, ingestion, suffocation and general debilitation, and are often related to stranding events and public perception. Among the less frequently recognized and recorded problems are global hazards to shipping, fisheries and other maritime activities. Today, there are rapidly developing research interests in the biota attracted to freely floating (i.e. pelagic) marine debris, commonly known as 'hangers-on and hitch-hikers' as well as material sinking to the sea floor despite being buoyant. Dispersal of aggressive alien and invasive species by these mechanisms leads one to reflect on the possibilities that ensuing invasions could endanger sensitive, or at-risk coastal environments (both marine and terrestrial) far from their native habitats. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

However, the molecular identity of NMDA-type receptors in molluscs remains unknown. Here, we cloned two NMDA-type receptors from the sea slug Aplysia californica, AcNR1-1 and AcNR1-2, as well as their homologs from the freshwater pulmonate snail Lymnaea stagnalis, LsNR1-1 and LsNR1-2. The cloned receptors contain a signal peptide, two extracellular segments with predicted binding sites for glycine and glutamate, three recognized transmembrane regions, and a fourth hydrophobic domain that makes a hairpin turn to form a pore-like structure. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that both the AcNR1s and LsNR1s belong to the NR1 subgroup of ionotrophic glutamate receptors. Our in situ hybridization data indicate highly abundant, but predominantly neuron-specific expression of molluscan NR1-type receptors in all central ganglia, including identified motor neurons in the buccal and abdominal ganglia as well as groups of mechanosensory cells. AcNR1 transcripts were detected extrasynaptically in the neurites of metacerebral cells of Aplysia. The widespread distribution of AcNR1 and LsNR1 transcripts also implies diverse functions, including their involvement in the organization of feeding, locomotory, and defensive behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Marine Biological Laboratory.},

abstract = {Organotin compounds are widely used as antifouling agents and bioaccumulate in the food chain. Tributyltin chloride (TBT) has been shown to induce imposex in female gastropods. On the basis of this observation it has been suggested that TBT acts as an endocrine disrupter inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens mediated by the aromatase cytochrome P450 enzyme. However, to date, the molecular basis of TBT-induced imposex and in particular its putative inhibitory effects on human aromatase cytochrome P450 activity have not been investigated. Therefore, we examined the effects of the organotin compounds tetrabutyltin (TTBT), TBT, dibutyltin dichloride (DBT) and monobutyltin trichloride (MBT) on human placental aromatase activity. TBT was found to be a partial competitive inhibitor of aromatase activity with an IC50 value of 6.2 $\mu$M with 0.1 $\mu$M androstenedione as substrate. TBT impaired the affinity of the aromatase to androstenedione but did not affect electron transfer from NADPH to aromatase via inhibiting the NADPH reductase. DBT acted as a partial but less potent inhibitor of human aromatase activity (65% residual activity), whereas TTBT and MBT had no effect. The residual activity of TBT-saturated aromatase was 37%. In contrast, human 3$\beta$-HSD type I activity was only moderately inhibited by TBT (80% residual activity). Moreover, neither TTBT or DBT nor MBT inhibited the 3$\beta$-HSD type I activity. Together, these results suggest that the environmental pollutants TBT and DBT, both present in marine organisms, textile and plastic products, may have specific impacts on the metabolism of sex hormones in humans.

abstract = {Biofouling is a huge problem globally and new alternative antifoulants are presently being investigated. One candidate is medetomidine, a commonly used sedative in veterinary medicine, which has been shown to effectively prevent settlement of barnacles. The purpose of this study was to measure uptake, elimination and bioconcentration of medetomidine in Mytilus edulis, Abra nitida, Crangon crangon and periphyton communities to evaluate the risk of bioaccumulation in the marine environment. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were used to assess the bioaccumulation. The calculations of these factors were based on the distribution of the radiolabelled medetomidine. BCF for C. crangon was 2.8 while M. edulis had a BCF of 134 and the periphyton communities' BCF was 1195 l/kg fresh weight (FW). The concentration of medetomidine in the animals reached steady state after 24-48 h for all test systems except for A. nitida, which never stabilised enough to calculate a bioaccumulation factor (BAF). Elimination from the organism's tissues was rapid for three of the test systems with half-lives between 1 and 24 h. A. nitida had a half-life of 96-120 h. This study demonstrates that the bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of medetomidine differs between aquatic organisms and that microalgal communities in the form of periphyton have the highest bioconcentration factor of the organisms tested. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The cold shock domain (CSD) is an evolutionarily conserved nucleic acid binding domain that exhibits binding activity to RNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA. Mammalian CRHSP-24 contains CSD, but its structure-functional relationship has remained elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of human CRHSP-24 and characterization of the molecular trafficking of CRHSP-24 between stress granules and processing bodies in response to oxidative stress. The structure of CRHSP-24 determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion exhibits an $\alpha$-helix and a compact $\beta$-barrel formed by five curved anti-parallel $\beta$ strands. Ligand binding activity of the CSD is orchestrated by residues Ser41 to Leu43. Interestingly, a phosphomimetic S41D mutant abolishes the ssDNA binding in vitro and causes CRHSP-24 liberated from stress granules in vivo without apparent alternation of its localization to the processing bodies. This new class of phosphorylation-regulated interaction between the CSD and nucleic acids is unique in stress granule plasticity. Importantly, the association of CRHSP-24 with stress granules is blocked by PP4/ PP2A inhibitor calyculin A as PP2A catalyzes the dephosphorylation of Ser 41 of CRHSP-24. Therefore, we speculate that CRHSP-24 participates in oxidative stress response via a dynamic and temporal association between stress granules and processing bodies. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Marine birds can drink seawater because their cephalic 'salt' glands secrete a sodium chloride (NaCl) solution more concentrated than seawater. Salt gland secretion generates osmotically free water that sustains their other physiological processes. Acclimation to saline induces interstitial water and Na move into cells. When the bird drinks seawater, Na enters the plasma from the gut and plasma osmolality (Osmpl) increases. This induces water to move out cells expanding the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV). Both increases in Osmpl and ECFV stimulate salt gland secretion. The augmented intracellular fluid content should allow more rapid expansion of ECFV in response to elevated Osmpl and facilitate activation of salt gland secretion. To fully utilize the potential of the salt glands, intestinally absorbed NaCl must be reabsorbed by the kidneys. Thus, Na uptake at gut and renal levels may constrain extrarenal NaCl secretion. High NaCl intake elevates plasma aldosterone concentration of Pekin ducks and aldosterone stimulates intestinal and renal water and sodium uptake. High NaCl intake induces lengthening of the small intestine of adult Mallards, especially males. High NaCl intake has little effect on glomerular filtration rate or tubular sodium Na uptake of birds with competent salt glands. Relative to body mass, kidney mass and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are greater in birds with salt glands than in birds that do not have them. Birds with salt glands do not change GFR, when they drink saline. Thus, their renal filtrate contains excess Na that is, in some species, almost completely renally reabsorbed and excreted in a more concentrated salt gland secretion. Na reabsorption by kidneys of other species, like mallards is less complete and their salt glands make less concentrated secretion. Such species may reflux urine into the hindgut, where additional Na may also be reabsorbed for extrarenal secretion. During exposure to saline, marine birds maintain elevated aldosterone levels despite high Na intake. Marine birds are excellent examples of physiological plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Progress has been made in understanding peripheral mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain but little is known concerning peripheral mechanisms of cold hypersensitivity. The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution of uninjured primary afferents to the cold hypersensitivity that develops in neuropathic rats. Rats with a lumbar 5 (L5) and L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL, Chung model) but not sham, developed mechanical allodynia, evidenced by decreased paw withdrawal thresholds and increased magnitude of response to von Frey stimulation. Cold hypersensitivity also developed in SNL but not sham rats, evidenced by enhanced nociceptive behaviors induced by placement on a cold plate (6 °C) or application of icilin (a transient receptor potential M8 (TRPM8)/transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) receptor agonist) to nerve-injured hind paws. Single fiber recordings demonstrated that the mean conduction velocities of intact L4 cutaneous A$\delta$- and C-fibers were not different between naive and SNL rats; however, mechanical thresholds of the A$\delta$- but not the C-fibers were significantly decreased in SNL compared with naive. There was a higher prevalence of C-mechanoheat-cold (CMHC) fibers in SNL compared with naive, but the overall percentage of cold-sensitive C-fibers was not significantly increased compared with naive. This was in contrast to the numerous changes in A$\delta$-fibers: the percentage of L4 cold sensitive A$\delta$-, but not C-fibers, was significantly increased, the percentage of L4 icilin-sensitive A$\delta$-, but not C-fibers, was significantly increased, the icilin-induced activity of L4 A$\delta$-, but not C-fibers, was significantly increased. Icilin-induced activity was blocked by the TRPA1 antagonist Ruthenium Red. The results indicate plasticity in both A$\delta$- and C-uninjured fibers, but A$\delta$ fibers appear to provide a major contribution to cold hypersensitivity in neuropathic rats. {\textcopyright} 2007 IBRO.},

abstract = {Embryonic development in teleosts is profoundly affected by environmental conditions, particularly temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The environment determines the rate of myogenesis, the composition of sub-cellular organelles, patterns of gene expression, and the number and size distribution of muscle fibres. During the embryonic and larval stages, muscle plasticity to the environment is usually irreversible due to the rapid pace of ontogenetic change. In the early life stages, muscle can affect locomotory performance and behaviour, with potential consequences for larval survival. Postembryonic growth involves myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) that originate in the embryo. The embryonic temperature regime can have long-term consequences for the growth of skeletal muscle in some species, including the duration and intensity of myotube formation in adult stages. In juvenile and adult fish, abiotic (temperature, day-length, water flow characteristics, hypoxia) and biotic factors (food availability, parasitic infection) have complex effects on the signalling pathways regulating the proliferation and differentiation of MPCs, protein synthesis and degradation, and patterns of gene expression. The phenotypic responses observed to the environment frequently vary during ontogeny and are integrated with endogenous physiological rhythms, particularly sexual maturation. Studies with model teleosts provide opportunities for investigating the underlying genetic mechanisms of muscle plasticity that can subsequently be applied to non-model species of more ecological or commercial interest.},

abstract = {As US military service members return from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with elevated rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention has been increasingly focused on TBI/PTSD comorbidity, its neurobiological mechanisms, and novel and effective treatment approaches. TBI and PTSD, and their comorbid conditions, present with a spectrum of common clinical features such as sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, fatigue, suicidality, chronic pain, and alterations in arousal. These TBI and PTSD disorders are also thought to be characterized by overlapping neural mechanisms. Both conditions are associated with changes in hippocampal, prefrontal cortical, and limbic region function because of alterations in synaptogenesis, dendritic remodeling, and neurogenesis. Neural changes in TBI and PTSD result from pathophysiological disturbances in metabolic, cytotoxic, inflammatory, and apoptic processes, amongst other mechanisms. Neurotrophins have well-established actions in regulating cell growth and survival, differentiation, apoptosis, and cytoskeleton restructuring. A body of research indicates that dysregulation of neural brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is found in conditions of TBI and PTSD. Induction of BDNF and activation of its intracellular receptors can produce neural regeneration, reconnection, and dendritic sprouting, and can improve synaptic efficacy. In this review, we consider treatment approaches that enhance BDNF-related signaling and have the potential to restore neural connectivity. Such treatment approaches could facilitate neuroplastic changes that lead to adaptive neural repair and reverse cognitive and emotional deficits in both TBI and PTSD. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract = {Lobster muscles express a diverse array of myofibrillar protein isoforms. Three fiber types (fast, slow-twitch or S1, and slow-tonic or S2) differ qualitatively and quantitatively in myosin heavy and light chains, troponin-T, -I, and -C, paramyosin, and tropomyosin variants. However, little is known about the diversity of actin isoforms present in crustacean tissues. In this report we characterized cDNAs that encode twelve actin isoforms in the American lobster, Homarus americanus: eight from skeletal muscle (Ha-ActinSK1-8), one from heart (Ha-ActinHT1), and three cytoplasmic type actins from hepatopancreas (Ha-ActinCT1-3). All twelve cDNAs were products of distinct genes, as indicated by differences in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). The open reading frames specified polypeptides 376 or 377 amino acids in length. Although key amino residues are conserved in the lobster actins, variations in nearby sequences may affect actin polymerization and/or interactions with other myofibrillar proteins. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed muscle fiber type- and tissue-specific expression patterns. Ha-Actin-HT1 was expressed exclusively in heart (87% of the total; 12% of the total was Ha-ActinCT1). Ha-ActinCT1 was expressed in all tissues, while CT2 and CT3 were expressed only in hepatopancreas, with Ha-ActinCT2 as the major isoform (93% of the total). Ha-ActinSK1 and SK2 were the major isoforms (88% and 12% of the total, respectively) in the S1 fibers of crusher claw closer muscle. Fast fibers in the cutter claw closer and deep abdominal muscles differed in SK isoforms. Ha-ActinSK3, SK4, and SK5 were the major isoforms in cutter claw closer muscle (12%, 48%, and 37% of the total, respectively). Ha-ActinSK5 and SK8 were the major isoforms in deep abdominal flexor (31% and 65% of the total, respectively) and extensor (46% and 53% of the total, respectively) muscles, with SK6 and SK7 expressed at low levels. These data indicate that fast fibers in cutter claw and abdominal muscles show a phenotypic plasticity with respect to the expression of actin isoforms and may constitute discrete subtypes that differ in contractile properties. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

At lower temperature, neuroplastic changes in mussel ganglia prevailed: a sharp increase in the number of cytosomes in NADPH-d-positive neurons and a sharp decrease in the number of mitochondria in both NADPH-dpositive and NADPH-d-negative neurons. At higher temperature, neurodegenerative changes prevailed: disruption of a part of NADPH-d-negative axons and interneuronal contacts, formation of concentric lamellar structures in the neuropils, and accumulation of autophagosomes in NADPH-d negative neurons. The results suggest that the stress-induced production of nitric oxide in cytosomes of mussel neurons and plasticity of gap junctions have a neuroprotective effect. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

A mechanism for this accumulation and movement is strongly associated with surface currents consisting of the Ekman drift and the geostrophic current, because all floating marine debris is passive to surface currents. The basic published mechanism for the North Pacific is common across the world's ocean. After marine debris accumulates in the narrow Ekman convergence zone, it is moved to the east by geostrophic currents. The most important thing is that floating marine debris concentrates in some specific regions, independent of the initial quantity of marine debris.

abstract = {Learning and memory depend on neuronal alterations induced by electrical activity. Most examples of activity-dependent plasticity, as well as adaptive responses to neuronal injury, have been linked explicitly or implicitly to induction by Ca2+ signals produced by depolarization. Indeed, transient Ca2+ signals are commonly assumed to be the only effective transducers of depolarization into adaptive neuronal responses. Nevertheless, Ca2+-independent depolarization-induced signals might also trigger plastic changes. Establishing the existence of such signals is a challenge because procedures that eliminate Ca2+ transients also impair neuronal viability and tolerance to cellular stress. We have taken advantage of nociceptive sensory neurons in the marine snail Aplysia, which exhibit unusual tolerance to extreme reduction of extracellular and intracellular free Ca 2+ levels. The axons of these neurons exhibit a depolarization- induced memory-like hyperexcitability that lasts a day or longer and depends on local protein synthesis for induction. Here we show that transient localized depolarization of these axons in an excised nerve- ganglion preparation or in dissociated cell culture can induce short- and intermediate-term axonal hyperexcitability as well as long-term protein synthesis- dependent hyperexcitability under conditions in which Ca2+ entry is prevented (by bathing in nominally Ca2+ -free solutions containing EGTA) and detectable Ca2+ transients are eliminated (by adding BAPTA-AM). Disruption of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by pretreatment with thapsigargin also failed to affect induction of axonal hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that unrecognized Ca2+-independent signals exist that can transduce intense depolarization into adaptive cellular responses during neuronal injury, prolonged high-frequency activity, or other sustained depolarizing events.

This study used the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus to test whether Cu resistance can be developed through multigeneration acclimation to elevated Cu levels and whether the resistance has a fitness cost. T. japonicus (F0) were acclimated to three Cu concentrations (0, 10, and 100 $\mu$g l-1) and offspring (F1 and F2) of each treatment were subsequently acclimated at these three concentrations, respectively. Our results evidently indicated that Cu resistance of the copepod was increased even after one generation of acclimation to 100 $\mu$g Cu l-1. The acquired Cu resistance had a fitness cost, as the intrinsic population growth rate of this Cu resistant lineage was significantly lower than the control. The Cu resistance of the offspring from Cu resistant copepods, when raised under control conditions, returned to a level comparable to the control implying a plastic physiological adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Despite the recent discovery of significant genetic structuring in a large number of marine organisms, the evolutionary significance of these often minute genetic differences are still poorly understood. To elucidate the adaptive relevance of low genetic differentiation among marine fish populations, we studied expression differences of osmoregulatory and stress genes in genetically weakly differentiated populations of the European flounder (Platichthys flesus), distributed across a natural salinity gradient. Flounders were maintained in a long-term reciprocal transplantation experiment mimicking natural salinities in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Applying real-time quantitative PCR and microarray analysis we studied expression of four candidate genes (hsp70, angiotensinogen, Na/K-ATPase-$\alpha$ and 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS)) in gill, kidney and liver tissues. Genes involved in osmoregulative processes (Na/K-ATPases-$\alpha$ and angiotensinogen) showed highly plastic but similar expression in the two populations dependent on environmental salinity. However, we observed a unique sixfold up-regulation of hsp70 in kidney tissue of flounder from the North Sea following long-term acclimation to Baltic salinities. Similarly, significant differences between North Sea and Baltic flounders in expression of ALAS in response to different salinities were found in gill and liver tissue. These findings strongly suggest that gene expression in flounders is shaped by adaptation to local environmental conditions. This identification of adaptive differences in high gene flow marine organisms adds a new dimension to our current understanding of evolutionary processes in the sea and is of paramount importance for identification, protection and sustainable management of marine biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

In Aplysia sensory neurons, 5-HT can activate several signal cascades, including PKA and PKC, presumably via distinct types of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the molecular identities of these receptors have not yet been identified. We here report the cloning and functional characterization of a 5-HT receptor that is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase in Aplysia neurons. The cloned receptor, 5-HTapAC1, stimulates the production of cAMP in HEK293T cells and in Xenopus oocytes. Moreover, the knockdown of 5-HTapAC1 expression by RNA interference blocked 5-HT-induced cAMP production in Aplysia sensory neurons and blocked synaptic facilitation in nondepressed or partially depressed sensory-to-motor neuron synapses. These data implicate 5-HTapAC1 as a major modulator of learning related synaptic facilitation in the direct sensory to motor neuron pathway of the gill withdrawal reflex.},

High pCO2 shifted transcript patterns of all genes, resulting in a more synchronized diel expression. Under the same conditions, we did not observe any significant changes in the protein pools or in total cellular allocations of carbon and nitrogen (i.e. C: N ratio remained stable). Independently of temperature, high pCO2 (900 matm) elevated N2 fixation rates. Levels of the key enzymes, nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase that mediate nitrogen assimilation did not increase, implying that the high pCO2 allowed higher reaction turnover rates through these key enzymes. Moreover, increased temperatures and high pCO2 resulted in higher C: P ratios. The plasticity in phosphorous stoichiometry combined with higher enzymatic efficiencies lead to higher growth rates. In cyanobacteria photosynthesis, carbon uptake, respiration, N2 fixation and nitrogen assimilation share cellular components. We propose that shifted cellular resource and energy allocation among those components will enable Trichodesmium grown at elevated temperatures and pCO2 to extend its niche in the future ocean, through both tolerance of a broader temperature range and higher P plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The ability of an organism to acquire O2 from its environment is key to survival and can play an important role in dictating a species' ecological distribution. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to show a tight, phylogenetically independent correlation between hypoxia tolerance, traits involved in dictating O2 extraction capacity and the distribution of a group of closely related fish species, sculpins from the family Cottidae, along the nearshore marine environment. Sculpins with higher hypoxia tolerance, measured as low critical O2 tensions (P crit), inhabit the O2 variable intertidal zones, while species with lower hypoxia tolerance inhabit the more O2 stable subtidal zone or freshwater. Hypoxia tolerance is phylogenetically independently associated with an enhanced O2 extraction capacity, with three principal components accounting for 75 per cent of the variation in P crit: routine O2 consumption rate; mass-specific gill surface area; and whole blood haemoglobin (Hb)-O2-binding affinity (P50). Variation in whole blood Hb-O2P50 is strongly correlated with the intrinsic O2-binding properties of the purified Hb while the differences in the concentration of the allosteric Hb modulators, ATP and GTP, provide a Hb system with substantial plasticity for survival in a highly O2 variable environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

The block copolymers, either alone or in a blend with commercial SEBS (10 wt% SEBS), were spin-coated in thinner films (200-400 nm) on glass and spray-coated in thicker films (∼500 nm) on a SEBS underlayer (150-200 $\mu$m). Angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements proved that at any photoemission angle, $\Phi$, the atomic ratio F/C was larger than that expected from the known stoichiometry. Consistent with the enrichment of the outer film surface (3-10 nm) in F content, the measured contact angles, $\theta$, with water ($\theta$W ≥ 107°) and n-hexadecane (≥h ≥ 64°) pointed to the simultaneous hydrophobic and lipophobic character of the films. The film surface tension $\gamma$s calculated from the $\theta$ values was in the range 13-15 mN/m. However, the XPS measurements on the "wet" films after immersion in water demonstrated that the film surface underwent reconstruction owing to its amphiphilic nature, thereby giving rise to a more chemically heterogeneous structure. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (tapping mode/AC mode) revealed well-defined morphological features of the nanostructured films. Depending on the chemical composition of the block copolymers, spherical (ca. 20 nm diameter) and lying cylindrical (24-29 nm periodicity) nanodomains of the S discrete phase were segregated from the Sz continuous matrix (root-mean-square, rms, roughness ≈ 1 nm). After immersion in water, the underwater AFM patterns evidenced a transformation to a mixed surface structure, in which the nanoscale heterogeneity and topography (rms = 1-6 nm) were increased. The coatings were subjected to laboratory bioassays to explore their intrinsic ability to resist the settlement and reduce the adhesion strength of two marine algae, viz., the macroalga (seaweed) Ulva linza and the unicellular diatom Navicula perminuta. The amphiphilic nature of the copolymer coatings resulted in distinctly different performances against these two organisms. Ulva adhered less strongly to the coatings richer in the amphiphilic polystyrene component, percentage removal being maximal at intermediate weight contents. In contrast, Navicula cells adhered less strongly to coatings with a lower weight percentage of the amphiphilic side chains. The results are discussed in terms of the changes in surface structure caused by immersion and the effects such changes may have on the adhesion of the test organisms. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Synthetic polymers, commonly known as plastics, have been entering the marine environment in quantities paralleling their level of production over the last half century. However, in the last two decades of the 20th Century, the deposition rate accelerated past the rate of production, and plastics are now one of the most common and persistent pollutants in ocean waters and beaches worldwide. Thirty years ago the prevailing attitude of the plastic industry was that "plastic litter is a very small proportion of all litter and causes no harm to the environment except as an eyesore" [Derraik, J.G.B., 2002. The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: a review. Mar. Pollut. Bull. 44(9), 842-852]. Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25-fold, while recovery of the material remained below 5%. Between 1970 and 2003, plastics became the fastest growing segment of the US municipal waste stream, increasing nine-fold, and marine litter is now 60-80% plastic, reaching 90-95% in some areas. While undoubtedly still an eyesore, plastic debris today is having significant harmful effects on marine biota. Albatross, fulmars, shearwaters and petrels mistake floating plastics for food, and many individuals of these species are affected; in fact, 44% of all seabird species are known to ingest plastic. Sea turtles ingest plastic bags, fishing line and other plastics, as do 26 species of cetaceans. In all, 267 species of marine organisms worldwide are known to have been affected by plastic debris, a number that will increase as smaller organisms are assessed. The number of fish, birds, and mammals that succumb each year to derelict fishing nets and lines in which they become entangled cannot be reliably known; but estimates are in the millions. We divide marine plastic debris into two categories: macro, >5 mm and micro, <5 mm. While macro-debris may sometimes be traced to its origin by object identification or markings, micro-debris, consisting of particles of two main varieties, (1) fragments broken from larger objects, and (2) resin pellets and powders, the basic thermoplastic industry feedstocks, are difficult to trace. Ingestion of plastic micro-debris by filter feeders at the base of the food web is known to occur, but has not been quantified. Ingestion of degraded plastic pellets and fragments raises toxicity concerns, since plastics are known to adsorb hydrophobic pollutants. The potential bioavailability of compounds added to plastics at the time of manufacture, as well as those adsorbed from the environment are complex issues that merit more widespread investigation. The physiological effects of any bioavailable compounds desorbed from plastics by marine biota are being directly investigated, since it was found 20 years ago that the mass of ingested plastic in Great Shearwaters was positively correlated with PCBs in their fat and eggs. Colonization of plastic marine debris by sessile organisms provides a vector for transport of alien species in the ocean environment and may threaten marine biodiversity. There is also potential danger to marine ecosystems from the accumulation of plastic debris on the sea floor. The accumulation of such debris can inhibit gas exchange between the overlying waters and the pore waters of the sediments, and disrupt or smother inhabitants of the benthos. The extent of this problem and its effects have recently begun to be investigated. A little more than half of all thermoplastics will sink in seawater. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Anuran tadpoles (Rana pirica) are induced to develop a higher tail and a bulgy body as predator-specific morphological responses when they are exposed to predatory larval salamanders. Subtractive hybridization was performed using induced tadpole body skin and normal tadpoles' body skin. A total of 196 clones showed higher expression, and 104 clones showed lower expression, when they formed bulgy bodies. In the subtraction, carboxypeptidase B, trypsinogen, elastase I, fibrinogen, elastase II, triacyl-glycerol lipase, and $\alpha$1-antitrypsin genes showed lower expression. In contrast, RT-like protein, bullous pemphigoid antigen, phosphoserine aminotransferase, uromodulin, tetranectin, chaperonin-like protein, zinc finger protein, osteonectin, aldehyde dehydrogenase, Sec 23A protein, and ribosomal protein showed higher gene expression. Microarray analysis was also performed using this subtracted cDNA (nine replicates). Results of the microarray data essentially corresponded with those of the subtraction data, and the degree of the suppressed genes was much stronger than that of the expressed genes. Carboxypeptidase B showed the strongest suppression, and its inhibition range was from 1/100 to 3/100 compared with that of control body skin. Strong suppression was also observed with trypsinogen, elastase I, fibrinogen, and elastase II as well. These results can be interpreted as increases of fibrinolysis by strong depression of both carboxypeptidase B and other genes simultaneously, resulting in the retention of blood vessels and facilitating the circulation of blood. Expression was observed in phosphoserine aminotransferase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, RT-related protein, chaperonin-like protein, tetranectin, bullous pemphigoid antigen, uromodulin, and Sec 23A protein. They were significantly (p < 0.05) increased and were at least 1.5 times greater compared with the control. From the appearance, it seems that the bulgy shaped body is highly connecting to the bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen that causes the skin blistering disorder, and tetranectin and uromodulin may be related to the extracell matrix through myogenesis, protein secretion, and ion transport, respectively. Since the RT-related protein gene derived from retrotransposon (L1) is known to disrupt mammalian transcriptomes, retrotransposon may be involved with phenotypic plasticity for morphological defense by Rana prica against predator threat. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Deep-sea vents are the light-independent, highly productive ecosystems driven primarily by chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, in particular by E-Proteobacteria phylogenetically related to important pathogens. We analyzed genomes of two deep-sea vent $\epsilon$-Proteobacteria strains, Sulfurovum sp. NBC37-1 and Nitratiruptor sp. SB155-2, which provide insights not only into their unusual niche on the seafloor, but also into the origins of virulence in their pathogenic relatives, Helicobacter and Campylobacter species. The deep-sea vent $\epsilon$-proteobacterial genomes encode for multiple systems for respiration, sensing and responding to environment, and detoxifying heavy metals, reflecting their adaptation to the deep-sea vent environment. Although they are nonpathogenic, both deep-sea vent $\epsilon$-Proteobacteria share many virulence genes with pathogenic $\epsilon$-Proteobacteria, including genes for virulence factor MviN, hemolysin, invasion antigen CiaB, and the N-linked glycosylation gene cluster. In addition, some virulence determinants (such as the H2-uptake hydrogenase) and genomic plasticity of the pathogenic descendants appear to have roots in deep-sea vent $\epsilon$-Proteobacteria. These provide ecological advantages for hydrothermal vent $\epsilon$-Proteobacteria who thrive in their deep-sea habitat and are essential for both the efficient colonization and persistent infections of their pathogenic relatives. Our comparative genomic analysis suggests that there are previously unrecognized evolutionary links between important human/animal pathogens and their nonpathogenic, symbiotic, chemolithoautotrophic deep-sea relatives. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Pain has a strong emotional-affective dimension, and the amygdala plays a key role in emotionality. Mechanisms of pain-related changes in the amygdala were studied at the cellular and molecular levels in a model of arthritis pain. The influence of the arthritic condition induced in vivo on synaptic transmission and group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1 and mGluR5) function was examined in vitro using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). G-protein-coupled mGluRs are implicated in various forms of neuroplasticity as well as in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Synaptic transmission was evoked by electrical stimulation of afferents from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the pontine parabrachial (PB) area in brain slices from control (untreated or saline-injected) rats and from arthritic rats. This study shows enhanced synaptic transmission of nociceptive-specific inputs (PB→CeA synapse) and polymodal sensory inputs (BLA→CeA CEA synapse) in the arthritis model. CeA neurons from arthritic rats also developed increased excitability compared with control CeA neurons. Synaptic plasticity in the CeA was accompanied by increased presynaptic mGluR1 function and upregulation of mGluR1 and mGluR5. A selective mGluR1 antagonist reduced transmission in CeA neurons from arthritic animals but not in control neurons, and increased levels of mGluR1 and mGluR5 protein were measured in the CeA of arthritic rats compared with controls. Our results show that plastic changes in the amygdala in an arthritis model that produces prolonged pain involve a critical switch of presynaptic mGluR1 expression and function.},

abstract = {In nature, some peptides induce precipitation of silicic acid into silica nanoparticles such as is found in marine algae called diatoms. However, polybasic polymers can act as peptide mimics; one such polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEI), has the advantage that it is stable at room temperature and is inexpensive, in comparison with synthetic peptides. We describe the fabrication and characterization of biosilicate nanoparticles formed by mimicking the peptides using PEI. Brownian motion nanoparticle tracking analysis and field emission gun scanning electron microscopy have been used for the first time to characterize nanoparticles made with tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and PEI to investigate the fundamental factors that affect particle properties. These factors include the effect of phosphate concentration, PEI molecular weight, TMOS concentration, and species of alkoxy-silane used. The properties of the particles are compared with other particles made with polymers that induce silication. Our results show that using PEI gives differences in particle size compared with previous work using other polymers that induce silication. The entrapment of enzymes during the silication process, rationale for using nonphosphate and phosphate buffers during enzyme entrapment, and the analysis of enzyme activity are also presented. Because enzymes can be entrapped during fabrication, it means that there are many future possibilities for the use of silicate nanoparticles containing enzymes, such as biosensors and biocatalytic reactors. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

It is thus pertinent to develop methods for obtaining and cultivation of macrophages and assessing their functions in the spotted wolffish, a cold water species of current interest for the aquaculture industry. Kidney macrophages from the spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor Olafsen) were isolated by density sedimentation using Percoll. The cells were highly phagocytic and possessed typical macrophage morphology evaluated by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Using electron microscopic analysis, the size of the macrophages, collected from the Percoll density interface, was 5-9 $\mu$m. The viability in vitro was highest (87.1%) when the cells were kept at 13°C with the addition of synthetic serum replacement (SSR-2) when measured 24 h after seeding. One day old cells were not significantly activated by addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h when measured by reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium compared to control cells.

abstract = {There is considerable concern about the hazards that plastic debris presents to wildlife. Use of polymers that degrade more quickly than conventional plastics presents a possible solution to this problem. Here we investigate breakdown of two oxo-biodegradable plastics, compostable plastic and standard polyethylene in the marine environment. Tensile strength of all materials decreased during exposure, but at different rates. Compostable plastic disappeared from our test rig between 16 and 24 weeks whereas approximately 98% of the other plastics remained after 40 weeks. Some plastics require UV light to degrade. Transmittance of UV through oxo-biodegradable and standard polyethylene decreased as a consequence of fouling such that these materials received ∼90% less UV light after 40 weeks. Our data indicate that compostable plastics may degrade relatively quickly compared to oxo-biodegradable and conventional plastics. While degradable polymers offer waste management solutions, there are limitations to their effectiveness in reducing hazards associated with plastic debris. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Exposure of marine animals to certain organic and metal pollutants is thought to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with concomitant alterations of antioxidant defence mechanisms. Some of these organic pollutants cause peroxisome proliferation, a process resulting also in possible enhanced production of ROS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of two organic xenobiotics, benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), as well as the effects of cadmium (Cd), on antioxidant and peroxisomal enzymes and on peroxisomal volume density in the digestive gland of mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk., experimentally exposed for 21 days. Special attention was paid to the interactive effects of organic and metal compounds by exposing one group of mussels to a mixture of B(a)P and Cd. Exposure of mussels to Cd caused a decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, in Mn-SOD protein levels and in volume density of peroxisomes. B(a)P exposure significantly increased catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and inhibited Mn-SOD after 21 days of exposure. B(a)P also caused a slight increase in acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) activity and peroxisomal volume density after 21 days of exposure. Cd tended to inhibit changes provoked by B(a)P, indicating that responses to organic xenobiotics can be modulated by concomitant exposure to metal contaminants. Exposure to DEHP increased catalase and AOX and inhibited SOD activity and Mn-SOD protein levels. In conclusion, peroxisome proliferation, measured as an increase of the peroxisomal enzymes catalase and AOX (up to 1.53-fold for AOX), is a specific response to organic contaminants such as B(a)P and DEHP, whereas Cd does not cause peroxisome proliferation. Thus, peroxisome proliferation may be a specific biomarker of organic pollutants in mussels. Both organic and metal pollutants inhibited SOD activity and protein levels (up to 0.21-fold for Mn-SOD protein levels), the latter offering potential as general marker of pollution.},

Protease and amylase activities were found in the gastric juice while esterase and lipase activities were higher in the digestive gland. Trypsin-like activity was higher than chymotrypsin-like activity in the gastric juice and digestive gland. Stability and optimal conditions for digestive enzyme activities were examined under different pHs, temperature and ionic strength. The use of protease inhibitors showed the prevalence of serine proteases and metalloproteases. Results for serine proteases were corroborated by zymograms where several isotrypsins-like (17-21 kDa) and isochymotrypsin-like enzymes (23-38 kDa) were identified. Amylases (38-47 kDa) were detected in zymograms and a complex array of non-specific esterases isoenzymes was found in the digestive gland. Isoenzyme polymorphism was found for trypsin, amylase, and esterase. This study is the first to evidence the biochemical bases of the plasticity in feeding habits of P. argus.

abstract = {This review discusses the ways in which comparative genomics can contribute to the study of fish endocrinology. First, the phylogenetic position of fish and an overview of their specific endocrine systems are presented. The emphasis will be on teleosts because they are the most abundant fishes and because most data are available for this group. Second, the complexity of fish genomics is reviewed. With the vast array of genome sizes and ploidy levels, assignment of gene orthology is more difficult in fish, but this is an absolute prerequisite in functional analysis and it is important to be aware of such genome plasticity when cloning genes. The ease with which a gene is cloned at the genomic level is directly related to genome size and complexity, a factor that is not known in the majority of fish species. Finally, the methodology is presented along with specific examples of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (a previously unidentified hormone in fish), calcium-sensing receptor, and calcitonin (with a duplication of this particular ligand in Fugu rubripes). Preliminary data also suggest that there are further duplicated genes in the calcium regulatory system. Comparative genomics has provided a valuable approach for isolating and characterizing a range of fish genes involved in calcium regulation. However, for understanding the physiology and endocrine regulation of this system, particularly with regard to gene duplication, an alternative approach is required in which conventional endocrinology techniques will play a significant role. {\textcopyright} 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).},

The ability of four different microorganisms to immobilize on PUF and to degrade various petroleum products (Arabian light crude (ALC), Al-Shaheen crude (ASC), diesel and oil slops) was assessed by measuring the n-alkane fraction remaining in the petroleum products over time. A Rhodococcus sp. (designated as F92) had the highest number of immobilized viable cells (109 cells per cm3 PUF) and a maximum attachment efficiency of 90% on PUF of a density of 14 kg/m3. Scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of extracellular structures that could play an important role in the immobilization of F92 on PUF. Analysis by GC-MS revealed that both free and immobilized F92 cells were able to degrade approximately 90% of the total n-alkanes in the petroleum products tested within 1 week at 30°C. Rhodococcus sp. F92 was efficiently immobilized onto PUF and the immobilized cells were able to degrade a variety of petroleum products such as ALC, ASC, diesel and oil slops.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polyesters synthesized by microorganisms, possess such desired features. Industrial production of PHAs is currently achieved using recombinant Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, recent research on halophiles, salt requiring microorganisms, has shown a remarkable potential for biotechnological production of PHAs. The halophilic archaeon Haloferax mediterranei accumulates a co-polymer, i.e., poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) in large amounts using glucose, starch, and hydrolyzed whey as carbon sources. Chemical composition and molecular weight of PHAs produced by H. mediterranei can be modified depending on the substrate utilized as precursor. Phylogenetic studies on haloarchaeal enzymes able to polymerize the components of PHAs (i.e., PHA synthases) reveal a novel cluster, with a close relationship with PHA polymerases of bacteria and archaea found in marine-related niches. On the other hand, sequences of PHA synthases of two halophilic bacteria are more closely affiliated to synthases of Proteobacteria. Several bacterial species of the family Halomonadaceae accumulate PHAs. Halomonas boliviensis reached PHA yields and volumetric productivities close to the highest reported so far. Furthermore, H. boliviensis and other Halomonas species are able to co-produce PHA and osmolytes, i.e., ectoines and hydroxyectoine, in one process. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Here we present the first complete genome of a metabolically versatile representative, strain EbN1, which metabolizes various aromatic compounds, including hydrocarbons. A circular chromosome (4.3 Mb) and two plasmids (0.21 and 0.22 Mb) encode 4603 predicted proteins. Ten anaerobic and four aerobic aromatic degradation pathways were recognized, with the encoding genes mostly forming clusters. The presence of paralogous gene clusters (e.g., for anaerobic phenylacetate oxidation), high sequence similarities to orthologs from other strains (e.g., for anaerobic phenol metabolism) and frequent mobile genetic elements (e.g., more than 200 genes for transposases) suggest high genome plasticity and extensive lateral gene transfer during metabolic evolution of strain EbN1. Metabolic versatility is also reflected by the presence of multiple respiratory complexes. A large number of regulators, including more than 30 two-component and several FNR-type regulators, indicate a finely tuned regulatory network able to respond to the fluctuating availability of organic substrates and electron acceptors in the environment. The absence of genes required for nitrogen fixation and specific interaction with plants separates strain EbN1 ecophysiologically from the closely related nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts of the Azoarcus cluster.

abstract = {Recent research in a variety of systems indicates that memory formation can involve the activation of a wide range of molecular cascades. In assessing this recent work it is clear that no single cascade is uniquely important for all forms of memory, nor is a single form of memory uniquely dependent on a single cascade. Rather, it appears that molecular networks are differentially engaged in the induction of various forms of memory. Despite this highly interactive array of possible cascades, specific 'molecular nodes' have emerged as critical regulatory points in memory formation. Functionally, these nodes can operate in two sequential steps, beginning with a convergence of inputs which coordinately influence the activation state of the node, in which the nature of stimulation determines the dynamics of nodal activity, followed by a divergence of substrate selection, in which the node serves as a gateway that activates specific downstream effectors. Finally, specific nodes can be differentially engaged (i.e. have different 'weights') depending upon the nature and pattern of the activating stimulus. The marine mollusk Aplysia has proven useful for a molecular analysis of memory formation. We will use this system to highlight some of the molecular strategies employed by the nervous system in the formation of memory for sensitization, and we will focus on extracellular signal-related kinase as a candidate node integral to these processes. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, 2006.},

It was observed that the porosity of the fiber assemblies played a very important role in determining its oil sorption capacity. The polypropylene fiber assembly exhibited the highest sorption capacity (g/g) followed by the kapok and milkweed fiber assemblies at porosity <0.98. At higher porosities (above 0.98), polypropylene filled fiber assembly has poor sorption capacity due to large sized inter fiber pore. The kapok and milkweed fibers have intra fiber porosities of 0.81 and 0.83, respectively. All the fiber assemblies showed higher oil sorption capacity with the high density oil as compared to the diesel oil. As the kapok and milkweed fiber have low cellulose content, hence their slow degradation is an advantage in fresh and marine water applications. The good sorption capacity of kapok and milkweed fiber assemblies along with their bio-degradable nature offer great scope for structuring them into fiber assemblies with large porosity and uniform pores to have efficient oil sorbents. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Skeletonema marinoi produces 2,4-heptadienal, 2,4-octadienal, and 2,4,7-octatrienal, the latter only in traces. In nutrient-replete cultures, the production of potentially defensive polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUA) increases from the exponential to the stationary phase of growth from 1.2 fmol cell-1 (±0.4 fmol cell-1 SD) to 4.2 fmol cell-1 (±1.0 fmol cell-1 SD), with 2,4-heptadienal as the dominant aldehyde. The plasticity of PUA production with age of the culture supports the hypothesis of a direct link between toxin production and cell physiological state. N- and P-limited cells in stationary phase produced 1.4 and 1.8 fold higher amounts of PUA than control cultures and 10.7 and 4.6 times higher PUAs when compared to their own exponential growth phase, respectively. The increase in PUA production in the nutrient-limited cultures was not paralleled by an increase in the total amount of precursor fatty acids indicating that physiological stress might trigger an enhanced expression or activity of the enzymes responsible for PUA production, i.e. chemical defense increase in aged and nutrient-stressed diatoms. If this holds true during blooms, grazers feeding at the end of a bloom would be more affected than early-bloom grazers. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Tame behaviour, i.e. low wariness, in terrestrial island species is often attributed to low predation pressure. However, we know little about its physiological control and its flexibility in the face of predator introductions. Marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) on the Galapagos Islands are a good model to study the physiological correlates of low wariness. They have lived virtually without predation for 5-15 Myr until some populations were first confronted with feral cats and dogs some 150 years ago. We tested whether and to what extent marine iguanas can adjust their behaviour and endocrine stress response to novel predation threats. Here, we show that a corticosterone stress response to experimental chasing is absent in naive animals, but is quickly restored with experience. Initially, low wariness also increases with experience, but remains an order of magnitude too low to allow successful escape from introduced predators. Our data suggest that the ability of marine iguanas to cope with predator introductions is limited by narrow reaction norms for behavioural wariness rather than by constraints in the underlying physiological stress system. In general, we predict that island endemics show flexible physiological stress responses but are restricted by narrow behavioural plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

Of the three commercial forms (Penta, Octa and Deca) of PBDEs that have been widely used as flame retardants in textiles, furniture upholstery, plastics, and electronics, only Deca-BDE remains on the general market in North America, while a recent ruling of the European Court spells an impending end to its use in Europe. We review here highlights of aquatic research documenting the rapid emergence of PBDEs as a high priority environmental concern in Canada. PBDEs are being introduced in large quantities to the aquatic environment through sewage discharge and atmospheric deposition. In certain environmental compartments, the single congener BDE-209, the main ingredient in the Deca-BDE formulation, has surpassed the legacy PCBs and DDT as the top contaminant by concentration. Limited biomagnification of BDE-209 in aquatic food webs reflects its high log Kow and preferential partitioning into the particle phase. As a result, large environmental reservoirs of BDE-209 are being created in sediments, and these may present a long-term threat to biota: BDE-209 breaks down into more persistent, more bioaccumulative, more toxic, and more mobile PBDE congeners in the environment.

abstract = {Many marine invertebrates reproduce through a larval stage. The settlement and metamorphosis of most of the species are synchronised and induced by environmental organisms, mainly bacteria. The hydrozoan Hydractinia echinata has become a model organism for metamorphosis of marine invertebrates. In this species, bacteria, e.g. Pseudoalteromonas espejiana, are the natural inducers of metamorphosis. Like in other species of marine invertebrates, metamorphosis can be induced artificially by monovalent cations, e.g. Cs+. In this study, we present systematic data that metamorphosis - with both inducing compounds, the natural one from bacteria and the artificial one Cs+ - are indeed similar with respect to (a) the morphological progression, (b) the localisation of the primary induction signal in the larva, (c) the pattern of apoptotic cells occurring during the initial 10 h of metamorphosis and (d) the disappearance of RFamide-dependent immunocytochemical signals in sensory neurons during this process. However, a difference occurs during the development of the anterior end, insofar as apoptotic cells and settlement appear earlier in planulae induced with bacteria. Thus, basically, Cs+ may be used as an artificial inducer, mimicking the natural process. However, differences in the appearance of apoptotic cells and in settlement raise the question of how enormous developmental plasticity in hydrozoans actually can be, and how this is related to the absence of malignant devolution in hydrozoans. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

Furthermore, it was determined whether an anaerobic baffled reactor would promote phase separation and if additive of bentonite or granular active carbon was capable of enhancing granule formation. In order to minimize feed variations, and have a totally biodegradable substrate, a synthetic sucrose substrate was used. Granulation was achieved in both reactors within 75 days. However, the granules from the granular active carbon amended reactor appeared earlier and were larger and more compact. The reactors were maintained at a hydraulic retention time of 20 h during performance study stage. The results showed that when organic loading rate were changed from 2.15 to 6.29 kg COD m-3 day-1, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was not decreased (91-93%), but a slight increase in effluent COD was observed. It was found that the COD removals were generally good (87-92%) and had not obviously change with the decreasing NaHCO 3/COD ratios. From the bacterial distribution and the concentration of volatile fatty acids in four compartments, it was concluded that a separation of phases occurred within the anaerobic baffled reactors.},

abstract = {Effects of latitudinal cold adaptation and cold acclimation on metabolic rates and aerobic scope were studied in the eurythermal marine gastropod Littorina saxatilis from temperate North Sea and sub-arctic White Sea areas. Animals were acclimated for 6-8 weeks at control temperature (13°C) or at 4°C, and their respiration rates were measured during acute temperature change (1-1.5°C h-1) in a range between 0°C and 32°C. In parallel, the accumulation of anaerobic end products and changes in energy status were monitored. Starting from 0°C, aerobic metabolic rates of L. saxatilis rose quickly with increasing temperatures up to a point at or slightly above the respective acclimation temperature. Beyond this value, thermal sensitivity of oxygen consumption rate (V̇O2) greatly decreased in a wide, 15°C range of experimental temperatures. This change in metabolic regulation was also reflected in the activation energy of aerobic metabolism (Ea), which was approximately seven times lower at temperatures above Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABTs) than at temperatures below ABTs. Warming progressively led to a discrepancy between energy demand and energy production, as demonstrated by a decrease in the levels of high-energy phosphates [phosho-L-arginine (PLA) and ATP], and resulted in the onset of anaerobiosis at critically high temperatures, indicating a limitation of aerobic scope. The comparison of aerobic and anaerobic metabolic rates in L. saxatilis in air and water suggests that the heat-induced onset of anaerobiosis is due to the insufficient oxygen supply to tissues at high temperatures. Cold acclimation led to an increase in aerobic metabolic rates and a considerable downward shift of the upper critical temperature in North Sea L. saxatilis but not in White Sea L. saxatilis. Limited metabolic plasticity in response to cold acclimation in sub-arctic White Sea snails as compared with their temperate North Sea counterparts suggests that metabolic depression occurs during overwintering under the more extreme winter conditions at the White Sea.},

In this paper, the successful engineering of the biomass crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) for the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is reported. Polymer production was monitored in more than 400 primary transformants grown under in vitro and glasshouse conditions. Plants containing up to 3.72% dry weight of PHB in leaf tissues and 1.23% dry weight of PHB in whole tillers were obtained. Results from the analysis of the polymer distribution at the cellular and whole plant levels are presented, and target areas for the improvement of PHB production are highlighted. Polymer accumulation was also analysed in the T 1 generation obtained from controlled crosses of transgenic plants. This study presents the first successful expression of a functional multigene pathway in switchgrass, and demonstrates that this high-yielding biomass crop is amenable to the complex metabolic engineering strategies necessary to produce high-value biomaterials with lignocellulose-derived biofuels. {\textcopyright} 2008 Metabolix, Inc.},

abstract = {Histone posttranslational modifications mediate establishment of structurally and functionally distinct chromatin compartments of eukaryotic nuclei. The association of different histone modifications with euchromatic and heterochromatic compartments is relatively conserved in highly divergent model organisms such as Drosophila and mammals. However, some differences between these model systems have been uncovered while limited data are available from organisms nearer the invertebrate-vertebrate transition. We identified a chromatin compartment in both diploid and endocycling cells of the urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, enriched in heterochromatic histone modifications and DNA methylation. Surprisingly, this compartment also contained high levels of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3 Me3K4), a modification thus far associated with actively transcribed sequences. Although in Drosophila and mouse cells, H3 Me3K4 was prevalently associated with euchromatin, we also detected it in their pericentromeric heterochromatin. We further showed that H3 Me3K4 abundance was not necessarily proportional to local levels of transcriptional activity in either euchromatin or heterochromatin. Our data indicate greater plasticity across evolution in the association of histone lysine methylation with functionally distinct chromatin domains than previously thought and suggest that H3 Me3K4 participates in additional processes beyond marking transcriptionally active chromatin. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer.},

abstract = {Advances in our understanding of the physiology and metabolism of Northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica have been sporadic but significant. Despite problems with keeping M. norvegica in good condition in the laboratory, those who have tried, and succeeded, have contributed to a better knowledge of krill biology and challenged our understanding of some basic biological processes. Most recent work has been concentrated in the fields of digestive physiology, lipid biochemistry, respiration and anaerobiosis, metabolic properties, and pollutants. M. norvegica is capable of digesting an opportunistic, omnivorous diet, showing some digestive enzyme polymorphism and high levels of enzyme activity, the latter varying with season. It also seems capable of digesting cellulose and hemicelluloses, for example, laminarin. The biochemical composition of krill is relatively well known with some recent extensive work focusing on the previously little studied lipid and fatty acid composition, particularly with reference to reproduction, overwintering energy storage and as a nutrition marker. A high aerobic metabolism (but poor anaerobic capacity) is characteristic of M. norvegica, and how this is affected by temperature, low O2, and season has attracted some attention, particularly in the context of diel vertical migration (DVM) across pronounced pycnoclines. Despite determining high metabolic turnover rates and a high physiological plasticity for this species, we know little of the regulative potential of metabolites, particularly their modulative effect on enzyme activity. Certainly a modest ability to maintain aerobic metabolism when encountering hypoxia, and little or no ability to osmoregulate in hyposaline conditions, does not prevent DVM in adults of this species. The ability to maintain aerobic metabolism develops early in ontogeny at about furcilia III (i.e. concurrent with first DVM behaviour). The respiratory pigment of M. norvegica, haemocyanin, has a low O2 affinity and high temperature sensitivity (although temperature has the opposite effect on O2 binding than found for nearly every other haemocyanin). Also surprising is the apparent use of haemocyanin as an energy source/store. While recent work has focused on physiological effects, the ecophysiological effects of transuric elements and trace metals, the effects of pollution generally are widely understudied. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Desulfobacterium autotrophicum HRM2 is the first member of this ecophysiologically important group with a now available genome sequence. With 5.6 megabasepairs (Mbp) the genome of Db. autotrophicum HRM2 is about 2 Mbp larger than the sequenced genomes of other sulfate reducers (SRB). A high number of genome plasticity elements (> 100 transposon-related genes), several regions of GC discontinuity and a high number of repetitive elements (132 paralogous genes Mbp-1) point to a different genome evolution when comparing with Desulfovibrio spp. The metabolic versatility of Db. autotrophicum HRM2 is reflected in the presence of genes for the degradation of a variety of organic compounds including long-chain fatty acids and for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which enables the organism to completely oxidize acetyl-CoA to CO2 but also to grow chemolithoautotrophically. The presence of more than 250 proteins of the sensory/regulatory protein families should enable Db. autotrophicum HRM2 to efficiently adapt to changing environmental conditions. Genes encoding periplasmic or cytoplasmic hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases have been detected as well as genes for the transmembrane TpII-c3, Hme and Rnf complexes. Genes for subunits A, B, C and D as well as for the proposed novel subunits L and F of the heterodisulfide reductases are present.

Black-footed and Laysan albatrosses from the North Pacific Ocean contained higher levels of PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs than albatrosses from the Southern Ocean, indicating that emission sources of these contaminants were predominant in the northern hemisphere. Residue levels in albatrosses from the remote North Pacific Ocean far from the point source of pollution were comparable to or higher than those in terrestrial and coastal birds from contaminated areas in developed nations, suggesting the specific exposure and accumulation of PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs in albatross. The long life span and ingestion of plastic resin pellets by albatrosses could be the plausible explanations for the elevated accumulation of persistent and lipophilic contaminants including PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs in these birds. Relative proportions of PCDFs and coplanar PCBs in albatross were higher than those observed in birds inhabiting terrestrial and coastal areas, suggesting that these toxic chemicals may have higher transportability by air and water than PCDDs. Congener patterns of PCDD/Fs in albatross showed less variability as compared to those in terrestrial species, indicating that contamination patterns of PCDD/Fs were similar within the open ocean environment. Contributions of PCDD/Fs to total TEQs in albatrosses from the open ocean were generally lower than those in terrestrial birds, suggesting different toxic potency of PCDD/Fs and coplanar PCBs on animals inhabiting open ocean and terrestrial environment. Whereas albatrosses from southern oceans retained lower TEQ concentrations, possible adverse effects of PCDD/ Fs and coplanar PCBs to black-footed and Laysan albatrosses of the North Pacific Ocean may be suspected from TEQ levels.},

abstract = {The milkfish (Chanos chanos) is an economic species in Southeast Asia. In Taiwan, the milkfish are commercially cultured in environments of various salinities. Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) is a key enzyme for fish iono- and osmoregulation. When compared with gills, NKA and its potential role were less examined by different approaches in the other osmoregulatory organs (e.g., kidney) of euryhaline teleosts. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between osmoregulatory plasticity and renal NKA in this euryhaline species. Muscle water contents (MWC), plasma, and urine osmolality, kidney histology, as well as distribution, expression (mRNA and protein), and specific activity of renal NKA were examined in juvenile milkfish acclimated to fresh water (FW), seawater (SW 35‰), and hypersaline water (HSW 60‰) for at least two weeks before experiments. MWC showed no significant difference among all groups. Plasma osmolality was maintained within the range of physiological homeostasis in milkfish acclimated to different salinities, while, urine osmolality of FW-acclimated fish was evidently lower than SW- and HSW-acclimated individuals. The renal tubules were identified by staining with periodic acid Schiff's reagent and hematoxylin. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining showed that NKA was distributed in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules, distal tubules, and collecting tubules, but not in glomeruli, of milkfish exposed to different ambient salinities. The highest abundance of relative NKA $\alpha$ subunit mRNA was found in FW-acclimated milkfish rather than SW- and HSW-acclimated individuals. Furthermore, relative protein amounts of renal NKA $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits as well as NKA-specific activity were also found to be higher in the FW group than SW and the HSW groups. This study integrated diverse levels (i.e., histological distribution, gene, protein, and specific activity) of renal NKA expression and illustrated the potential role of NKA in triggering ion reabsorption in kidneys of the marine euryhaline milkfish when acclimated to a hypotonic FW environment. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Some of these compounds are added during plastics manufacture, while others adsorb from the surrounding seawater. Concentrations of hydrophobic contaminants adsorbed on plastics showed distinct spatial variations reflecting global pollution patterns. Model calculations and experimental observations consistently show that polyethylene accumulates more organic contaminants than other plastics such as polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride. Both amathematical model using equilibrium partitioning and experimental data have demonstrated the transfer of contaminants from plastic to organisms. A feeding experiment indicated that PCBs could transfer from contaminated plastics to streaked shearwater chicks. Plasticizers, other plastics additives and constitutional monomers also present potential threats in terrestrial environments because they can leach fromwaste disposal sites into groundwater and/or surfacewaters. Leaching and degradation of plasticizers and polymers are complex phenomena dependent on environmental conditions in the landfill and the chemical properties of each additive. Bisphenol A concentrations in leachates from municipal waste disposal sites in tropical Asia ranged from sub $\mu$g l-1 to $\mu$g l-1 and were correlated with the level of economic development. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that elevated nitric oxide (NO) reduces adhesion in diatom, bacterial and animal cells. This article reports experiments designed to investigate whether elevated NO reduces the adhesion of zoospores of the green alga Ulva, an important fouling species. Surface-normalised values of NO were measured using the fluorescent indicator DAF-FM DA and parallel hydrodynamic measurements of adhesion strength were made. Elevated levels of NO caused by the addition of the exogenous NO donor SNAP reduced spore settlement by 20% and resulted in lower adhesion strength. Addition of the NO scavenger cPTIO abolished the effects of SNAP on adhesion. The strength of attachment and NO production by spores in response to four coatings (Silastic T2; Intersleek 700; Intersleek 900 and polyurethane) shows that reduced adhesion is correlated with an increase in NO production. It is proposed that in spores of Ulva, NO is used as an intracellular signalling molecule to detect how conducive a surface is for settlement and adhesion. The effect of NO on the adhesion of a range of organisms suggests that NO-releasing coatings could have the potential to control fouling.},

abstract = {Embryos of the marine killifish Fundulus heteroclitus are adapted to survive aerially. However, it is unknown if they are able to control development under dehydration conditions. Here, we show that air-exposed blastula embryos under saturated relative humidity were able to stimulate development, and hence the time of hatching was advanced with respect to embryos continuously immersed in seawater. Embryos exposed to air at later developmental stages did not hatch until water was added, while development was not arrested. Air-exposed embryos avoided dehydration probably because of their thickened egg envelope, although it suffered significant evaporative water loss. The potential role of aquaporins as part of the embryo response to dehydration was investigated by cloning the aquaporin-0 (FhAqp0), -1a (FhAqp1a), and -3 (FhAqp3) cDNAs. Functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that FhaAqp1a was a water-selective channel, whereas FhAqp3 was permeable to water, glycerol, and urea. Expression of fhaqp0 and fhaqp1a was prominent during organogenesis, and their mRNA levels were similar between water- and air-incubated embryos. However, fhaqp3 transcripts were highly and transiently accumulated during gastrulation, and the protein product was localized in the basolateral membrane of the enveloping epithelial cell layer and in the membrane of ingressing and migrating blastomers. Interestingly, both fhaqp3 transcripts and FhAqp3 polypeptides were downregulated in air-exposed embryos. These data demonstrate that killifish embryos respond adaptively to environmental desiccation by accelerating development and that embryos are able to transduce dehydration conditions into molecular responses. The reduced synthesis of FhAqp3 may be one of these mechanisms to regulate water and/or solute transport in the embryo. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {The preferential synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in response to thermal stress [the heat shock response (HSR)] has been shown to vary in species that occupy different thermal environments. A survey of case studies of aquatic (mostly marine) organisms occupying stable thermal environments at all latitudes, from polar to tropical, shows that they do not in general respond to heat stress with an inducible HSR. Organisms that occupy highly variable thermal environments (variations up to >20°C), like the intertidal zone, induce the HSR frequently and within the range of body temperatures they normally experience, suggesting that the response is part of their biochemical strategy to occupy this thermal niche. The highest temperatures at which these organisms can synthesize Hsps are only a few degrees Celsius higher than the highest body temperatures they experience. Thus, they live close to their thermal limits and any further increase in temperature is probably going to push them beyond those limits. In comparison, organisms occupying moderately variable thermal environments (<10°C), like the subtidal zone, activate the HSR at temperatures above those they normally experience in their habitats. They have a wider temperature range above their body temperature range over which they can synthesize Hsps. Contrary to our expectations, species from highly (in comparison with moderately) variable thermal environments have a limited acclimatory plasticity. Due to this variation in the HSR, species from stable and highly variable environments are likely to be more affected by climate change than species from moderately variable environments. {\textcopyright} 2010, Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract = {The degree to which temperature acclimation modifies the acute synthesis of the entire heat-shock protein (Hsp) complement is still unknown, but it may constitute an important mechanism for understanding the differences in acclimation ability among closely related ectothermic species that occupy widely varying thermal environments. In general, eurythermal (heat-tolerant) species modify physiological function in response to an increase in acclimation temperature to a greater extent than stenothermal (heat-sensitive) species. In the present work I used 35S-labelled amino acids and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to test this assumption for how acclimation affects acute Hsp expression (referred to as phenotypic plasticity) in two heat-sensitive, low-intertidal to subtidal zone turban snails, Tegula brunnea and T. montereyi, in comparison to a heat-tolerant, mid- to low-intertidal zone congener, T. funebralis. I was able (i) to detect the synthesis of over 30 proteins in gill tissue, primarily in the 70 kDa range, in response to an increase in temperature (13°C, 24°C, 27°C and 30°C), (ii) to assess the effect of acclimation (13°C vs 22°C) on acute Hsp synthesis, and (iii) to compare this effect among the three Tegula congeners. After increasing acclimation temperature from 13°C to 22°C, synthesis of the most highly expressed Hsps decreased more in T. brunnea and T. montereyi than in T. funebralis. Two highly expressed proteins of molecular mass 71 and 74 kDa, however, were also synthesized constitutively at 13°C and changed with increasing acclimation temperature in all three species. Although similar in phenotypic plasticity, T. brunnea and T. montereyi synthesized either a 76 or a 72 kDa cluster of proteins, respectively, and differed in how acclimation affected the acute synthesis of several 77 kDa proteins. Thus, in Tegula, the effect of acclimation on Hsp expression is (i) Hsp-specific, (ii) dependent on a protein's expression pattern (constitutive and inducible vs only inducible), (iii) and is actually limited in the more eurythermal mid- to low-intertidal congener. These results contradict the general assumption that greater heat tolerance correlates with an increased ability to modify physiological function in response to acclimation.},

abstract = {The Arctic and Antarctic marine faunas differ by age and isolation. Fishes of the two polar regions have undergone different regional histories that have driven the physiological diversities. Antarctic fish are highly stenothermal, in keeping with stable water temperatures, whereas Arctic fish, being exposed to seasonal temperature variations, exhibit higher physiological plasticity. This study reports the characterization of the oxygen transport system of three Arctic species of the family Gadidae, namely the Arctic cod Arctogadus glacialis, the polar cod Boreogadus saida, and the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. Unlike Antarctic notothenioids, the blood displays high multiplicity, i.e. it has three hemoglobins, similar to many other acanthomorph teleosts. In the most abundant hemoglobin, oxygen binding is modulated by heterotropic effectors, with marked Bohr and Root effects. Remarkably, in two species (A. glacialis and B. saida), the Hill coefficient is very close to one in the whole pH range, indicating the apparent absence of cooperativity. The amino acid sequences have been used to gain insight into the evolution history of globins of polar fish. The results indicate that Arctic and Antarctic globins have different phylogenies and lead us to suggest that the selective pressure of environment stability allows the phylogenetic signal to be maintained in the Antarctic sequences, whereas environmental variability would tend to disrupt this signal in the Gadidae sequences. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {The discovery that dendrites of neurons in the mammalian brain possess the capacity for protein synthesis [1] stimulated interest in the potential role of local, postsynaptic protein synthesis in learning-related synaptic plasticity [2]. But it remains unclear how local, postsynaptic protein synthesis actually mediates learning and memory in mammals. Accordingly, we examined whether learning in an invertebrate, the marine snail Aplysia, involves local, postsynaptic protein synthesis. Previously, we showed that the dishabituation and sensitization of the defensive withdrawal reflex in Aplysia [3, 4] require elevated postsynaptic Ca2+, postsynaptic exocytosis, and functional upregulation of postsynaptic $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors [5]. Here, we tested whether the synaptic facilitation that underlies dishabituation and sensitization in Aplysia [6] requires local, postsynaptic protein synthesis. We found that the facilitatory transmitter, serotonin (5-HT), enhanced the response of the motor neuron to glutamate, the sensory neuron transmitter, and this enhancement depended on rapid protein synthesis. By using individual motor neurites surgically isolated from their cell bodies, we showed that the 5-HT-dependent protein synthesis occurred locally. Finally, by blocking postsynaptic protein synthesis, we disrupted the facilitation of the sensorimotor synapse. By demonstrating its critical role in a synaptic change that underlies learning and memory in a major model invertebrate system, our study suggests that local, postsynaptic protein synthesis is of fundamental importance to the cell biology of learning. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The marine nitrogen (N) cycle is a complex network of biological transformations in different N pools. The linkages among these different reservoirs are often poorly understood. Traditional methods for measuring N uptake rely on bulk community properties and cannot provide taxonomic information. 15N-based stable isotope probing (SIP), however, is a technique that allows detection of uptake of individual N sources by specific microorganisms. In this study we used 15N SIP methodology to assess the use of different nitrogen substrates by Synechococcus spp. and diatoms on the west Florida shelf. Seawater was incubated in the presence of 15N-labeled ammonium, nitrate, urea, glutamic acid, and a mixture of 16 amino acids. DNA was extracted and fractionated using CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the amounts of Synechococcus and diatom DNA as a function of density, and 15N tracer techniques were used to measure rates of N uptake by the microbial community. The ammonium, nitrate, urea, and dissolved primary amine uptake rates were 0.077, 0.065, 0.013, and 0.055 $\mu$mol N liter-1 h-1, respectively. SIP data indicated that diatoms and Synechococcus spp. actively incorporated N from [15N]nitrate, [15N]ammonium, and [15N]urea. Synechococcus also incorporated nitrogen from [15N]glutamate and 15N-amino acids, but no evidence indicating uptake of labeled amino acids by diatoms was detected. These data suggest that N flow in communities containing Synechococcus spp. and diatoms has more plasticity than the new-versus-recycled production paradigm suggests and that these phytoplankters should not be viewed strictly as recycled and new producers, respectively.

abstract = {Trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) at synapses has been suggested to play an important role in the expression of synaptic plasticity. Both the regulated and the constitutive trafficking of synaptic AMPARs are thought to involve the insertion and removal of receptors by means of an exocytotic and endocytotic process, respectively. In contrast, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs), which are colocalized with AMPARs at excitatory synapses, appear to be much less dynamic. Here, we present evidence supporting the idea that synaptic AMPARs turn over through a constitutive endocytotic process and that glutamate application greatly enhances this turnover of AMPARs. The glutamate-induced internalization of AMPARs requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca(2+). The AMPAR internalization is mimicked by latrunculin A, a drug that selectively depolymerizes actin and is blocked by jasplakinolide, a drug which stabilizes actin filaments. The rate of endocytosis is not altered by glutamate application, whereas a clear enhancement is observed with insulin application. We propose a model in which the glutamate-induced dissociation of AMPARs from their anchor on the postsynaptic membrane involves actin depolymerization, which allows the released AMPARs to segregate from the NMDARs and diffuse to a presumably perisynaptic site, where they become available to an endocytotic machinery and are selectively internalized.},

Alpha 2 and $\beta$ adrenoceptors were studied at different developmental stages by using [3H]clonidine and [ 3H]dihydroalprenolol, respectively, by means of in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Furthermore, immunohistochemical localization of the receptor subtypes was performed to determine their cellular distribution. Saturation studies determined a high-affinity component of [3H]clonidine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites. High levels of both receptors were found in preglomerular complex, ventral hypothalamus, and lateral torus. Dorsal hypothalamus and isthmus included high levels of $\alpha$2 AR, whereas pretectum and molecular and proliferative zone of cerebellum were specifically characterized by high densities of $\beta$ AR. From the first year of life, adult levels of both AR were found in most medial telencephalic, hypothalamic, and posterior tegmental areas. Decreases in both receptors densities with age were prominent in ventral and posterior telencephalic, pretectal, ventral thalamic, hypothalamic, and tegmental brain regions. Immunohistochemical data were well correlated with autoradiography and demonstrated the presence of $\alpha$2A, $\alpha$2C, $\beta$1, and $\beta$2 AR subtype-like immunoreactivity. Both the neuronal (perikaryal or dendritic) and the glial localization of receptors was revealed. The localization and age-dependent alterations in $\alpha$2 and $\beta$ AR were parallel to plasticity mechanisms, such as cell proliferation in periventricular thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In addition, the biochemical characteristics, distribution pattern, and neuronal or glial specificity of the receptors in teleost brain support a similar profile of noradrenergic transmission in vertebrate brain evolution. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Using transcription factor-specific Abs derived from the murine system, together with anti-trout Ig Abs and Percoll gradient separation, we analyzed B cells from trout kidney sections and compared them to those from spleen and blood. For this study, immune cells were separated by Percoll gradients, and the resulting subpopulations were defined based on expression of B cell-specific transcription factors Pax-5 and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1, as well as proliferative and Ig-secreting properties. Comparison of kidney, blood, and spleen B cell subsets suggest that 1) the anterior kidney contains mostly proliferating B cell precursors and plasma cells; 2) posterior kidney houses significant populations of (partially) activated B cells and plasmablasts; and 3) trout blood contains resting, non-Ig-secreting cells and lacks plasma cells. After LPS induction of resting B cells in vitro, the kidney and spleen have a high capacity for the generation of plasma cells, whereas the blood has virtually none. Our results indicate that trout B cell subsets are profoundly different among blood, anterior kidney, posterior kidney, and spleen. We hypothesize that developing B cells mature in the anterior side of the kidney and then migrate to sites of activation, either the spleen or the posterior kidney. Lastly, our data support the notion that the trout kidney is a complex, multifunctional immune organ with the potential to support both hemopoiesis as well as humoral immune activation.},
