abstract = {An increasing number of states and municipalities are choosing to reduce plastic litter by replacing plastic items, particularly single-use ones, with same-use products manufactured from compostable plastics. This study investigated the formation and persistence of compostable film microplastic particles (CFMPs) from ultra-thin compostable carrier bags in soil under laboratory conditions, and the potential impact of CFMPs on Aspergillus flavus populations in the soil. During a 12-month incubation period, compostable film samples in soils with small, medium or large populations of indigenous A. flavus, underwent 5.9, 9.8, and 17.1% reduction in total surface area, respectively. Despite the low levels of deterioration, the number of CFMPs released increased steadily over the incubation period, particularly fragments with size < 0.05 mm. Up to 88.4% of the released fragments had associated A. flavus and up to 68% of isolates from CFMPs produced aflatoxins. A. flavus levels associated with CFMPs increased rapidly during the initial part of the 12-month incubation period, whereas the percent aflatoxigenicity continued to increase even after A. flavus density leveled off later. During 12 months incubation, A. flavus DNA amounts recovered from CFMPs increased in soils with all levels of indigenous A. flavus, with the largest increases (119.1%) occurring in soil containing the lowest indigenous A. flavus. These results suggest that burying compostable film in soil, or application of compost containing CFMPs, may reduce soil quality and increase risk of adverse impacts from elevated aflatoxigenic A. flavus populations in soil.},

abstract = {Lead (Pb) is considered an important environmental contaminant due to its considerable toxicity to living organisms. It can enter and accumulate in plant tissues and become part of the food chain. In the present study, individual and combined effects of Bacillus sp. MN-54 and phosphorus (P) on maize growth and physiology were evaluated in Pb-contaminated soil. A pristine soil was artificially contaminated with two levels of Pb (i.e., 250 and 500 mg kg−1 dry soil) and was transferred to plastic pots. Bacillus sp. MN-54 treated and untreated maize (DK-6714) seeds were planted in pots. Recommended doses of nutrients (N and K) were applied in each pot while P was applied in selective pots. Results showed that Pb stress hampered the maize growth and physiological attributes in a concentration-dependent manner, and significant reductions in seedling emergence, shoot and root lengths, fresh and dry biomasses, leaf area, chlorophyll content, rate of photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance were recorded compared with control. Application of Bacillus sp. MN-54 or P particularly in combination significantly reduced the toxic effects of Pb on maize. At higher Pb level (500 mg kg−1), the combined application effectively reduced Pb uptake up to 42.4% and 50% by shoots, 30.8% and 33.9% by roots, and 18.4% and 26.2% in available Pb content in soil after 45 days and 90 days, respectively compared with that of control. Moreover, the use of Bacillus sp. MN-54 significantly improved the P uptake by maize plants by 44.4% as compared with that of control. Our findings suggest that the combined use of Bacillus sp. MN-54 and P could be effective and helpful in improving plant growth and Pb immobilization in Pb-contaminated soil.},

abstract = {Plastic is a general term used for a wide range of high molecular weight organic polymers obtained mostly from the various hydrocarbon and petroleum derivatives. There is an ever-increasing trend towards the production and consumption of plastics due to their extensive industrial and domestic applications. However, a wide spectrum of these polymers is non-biodegradable with few exceptions. The extensive use of plastics, lack of waste management, and casual community behavior towards their proper disposal pose a significant threat to the environment. This has raised growing concerns among various stakeholders to devise policies and innovative strategies for plastic waste management, use of biodegradable polymers especially in packaging, and educating people for their proper disposal. Current polymer degradation strategies rely on chemical, thermal, photo, and biological procedures. In the presence of proper waste management strategies coupled with industrially controlled biodegradation facilities, the use of biodegradable plastics for some applications such as packaging or health industry is a promising and attractive option for economic, environmental, and health benefits. This review highlights the classification of plastics with special emphasis on biodegradable plastics and their rational use, the identified mechanisms of plastic biodegradation, the microorganisms involved in biodegradation, and the current insights into the research on biodegradable plastics. The review has also identified the research gaps in plastic biodegradation followed by future research directions.},

Degradation rates varied between the polymers and incubation temperatures but PCL showed the fastest degradation rate under all conditions and was completely degraded when buried in compost and incubated at 50 °C after 91 days. Furthermore, PCL strips showed a significant reduction in tensile strength in just 2 weeks when incubated in compost >45 °C. Various fungal strains growing on the polymer surfaces were identified by sequence analysis. Aspergillus fumigatus was most commonly found at 25 °C and 37 °C, while Thermomyces lanuginosus, which was abundant at 50 °C, was associated with PCL degradation.},

abstract = {Plastic polymers with different properties have been developed in the last 150 years to replace materials such as wood, glass and metals across various applications. Nevertheless, the distinct properties which make plastic desirable for our daily use also threaten our planet's sustainability. Plastics are resilient, non-reactive and most importantly, non-biodegradable. Hence, there has been an exponential increase in plastic waste generation, which has since been recognised as a global environmental threat. Plastic wastes have adversely affected life on earth, primarily through their undesirable accumulation in landfills, leaching into the soil, increased greenhouse gas emission, etc. Even more damaging is their impact on the aquatic ecosystems as they cause entanglement, ingestion and intestinal blockage in aquatic animals. Furthermore, plastics, especially in the microplastic form, have also been found to interfere with chemical interaction between marine organisms, to cause intrinsic toxicity by leaching, and by absorbing persistent organic contaminants as well as pathogens. The current methods for eliminating these wastes (incineration, landfilling, and recycling) come at massive costs, are unsustainable, and put more burden on our environment. Thus, recent focus has been placed more on the potential of biological systems to degrade synthetic plastics. In this regard, some insects, bacteria and fungi have been shown to ingest these polymers and convert them into environmentally friendly carbon compounds. Hence, in the light of recent literature, this review emphasises the multifaceted roles played by microorganisms in this process. The current understanding of the roles played by actinomycetes, algae, bacteria, fungi and their enzymes in enhancing the degradation of synthetic plastics are reviewed, with special focus on their modes of action and probable enzymatic mechanisms. Besides, key areas for further exploration, such as the manipulation of microorganisms through molecular cloning, modification of enzymatic characteristics and metabolic pathway design, are also highlighted.},

abstract = {The progressive application of new biodegradable plastics in agriculture calls for improved testing approaches to assure their environmental safety. Full biodegradation (≥90%) prevents accumulation in soil, which is the first tier of testing. The application of specific ecotoxicity tests is the second tier of testing needed to show safety for the soil ecosystem. Soil microbial nitrification is widely used as a bioindicator for evaluating the impact of chemicals on soil but it is not applied for evaluating the impact of biodegradable plastics. In this work the International Standard test for biodegradation of plastics in soil (ISO 17556, 2012) was applied both to measure biodegradation and to prepare soil samples needed for a subsequent nitrification test based on another International Standard (ISO 14238, 2012). The plastic mulch film tested in this work showed full biodegradability and no inhibition of the nitrification potential of the soil in comparison with the controls. The laboratory approach suggested in this Technology Report enables (i) to follow the course of biodegradation, (ii) a strict control of variables and environmental conditions, (iii) the application of very high concentrations of test material (to maximize the possible effects). This testing approach could be taken into consideration in improved testing schemes aimed at defining the biodegradability of plastics in soil.},

The changes along the time of the structural interactions and the dynamomechanical properties of these materials and the influence of the retrogradation phenomenon were also studied. The use of isosorbide as plasticizer instead of glycerol improved the stiffness, the water absorption and the biodegradation rate of thermoplastic starch (TPS). Moreover, no evidence of retrogradation for isosorbide was observed. An isosorbide content of 35% and the addition of MCC filler enhanced in a greater extent these properties with a complete biodegradability in 7 month.

abstract = {Terrestrial nanoplastics (NPs) pose a serious threat to agricultural food production systems due to the potential harm of soil-born micro- and macroorganisms that promote soil fertility and ability of NPs to adsorb onto and penetrate into vegetables and other crops. Very little is known about the dispersion, fate and transport of NPs in soils. This is because of the challenges of analyzing terrestrial NPs by conventional microscopic techniques due to the low concentrations of NPs and absence of optical transparency in these systems. Herein, we investigate the potential utility of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and Ultra SANS (USANS) to probe the agglomeration behavior of NPs prepared from polybutyrate adipate terephthalate, a prominent biodegradable plastic used in agricultural mulching, in the presence of vermiculite, an artificial soil. SANS with the contrast matching technique was used to study the aggregation of NPs co-dispersed with vermiculite in aqueous media. We determined the contrast match point for vermiculite was 66% D2O / 33% H2O. At this condition, the signal for vermiculite was $\sim$50–100%-fold lower that obtained using neat H2O or D2O as solvent. According to SANS and USANS, smaller-sized NPs (50 nm) remained dispersed in water and did not undergo size reduction or self-agglomeration, nor formed agglomerates with vermiculite. Larger-sized NPs (300–1000 nm) formed self-agglomerates and agglomerates with vermiculite, demonstrating their significant adhesion with soil. However, employment of convective transport (simulated by ex situ stirring of the slurries prior to SANS and USANS analyses) reduced the self-agglomeration, demonstrating weak NP-NP interactions. Convective transport also led to size reduction of the larger-sized NPs. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential utility of SANS and USANS with contrast matching technique for investigating behavior of terrestrial NPs in complex soil systems.},

abstract = {Agricultural plastic mulch films provide a favorable soil microclimate for plant growth, improving crop yields. Biodegradable plastic mulch films (BDMs) have emerged as a sustainable alternative to widely used non-biodegradable polyethylene (PE) films. BDMs are tilled into the soil after use and are expected to biodegrade under field conditions. However, little is known about the microbes involved in biodegradation and the relationships between microbes and plastics in soils. In order to capture the consortium of soil microbes associated with (and thus likely degrading) BDMs, agriculturally-weathered plastics from two locations were studied alongside laboratory enrichment experiments to assess differences in the microbial communities associated with BDMs and PE films. Using a combination of amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR), we observed that agriculturally-weathered plastics hosted an enrichment of fungi and an altered bacterial community composition compared to the surrounding soil. Notably, Methylobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas were enriched on BDMs compared to non-biodegradable PE. In laboratory enrichment cultures, microbial consortia were able to degrade the plastics, and the composition of the microbial communities was influenced by the composition of the BDMs. Our initial characterization of the microbial communities associated with biodegradable plastic mulch films, or the biodegradable “plastisphere,” lays the groundwork for understanding biodegradation dynamics of biodegradable plastics in the environment.},

Soil ecosystems, particularly agricultural land, have been recognized as a major sink of microplastics, but the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems (e.g., above and below ground) remain largely unknown. In this study, different types of microplastics [biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA)], conventional high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and microplastic clothing fibers were added to soil containing the endogeic Aporrectodea rosea (rosy-tipped earthworm) and planted with Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) to assess the biophysical soil response in a mesocosm experiment. When exposed to fibers or PLA microplastics, fewer seeds germinated. There was also a reduction in shoot height with PLA. The biomass of A. rosea exposed to HDPE was significantly reduced compared to control samples. Furthermore, with HDPE present there was a decrease in soil pH. The size distribution of water-stable soil aggregates was altered when microplastics were present, suggesting potential alterations of soil stability. This study provides evidence that microplastics manufactured of HDPE and PLA, and synthetic fibers can affect the development of L. perenne, health of A. rosea and basic, but crucial soil properties, with potential further impacts on soil ecosystem functioning.},

Although these testing methods have been developed for plastics, it has been shown in project KBBPPS that they can be extended also to lubricants with small modifications. Reproducibility is a critical issue regarding biodegradation tests in the laboratory. Among the main testing variables are the soil types and nutrients available (mainly nitrogen). For this reason, the effect of the soil type on the biodegradation rates of various bio-based materials (cellulose and lubricants) was tested for five different natural soil types (loam, loamy sand, clay, clay-loam, and silt-loam organic). It was shown that use of samples containing 1 g of C in a substrate of 300 g of soil with the addition of 0.1 g of N as nutrient strongly improves the reproducibility of the test making the results practically independent of the soil type with the exception of the organic soil. The sandy soil was found to need addition of higher amount of nutrients to exhibit similar biodegradation rates as those achieved with the other soil types. Therefore, natural soils can be used for Standard biodegradation tests of bio-based materials yielding reproducible results with the addition of appropriate nutrients.},

In this study, the bacterial taxon and functional composition of soil microplastic-attached communities at Guiyu, a notorious e-waste dismantling area in Guangdong Province, China, were investigated by means of high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed that fundamental difference in bacterial communities existed among microplastics selected from three plots with different dismantling methods and their surroundings, suggesting that microplastic surface created a new ecological niche in soil environment, and the bacteria adapted well to the surface-related lifestyle. The formation of microplastic-attached bacteria depended not only on various dismantled plastic materials, but also on disassembly methods that caused different soil physicochemical characters which might also influence the bacterial communities. As the hydrocarbon degraders, the family Hyphomonadaceae were also found on soil microplastic, further confirming that microorganisms played a role in biodegrading microplastic in e-waste zone. The analysis of functional profiles speculated that microplastic-attached bacteria had the potential to degrade pollutants. This study provides a new perspective for exploring microplastic-associated bacteria and increasing our understanding of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.},

Based on high throughput sequencing, enzymatic activity assay and dynamic analysis of soil carbon and nitrogen, we investigated the effects of biodegradable polylactic acid microplastics (PLA MPs) on soil microbiota and related ecological processes under conditions of high or low carbon content. The results showed that PLA MPs had no significant effect on the overall diversity and composition of bacterial communities or related ecosystem functions and processes. However, co-occurrence network analysis revealed that PLA MPs impacted the interactions between constituent species, which might have legacy effect on soil bacterial communities and functions.

In this work, a simultaneous sorption and biodegradation technique was used to remove 16 PAHs from a soil washing solution (SWS) obtained by rinsing a heavily contaminated soil from a coking plant with Triton X-100 (TX-100). This was done by immobilizing a pyrene-degrading bacterial strain in polyvinyl alcohol-sodium alginate (PVA-SA) hydrogel beads. Removal performance of free bacteria, blank PVA-SA beads and beads with immobilized degrading bacteria at a low, medium and high initial concentration was evaluated. The recycling and removal performance of the used beads were also examined. Our findings showed that hydrogel beads with immobilized bacteria at a medium concentration can remove around 77% ∑16PAHs from SWS in 96 h.

The bacteria-immobilized beads are more efficient and sustainable than free bacteria and blank beads due to simultaneous sorption and biodegradation processes, thus providing a solid reference for possible industrial application of bacteria immobilization technique to deal with SWSs with complex composition.},

abstract = {Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is widely used as plasticizer and has been detected in the environment, posing a threat to animal health. However, the effects of DBP on agricultural microbiomes are not known. In this study, DBP levels in black soil were evaluated, and the impact of DBP contamination on the uptake and metabolism of sugars in microbes was assessed by glucose absorption tests, metaproteomics, metabolomics, enzyme activity assays and computational simulation analysis. The results indicated that DBP contamination accelerated glucose consumption and upregulated the expression of porins and periplasmic monosaccharide ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter solute-binding proteins (SBPs). DBP and its metabolic intermediates (carboxymuconate and butanol) may form a stable complex with sugar transporters and enhance the rigidity and stability of these proteins. Sugar metabolism resulting in the generation of ATP and reducing agent (NADPH), as well as the expression of some key enzymes (dehydrogenases) were also upregulated by DBP treatment. Moreover, a diverse bacterial community appears to utilize sugar, suggesting that there are widespread effects of DBP contamination on soil microbial ecosystems. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for investigating the toxicological effects of DBP on microbes in black soil.},

In this study, earthworms Metaphire guillelmi were exposed to soil amended with 0.25% (w/w) high-density polyethylene (HDPE, 25 $\mu$m) or polypropylene (PP, 13 $\mu$m) microplastics for 28 d. The ingestion of HDPE and PP microplastics by M. guillelmi was clearly demonstrated by Nile Red fluorescence staining method. There were significant differences for the microbiota between the M. guillelmi gut and the surrounding soil, which may result from the influence of specific conditions in the gut habitat. HDPE and PP microplastics exposure did not induce gut microbiota dysbiosis in M. guillelmi. However, PP microplastics exposure significantly reduced bacterial diversity and altered bacterial community structure in the soil. Specifically, the relative abundance of Aeromonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae significantly increased while the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and two unidentified families affiliated with Proteobacteria significantly decreased. This study broadens our understanding of the ecotoxicity of microplastics on the soil and gut microbiota of terrestrial organisms.},

abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A is an important organic chemical as an intermediate, final and inert ingredient in manufacturing of many important products like polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, flame retardants, food-drink packaging coating, and other. BPA is an endocrine disruptor compound that mimics the function of estrogen causing damage to reproductive organs. Bacterial degradation has been consider as a cost effective and eco-friendly method for BPA degradation compared with physical and chemical methods. This study aimed to isolate and identify bacterial strain capable to degrade and tolerate high concentrations of this pollutant, studying the factors affecting the degradation process and study the degradation mechanism of this strain. Results: YC-AE1 is a Gram negative bacterial strain isolated from soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida by 16S rRNA gene sequence and BIOLOG identification system. This strain found to have a high capacity to degrade the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A (BPA). Response surface methodology using central composite design was used to statistically optimize the environmental factors during BPA degradation and the results obtained by significant model were 7.2, 30 °C and 2.5% for optimum initial pH, temperature and inoculum size, respectively. Prolonged incubation period with low NaCl concentration improve the biodegradation of BPA. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high coefficient of determination, R 2 and Adj-R 2 which were 0.9979 and 0.9935, respectively. Substrate analysis found that, strain YC-AE1 could degrade a wide variety of bisphenol A-related pollutants such as bisphenol B, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, Dibutyl phthalate, Diethylhexyl phthalate and Diethyl phthalate in varying proportion. Pseudomonas putida YC-AE1 showed high ability to degrade a wide range of BPA concentrations (0.5-1000 mg l-1) with completely degradation for 500 mg l-1 within 72 h. Metabolic intermediates detected in this study by HPLC-MS were identified as 4,4-dihydroxy-alpha-methylstilbene, p-hydroxybenzaldeyde, p-hydroxyacetophenone, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenacyl alcohol, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate. Conclusions: This study reports Pseudomonas putida YC-AE1 as BPA biodegrader with high performance in degradation and tolerance to high BPA concentration. It exhibited strong degradation capacity and prominent adaptability towards a wide range of environmental conditions. Moreover, it degrades BPA in a short time via two different degradation pathways.},

abstract = {In this study, two strains of Aspergillus sp. and Lysinibacillus sp. with remarkable abilities to degrade low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were isolated from landfill soils in Tehran using enrichment culture and screening procedures. The biodegradation process was performed for 126 days in soil using UV- and non-UV-irradiated pure LDPE films without pro-oxidant additives in the presence and absence of mixed cultures of selected microorganisms. The process was monitored by measuring the microbial population, the biomass carbon, pH and respiration in the soil, and the mechanical properties of the films. The carbon dioxide measurements in the soil showed that the biodegradation in the un-inoculated treatments were slow and were about 7.6% and 8.6% of the mineralisation measured for the non-UV-irradiated and UV-irradiated LDPE, respectively, after 126 days. In contrast, in the presence of the selected microorganisms, biodegradation was much more efficient and the percentages of biodegradation were 29.5% and 15.8% for the UV-irradiated and non-UV-irradiated films, respectively. The percentage decrease in the carbonyl index was higher for the UV-irradiated LDPE when the biodegradation was performed in soil inoculated with the selected microorganisms. The percentage elongation of the films decreased during the biodegradation process. The Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine structural, morphological and surface changes on polyethylene. These analyses showed that the selected microorganisms could modify and colonise both types of polyethylene. This study also confirmed the ability of these isolates to utilise virgin polyethylene without pro-oxidant additives and oxidation pretreatment, as the carbon source. {\textcopyright} 2013 Esmaeili et al.},

However very few studies concentrated on the effects of MPs exposure on soil microbial community. The alterations of enzymatic activities and bacterial communities were assayed by spiking 1% and 5% (w/w) of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs in an acid soil. The results showed that both PE and PVC addition inhibited fluorescein diacetate hydrolase activity and stimulated urease and acid phosphatase activities, and declined the richness and diversity of the bacterial communities. More severe effects were observed in the PE treated soils compared to the PVC treated soils generally. The relative abundances of families Burkholderiaceae increased significantly (p < .05) after MPs addition, suggesting the bacteria associated with nitrogen fixation stimulated by the MPs input. Meanwhile, significant (p < .05) decline of Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthobacteraceae after addition of 5% PVC and 1% PE MPs, respectively implied that MPs might inhibit the biodegradation of xenobiotics in the soil. Mover, the PICRUSt analysis demonstrated that membrane transporter was a sensitive prediction functional gene of microplastics exposure in the soil. Future studies could be focused on the role of MPs on the regulation of nitrogen cycling and organic compounds degradation in soils.},

abstract = {Phthalate esters are one of the most frequently detected persistent organic pollutants in the environment. A better understanding of their occurrence and degradation in the environment and during wastewater treatment processes will facilitate the development of strategies to reduce these pollutants and to bioremediate contaminated freshwater and soil. Phthalate esters occur at measurable levels in different environments worldwide. For example, the concentrations of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) in atmospheric particulate matter, fresh water and sediments, soil, and landfills are N.D.-10.4ng/m3, N.D.-31.7$\mu$g/L, N.D.-316$\mu$g/kg dry weight, and N.D.-200$\mu$g/kg dry weight, N.D.-43.27$\mu$g/L, respectively. Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) are primary phthalate ester pollutants. Urbanization has increased the discharge of phthalate esters to atmospheric and aquatic environments, and the use of agricultural plastics has exacerbated soil contamination by phthalate esters in rural areas. Aerobic biodegradation is the primary manner of phthalate ester mineralization in the environment, and this process has been widely studied. Phthalate esters can be removed during wastewater treatment processes. The combination of different wastewater treatment technologies showed greater efficiency in the removal of phthalate esters than individual treatment steps, such as the combination of anaerobic wastewater treatment with a membrane bioreactor would increase the efficiency of phthalate ester removal from 65%-71% to 95%-97%. This review provides a useful framework to identify future research objectives to achieve the mineralization and elimination of phthalate esters in the environment.},

The content of DBP in wheat grown on all soil types increased with increasing DBP stress concentration, and the DBP content of each tissue decreased as wheat growth progressed. Under the same conditions, the DBP content of roots exceeded that of leaves and stems, and the DBP content of all tissues decreased in the order of brown soil > fluvo-aquic soil > cinnamon soil. The decrease of DBP content with growth and the content of mono-n-butyl dicarboxylate (MBP, main metabolite of DBP) followed the order of cinnamon soil > fluvo-aquic soil > brown soil; the latter parameter initially increased and then decreased as growth progressed. The changes in P450 content and GST activities in wheat tissues were highly consistent with the corresponding changes in DBP and MBP content, except for the DBP stress level of 40 mg kg−1 at the seedling stage. Based on the obtained results, it was speculated that P450 and GST were strongly involved in the metabolism of DBP in wheat: oxygen atoms were inserted into the aldehyde C–H bond of the species generated after hydrolysis of ester groups under the action of P450 to achieve hydrocarbon hydroxylation under mild conditions and generate MBP.},

abstract = {Plastic biodegradable mulch (plastic BDM) is tilled after use, but there is concern about incomplete degradation and potential impact on subsequent crops, and we lack a reliable method to measure mulch degradation post soil-incorporation. We conducted two field experiments to (i) develop a sampling method to estimate the amount of mulch (fragments size >2.36 mm) in the field post soil-incorporation, and (ii) assess the amount of BDM in the soil after four consecutive years of mulch incorporation. In Expt. 1, we used the quartering method to reduce soil from a 1 m2 field sample area to a representative 19 L sample. In Expt. 2, we applied and tilled four plastic BDMs: BioAgri, Naturecycle, Organix AG, and an experimental mulch; and one paper mulch, WeedGuardPlus, in their respective plots for four consecutive years. Starting in year 2, we sampled soil with the quartering method each spring and fall to determine mulch recovery. With respect to the total amount of mulch applied, average mulch recovery in the fall for the three commercial plastic BDMs was 71%, 50%, and 35% after second, third and fourth applications, respectively. For the experimental mulch, the average recovery was 80%, 69%, and 54% in the fall after second, third, and fourth applications, respectively. Recovery was slightly lower in spring than in preceding fall all years. For WeedGuardPlus, average recovery was 14%–20% in each fall, and no recovery in any spring (complete degradation). The results show that the quartering method reliably estimates the amount of mulch in a field and BDMs degrade over time in the field even with repeated applications, but complete degradation takes >1 year. While a few standards (e.g., ASTM D5988) specify how to determine biodegradation of plastics in soil under controlled laboratory conditions, our sampling method assesses plastic degradation under diverse field conditions.},

abstract = {Effects of agricultural practices on ecosystem carbon storage have acquired widespread concern due to its alleviation of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Recently, combining of furrow-ridge with plastic film mulching in spring maize ecosystem was widely applied to boost crop water productivity in the semiarid regions of China. However, there is still limited information about the potentials for increased ecosystem carbon storage of this tillage method. The objective of this study was to quantify and contrast net carbon dioxide exchange, biomass accumulation and carbon budgets of maize (Zea maize L.) fields under the traditional non-mulching with flat tillage (CK) and partial plastic film mulching with furrow-ridge tillage (MFR) on the China Loess Plateau. Half-hourly net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of both treatments were synchronously measured with two eddy covariance systems during the growing seasons of 2011 through 2013. At same time green leaf area index (GLAI) and biomass were also measured biweekly. Compared with CK, the warmer and wetter (+1.3°C and +4.3%) top soil at MFR accelerated the rates of biomass accumulation, promoted greater green leaf area and thus shortened the growing seasons by an average value of 10.4 days for three years. MFR stimulated assimilation more than respiration during whole growing season, resulting in a higher carbon sequestration in terms of NEE of -79 gC/m2 than CK. However, after considering carbon in harvested grain (or aboveground biomass), there is a slight higher carbon sink (or a stronger carbon source) in MFR due to its greater difference of aboveground biomass than that of grain between both treatments. These results demonstrate that partial plastic film mulched furrow-ridge tillage with aboveground biomass exclusive of grain returned to the soil is an effective way to enhance simultaneously carbon sequestration and grain yield of maize in the semiarid regions.},

In this study, the feasibility of simultaneous remediation of soil As(III) and a PAE, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), by a manganese-oxidizing bacterium (MnOB) was evaluated. As immobilization and DBP degradation were simultaneously enhanced by MnOB addition. The effects of initial concentrations of As(III), DBP, and Mn(II), and moisture content on the removal of As(III) and DBP were investigated. The results indicated that there was a competitive interaction between As(III) and DBP removal, and 40 mg/kg of Mn(II) dosage and 20%–30% soil moisture content were recommended for optimal and simultaneous removal of As(III) and DBP. Microbial community analysis revealed that community structure and diversity were not changed significantly by MnOB addition. Taken together, the findings from this study indicated that DBP was degraded primarily by microorganisms, whereas As(III) was removed largely by biogenic Mn oxides and immobilized by adsorption onto Mg/Fe oxides and/or formation of metal arsenate precipitates/co-precipitates. This study offers a novel and high-efficiency strategy to remediate the combined contamination of As and PAEs in soils.},

abstract = {Plastic-film mulching has played an important role to promote agricultural production in arid areas; however, due to its inefficient recycling capacity, large amounts of residues have been accumulated in soils, causing negative impacts on crop growth and on the environment. To investigate these effects on water use efficiency, a two-years field experiment was carried out, applying different levels of plastic-film residues, from 0 to 600 kg ha−1. Results show that these residues have a negative impact on root and shoot growth at several growth stages of corn crop, particularly if above 300 kg ha−1. Root length and weight density decrease with the amount of residues throughout the majority of crop season. Plastic-film residues of about 600 kg ha−1 are responsible for the decrease of the biomass root to shoot ratio during the tasseling stage. Moreover, during physiological maturity, root and shoot revealed the highest sensitivity, and the least negative effects on the root system. Results also show that crop water consumption has a slight decrease with the plastic-film residues, though there was also a significant decrease of the yield and the water use efficiency reduction. This information allows to state that it is determinant to learn how to deal with the problem, adjusting the irrigation and crop management to avoid yield impacts. It would also be important to find an efficient procedure to mechanically collect the residues in the soil, and to apply new biodegradable film mulching.},

HBCDs have been found to cause developmental and reproductive toxicity; it is important to investigate the occurrence and metabolization of HBCDs in the soil environments with plastic waste contamination. This work analyzed HBCDs and their metabolites in soil and plant samples collected from Xinle and Dingzhou—the major plastic waste recycling centers in North China. Results showed that total HBCD concentrations in soils followed the order: plastic waste treatment site (11.0–624 ng/g) > roadside (2.96–85.4 ng/g) ≥ farmland (8.69–55.5 ng/g). HBCDs were detected in all the plant samples with total concentrations ranging from 3.47 to 23.4 ng/g. $\gamma$-HBCD was the dominant congener in soils, while $\alpha$-HBCD was preferentially accumulated in plants. Compositions of HBCD isomers in soils and plants were significantly different (P < 0.05) among sampling sites and among plant species. HBCDs in farmland soil and all plant samples exhibited high enantio-selectivity based on the enantiomeric fractions (EFs). Furthermore, metabolites of pentabromocyclododecenes (PBCDEs) were frequently identified in soils, and mono-OH-HBCDs were the most common ones in plants. This study for the first time provides evidences of HBCD contamination in the soil-plant system caused by plastic waste, their stereo-selectivity, and metabolization behavior, improving our understanding of the environmental behavior and fate of HBCDs.},

Notwithstanding, the potential effects on soil ecosystems remain largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of polyethylene microplastics on soil enzymatic activities and the bacterial community were evaluated, and the microbiota colonizing on microplastics were also investigated. Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per kg soil) significantly increased the urease and catalase activities in soil after 15 days, and no discernible alteration of invertase activities was detected. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversities (richness, evenness, and diversity) of the microbiota in soil were not obviously changed by the PE amendment, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on plastic fragments were significantly lower than those in the control and amended soils. Different taxonomic composition was observed in between the control and amended soils after 90 days of incubation. Bacterial assemblages with distinct community structure colonized the PE microplastics. Additionally, several taxa including plastic-degrading bacteria and pathogens were more abundant on microplastics. Simultaneously, the predicted functional profiles showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were higher on the microplastics. These results indicated that microplastics in soil, compared with those in aquatic environments, can also act as a distinct microbial habitat, potentially altering the ecological functions of soil ecosystems.},

abstract = {Micro- and nano-plastics have widely been recognized as major global environmental problem due to its widespread use and inadequate waste management. The emergence of these plastic pollutants in agroecosystem is a legitimate ecotoxicological concerns for food web exchanges. In agriculture, micro/nano plastics are originated from a variety of different agricultural management practices, such as the use of compost, sewage sludge and mulching. A range of soil properties and plant traits are affected by their presence. With the increase of plastic debris, these pollutant materials have now begun to demonstrate serious implications for key soil ecosystem functions, such as soil microbial activity and nutrient cycling. Nitrogen (N) cycle is key predictor of ecological stability and management in terrestrial ecosystem. In this review, we evaluate ecological risks associated with micro-nano plastic for soil-plant system. We also discuss the consequence of plastic pollutants, either positive or negative, on soil microbial activities. In addition, we systematically summarize both direct and hypothesized implications for N cycling in agroecosystem. We conclude that soil N transformation had showed varied effects resulting from different types and sizes of plastic polymers present in soil. While mixed effects of microplastic pollution on plant growth and yield have been observed, biodegradable plastics have appeared to pose greater risk for plant growth compared to chemical plastic polymers.},

The metabolic versatility of P. putida makes this organism attractive for biotechnological applications such as biodegradation of environmental pollutants and synthesis of added-value chemicals (biocatalysis). This organism has been extensively studied in respect to various stress responses, mechanisms of genetic plasticity and transcriptional regulation of catabolic genes. P. putida is able to colonize the surface of living organisms, but is generally considered to be of low virulence. A number of P. putida strains are able to promote plant growth. The aim of this review is to give historical overview of the discovery of the species P. putida and isolation and characterization of P. putida strains displaying potential for biotechnological applications. This review also discusses some major findings in P. putida research encompassing regulation of catabolic operons, stress-tolerance mechanisms and mechanisms affecting evolvability of bacteria under conditions of environmental stress.},

abstract = {Plastic residues have become a serious environmental problem in areas where agricultural plastic film are used intensively. Although numerous of studies have been done to assess its impacts on soil quality and crop yields, the understanding of meso-plastic particles effects on plant is still limited. In this study, low density polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable plastic (Bio) mulch film were selected to study the effects of meso-plastic debris on soybean germination and plant growth with the accumulation levels of 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% in soil (w: w, size ranging 0.5–2 cm) by a pot experiment under field condition. Results showed that the germination viability of soybean seeds was reduced to 82.39%, 39.44% and 26.06% in the treatments with 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% added plastic debris compared to the control (CK), respectively, suggesting that plastic residues in soil inhibit the viability of soybean seed germination. The plastic debris had a significant negative effect on plant height and culm diameter during the entire growth stage of soybean. Similarly, the leaf area at harvest was reduced by 1.97%, 6.86% and 11.53% compared to the CK in the treatments with 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% plastic debris addition, respectively. In addition, the total plant biomass under plastic addition was reduced in both the flowering and harvesting stages, compared to the CK. For the different type of plastic residues, plant height, leaf area and root/shoot ratio at group PE were significantly lower than those of groups treated by Bio. In conclusion, PE debris had a greater negative effects on plant height, culm diameter, leaf area and root/shoot ratio while Bio debris mainly showed the adverse effects on germination viability and root biomass especially at the flowering stage. Therefore, further research is required to elaborate plastic particles' effects on different stages of crops and soil quality.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas sp. isolated from soil, are bioremediating microorganisms that are capable of degrading various types of plastics. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) has the most excellent structural stability among general plastics and thus is extremely difficult to break down using physical or chemical methods. This study demonstrates the efficient biodegradation of PPS by Pseudomonas sp., which exists in the gut of superworms. Compared with the conventional film-type of plastic, the degradation efficiencies to the bead form of plastic were significantly improved and thus the biodegradation time was dramatically shortened. Therefore, instead of film-type plastics, we used 300 $\mu$m diameter plastic beads for the measurement of Pseudomonas sp.-mediated biodegradation of PPS during a 10-day period. This method not only can be used for comparison and verification of the biodegradation efficiency of different types of plastics within a short reaction time of 10 days, but also provides the possibility to develop a new and more efficient screening system to rapidly identify the most efficient species of bacteria for the biodegradation of various types of plastics.},

The results showed that DEHP at concentration of 500 mg/L in a mineral salt medium containing 1.0% yeast extract can be almost completely degraded (98.05%) by strain B1213. The optimal condition for DEHP degradation was pH 7.0, temperature 30 °C. Moreover, B1213 shows better degradation effect on long-chain PAEs, such as DEHP, which provides a great potential for its use in bioremediation of soils contaminated with PAEs. The kinetic studies showed that DEHP depletion curves fit well to the modified Gompertz model. The mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-dibutyl phthalate (MBP), phthalic acid (PA) and 4-oxo-hexanoic acid were identified as the metabolites of DEHP by HPLC-ESI-QTOFMS. The detection of MBP and 4-oxo-hexanoic acid as intermediates prompted us to propose a novel and more complete DEHP biodegradation pathway compared to the classic pathway: DEHP is first degraded to MEHP by esterases, which is then converted to MBP through $\beta$-oxidation. Then MBP is degraded to PA by esterases, which is then converted to protocatechuate (PCA) under aerobic conditions rapidly. PCA is ultimately cleaved to generate CO2 and H2O via 4-oxo-hexanoic acid.},

abstract = {Microplastic pollution is a major global environmental problem in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Pesticides are frequently applied to agricultural soil to reduce the effects of pests on crops, but may also affect the degradation of plastics. In this study, we generated microplastics from polyethylene (PE) film and biodegradable poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) film and determined (1) the effect of prothioconazole on degradation of the microplastics, and (2) the adsorption and release characteristics of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, As, Pb, Ba, and Sn) by the microplastics during degradation process. Changes of surface functional groups and morphologies were measured by FTIR and SEM, while metal concentrations were determined by ICPMS. Prothioconazole was found to promote plastic degradation. PBAT degraded faster and adsorbed more heavy metals from the soil than PE. Whether the microplastics adsorb or release heavy metals depended on the metal and their concentrations. Prothioconazole inhibited the adsorption of Cr, As, Pb and Ba by microplastics, promoted the adsorption of Cu, and had no significant effect for Sn. These results can help to assess the ecological risk of microplastic pollution from plastic mulch when combined with heavy metals.},

Treatments established were: (1) no mulching with urea, (2) no mulching with controlled release fertiliser (CRF), (3) transparent plastic-film mulching (PMt) with urea, (4) PMt with CRF, (5) black plastic-film mulching (PMb) with urea, and (6) PMb with CRF. During the early growth stages, soil CO2 emissions were noted as PMt > PMb > no mulching, and this order was reversed in the late growth stages. This trend was the result of topsoil temperature dynamics. There were no significant correlations noted between soil CO2 emissions and soil temperature and moisture. Cumulative soil CO2 emissions were higher for the PMt than for the PMb, and grain yield was higher for the PMb treatments than for the PMt or no mulching treatments. The CRF produced higher grain yield and inhibited soil CO2 emissions. Soil CO2 emissions per unit grain yield were lower for the BC treatment than for the other treatments. In conclusion, the use of black plastic-film mulching and controlled release fertiliser not only increased maize yield, but also reduced soil CO2 emissions.},

The aim of this study is to determine the remediation efficiency of GWC on the Pb concentration in soil and uptake by pakchoi cabbage and to assess the activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase after applying GWC. Original soil samples were spiked with Pb (NO3)2 of 500 mg/kg, and greenhouse pot experiment was carried out. Three seedlings of pakchoi cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp) were planted in plastic pots with mixture of soil amended with three levels of GWC (2%, 5%, and 10%, w/w). Soil and plant samples were collected over 45-day growth, after which Pb concentration and enzyme activities were assessed by laboratory analysis. The available Pb in soil and total Pb in roots and leaves of pakchoi cabbage greatly decreased after adding GWC, associated with significant increases in organic matter, water soluble organic carbon, total nitrogen, and available K and P, whereas pH was not a main factor controlling Pb speciation in this study. Activities of dehydrogenase, urease, and catalase were promoted with addition of GWC because physical properties, high organic matter, and organic carbon content rose by 9-fold, 40%, and 37% at 10% application rate, respectively. In conclusion, GWC could be an alternative option for the remediation of Pb-contaminated soil because of soil quality improvement and Pb reduction in soils and plants, without introducing extra heavy metals compared with other organic amendments.},

abstract = {Polyacrylamide (PAM) has been used extensively due to its well-known stable chemical properties, but limited information is available on the biodegradation of soil-containing PAM. In this work, sufficient degradation of PAM was achieved via the addition of the Klebsiella sp. PCX-biochar composite to PAM-containing soil, due to the synergic effect of bio-augmentation and bio-stimulation. The optimal degradation rate of 69.1% over 30-day period was observed under the following conditions: the addition of immobilized bacteria at 0.07 g/g, pH 6.6, and temperature at 38.0 °C. In this study, we showed that PAM was successfully hydrolyzed by amidase, and ammonia in the hydrolysis product was then oxidized by the nitrifying bacteria. The decrease of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) also demonstrated the chain cleavage in PAM. PAM was utilized as a carbon source not only by Klebsiella sp. PCX but also by some taxa from indigenous bacteria. Last but not least, it was shown in this study that biochar, even though immobilized with exogenous microorganisms, actually enhanced bacterial diversity and stimulated the growth of some indigenous PAM-degrading taxa. Based on the above observations, we concluded that PAM biodegradation via the addition of bacteria-immobilized biochar was a synergy of both bio-augmentation and bio-stimulation strategies.},

These materials were exposed in three natural environments; open-air, buried in soil, and submersed in seawater, as well as in controlled laboratory conditions. In the marine environment, the compostable bag completely disappeared within 3 months. However, the same compostable bag type was still present in the soil environment after 27 months but could no longer hold weight without tearing. After 9 months exposure in the open-air, all bag materials had disintegrated into fragments. Collectively, our results showed that none of the bags could be relied upon to show any substantial deterioration over a 3 year period in all of the environments. It is therefore not clear that the oxo-biodegradable or biodegradable formulations provide sufficiently advanced rates of deterioration to be advantageous in the context of reducing marine litter, compared to conventional bags.},

Biodegradation was monitored by mass decrease, and the highest degradation rate was achieved in soil for cactus growing (81.30 %). Statistical analysis proved that microorganisms in different soil samples have different ability of biodegradation, and there is a significant negative correlation between the share of polystyrene in copolymer and degree of biodegradation. Grafting of polystyrene on starch on one hand prevents complete degradation of starch that is present (with maximal percentage of degraded starch ranging from 55 to 93 %), while on the other hand there is an upper limit of share of polystyrene in the copolymer (ranging from 37 to 77 %) that is preventing biodegradation of degradable part of copolymers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Resource partitioning may facilitate coexistence, as co-occurring species use different sources of the same limiting resource3,4. In plant communities, however, direct evidence for partitioning of the commonly limiting nutrient, phosphorus (P), has remained scarce due to the challenges of quantifying P acquisition from its different chemical forms present in soil5. To address this, we used 33P to directly trace P uptake from DNA, orthophosphate and calcium phosphate into monocultures and mixed communities of plants growing in grassland soil. We show that co-occurring plants acquire P from these important organic and mineral sources in different proportions, and that differences in P source use are consistent with the species' root adaptations for P acquisition. Furthermore, the net benefit arising from niche plasticity (the gain in P uptake for a species in a mixed community compared to monoculture) correlates with species abundance in the wild, suggesting that niche plasticity for P is a driver of community structure. This evidence for P resource partitioning and niche plasticity may explain the high levels of biodiversity frequently found in P-limited ecosystems worldwide6,7.},

The results showed that macro- and micro- plastic residues affected both above-ground and below-ground parts of the wheat plant during both vegetative and reproductive growth. The type of plastic mulch films used had a strong effect on wheat growth with the biodegradable plastic mulch showing stronger negative effects as compared to polyethylene. The presence of earthworms had an overall positive effect on the wheat growth and chiefly alleviated the impairments made by plastic residues.},

abstract = {Adding exogenous low-molecular weight organic acids is an effective technique to improve phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated soil and has been well documented, but how acid application rate affects remediation efficiency and its underlying limiting factors remains elusive. We investigated this using pot experiments with rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) as the model plant. Plastic pots packed with a sandy loam contaminated by Cd at 4.838 mg/kg were amended with acetic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, malic acid and tartaric acid, respectively, at an application rate gradient varying from 0.0 to 12.0 mmol/kg. Plants in each pot were harvested after growing for five months, and we then measured the exchangeable, carbonate, Fe–Mn oxide, organic and residual Cd in the rhizosphere, as well as Cd in both roots and shoots. The results showed that all organic acids improved plant uptake of Cd and, compared with the control without acid addition, they could improve Cd uptake by more than 100%. The enhanced Cd extraction was due to the increase in exchangeable Cd in the rhizosphere. Plant Cd was weakly correlated to the amount of Cd lost from a unit volume of the rhizosphere due to root extraction (R2 = 0.06), but a good negative correlation was found between them after normalizing the lost Cd by root biomass (R2 = 0.36). Mass balance analysis revealed that the average Cd content in soil (rhizosphere and bulk soils combined) was much higher than the Cd content in the rhizosphere, and the improved Cd mobility after acid addition was thus due to the increased chelation. As diffusion of ligands in water is one order in magnitude smaller than diffusion of Cd ions, our results suggested that Cd migration from the bulk soil into the rhizosphere was a major factor limiting Cd phytoextraction by rapeseed after adding the exogenous organic acids.},

abstract = {Global crop yields are limited by water and nutrient availability. Soil mulching (with plastic or straw) reduces evaporation, modifies soil temperature and thereby affects crop yields. Reported effects of mulching are sometimes contradictory, likely due to differences in climatic conditions, soil characteristics, crop species, and also water and nitrogen (N) input levels. Here we report on a meta-analysis of the effects of mulching on wheat and maize, using 1310 yield observations from 74 studies conducted in 19 countries. Our results indicate that mulching significantly increased yields, WUE (yield per unit water) and NUE (yield per unit N) by up to 60%, compared with no-mulching. Effects were larger for maize than wheat, and larger for plastic mulching than straw mulching. Interestingly, plastic mulching performed better at relatively low temperature while straw mulching showed the opposite trend. Effects of mulching also tended to decrease with increasing water input. Mulching effects were not related to soil organic matter content. In conclusion, soil mulching can significantly increase maize and wheat yields, WUE and NUE, and thereby may contribute to closing the yield gap between attainable and actual yields, especially in dryland and low nutrient input agriculture. The management of soil mulching requires site-specific knowledge.},

abstract = {Phthalate esters have raised public concerns owing to their effects on the environment and human health. We identified a novel phthalate-degrading hydrolase, EstJ6, from a metagenomic library using function-driven screening. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that EstJ6 is a member of family IV esterases. EstJ6 hydrolyzed various dialkyl and monoalkyl phthalate esters, and exhibited high hydrolytic activity (128 U/mg) toward dibutyl phthalate at 40 °C and pH 7.5. EstJ6 hydrolyzed not only common phthalate esters with simple side chains but also diethylhexyl phthalate and monoethylhexyl phthalate, which have complex and long side chains. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the catalytic triad residues of EstJ6 consists of Ser146, Glu240, and His270. EstJ6 is therefore a promising biodegradation enzyme, and our study illustrates the advantages of a metagenomic approach in identifying enzyme-coding genes for agricultural, food, and biotechnological applications.},

Alternative polymers, marketed as biodegradable, present a potential solution to mitigate their ecological damage. However, understanding of biodegradability has been hindered by a lack of reproducible testing methods. We developed a novel method to evaluate the biodegradability of plastic samples based on the monitoring of bacterial respiration in aqueous media via the quantification of CO2 produced, where the only carbon source available is from the polymer. Rhodococcus rhodochrous and Alcanivorax borkumensis were used as model organisms for soil and marine systems, respectively. Our results demonstrate that this approach is reproducible and can be used with a variety of plastics, allowing comparison of the relative biodegradability of the different materials.

The current demand and production of plastics is putting immense pressure on fossil resources, consuming about 6% of the global oil and is expected to grow up to 20%. The polyester-based biodegradable plastics (BPs) are considered as a remedy to the issue of plastics waste in the environment. BPs appear to manage the overflow of plastics by providing new means of waste management system and help in securing the non-renewable resources of nature. This review comprehensively presents the environmental burdens due to conventional plastics as well as production of polyester-based BPs as an alternative to conventional commodity plastics. The diversity of micro-organisms and their enzymes that degrade various polyester-based BPs (PLA, PCL, PHB/PHBV and PET) has also been described in detail. Moreover, the impact of plastics degradation products on soil ecology and ecosystem functions has critically been discussed. The report ends with special focus on future recommendations for the development of sustainable waste management strategies to control pollution due to plastics waste. Significance and Impact of the Study: Polyester-based BPs considered as a solution to current plastic waste problem as well as leading polymers in terms of biodegradability and sustainability has been critically discussed. The role of microorganisms and their enzymes involved in the biodegradation of these polymers and ecotoxicological impact of degradation products of BPs on soil microbial community and biogeochemical cycles has also been described. This report will provide an insight on the key research areas to bridge the gap for development of simulated systems as an effective and emerging strategy to divert the overflow of plastic in the environment as well as for the greener solution to the plastic waste management problems.},

Strain SS2 was identified through rDNA gene sequencing and showed maximum closeness to Penicillium oxalicum. The newly isolated P. oxalicum strain SS2 had completely degraded PHB and PHBV both in emulsion and films form within 36–48 h at 30 °C. Furthermore, P. oxalicum SS2 degraded PHB and PHBV films in soil environment in lab-built soil microcosms within 1 week. The polymer films were evaluated for changes after degradation through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The PHBV depolymerase enzyme was purified to homogeneity through column chromatography and molecular mass was found approximately 36 kDa. The depolymerase was stable over a wide range of temperature (15–60 °C) and pH (3.0–8.0) with optimum 40 °C and pH 5.0. The enzyme activity was significantly affected by various metal ions and surfactants. The enzyme activity was strongly enhanced in the presence of divalent cationic metal Cu2+ while inhibited by Zn2+ and non-polar detergents Tween 20 and Tween 60. Finally, it is concluded that P. oxalicum strain SS2 has profound degradation capabilities, and can be applied for the treatment of plastic-contaminated environments.},

abstract = {There are numerous reports on poly-$\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerases produced by various microorganisms isolated from various habitats, however, reports on PHB depolymerase production by an isolate from plastic rich sites scares. Although PHB has attracted commercial significance, the inefficient production and recovery methods, inefficient purification of PHB depolymerase and lack of ample knowledge on PHB degradation by PHB depolymerase have hampered its large scale commercialization. Therefore, to ensure the biodegradability of biopolymers, it becomes imperative to study the purification of the biodegrading enzyme system. We report the production, purification, and characterization of extracellular PHB depolymerase from Stenotrophomonas sp. RZS7 isolated from a dumping yard rich in plastic waste. The isolate produced extracellular PHB depolymerase in the mineral salt medium (MSM) at 30°C during 4 days of incubation under shaking. The enzyme was purified by three methods namely ammonium salt precipitation, column chromatography, and solvent purification. Among these purification methods, the enzyme was best purified by column chromatography on the Octyl-Sepharose CL-4B column giving optimum yield (0.7993 Umg-1mL-1). The molecular weight of purified PHB depolymerase was 40 kDa. Studies on the assessment of biodegradation of PHB in liquid culture medium and under natural soil conditions confirmed PHB biodegradation potential of Stenotrophomonas sp. RZS7. The results obtained in Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis, High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) study and Gas Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis confirmed the biodegradation of PHB in liquid medium by Stenotrophomonas sp. RZS7. Changes in surface morphology of PHB film in soil burial as observed in Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis confirmed the biodegradation of PHB under natural soil environment. The isolate was capable of degrading PHB and it resulted in 87.74% biodegradation. A higher rate of degradation under the natural soil condition is the result of the activity of soil microbes that complemented the biodegradation of PHB by Stenotrophomonas sp. RZS7.},

abstract = {Plant genetic diversity can affect ecosystem functioning by enhancing productivity, litter decomposition and resistance to natural enemies. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that genetic diversity may influence ecosystem processes by eliciting functional plasticity among individuals encountering kin or genetically diverse neighbourhoods. We used soil conditioned by groups of closely related (siblings) and diverse genotypes of Deschampsia cespitosa - a species known to exhibit kin recognition via root exudation - to investigate the consequences of kin interactions for root litter decomposition and negative feedback between plants and soil biota. Genetically diverse groups produced root litter that had higher nitrogen (N) content, decomposed faster and resulted in greater N uptake by the next generation of seedlings compared with litter produced by sibling groups. However, a similar degree of negative soil feedback on plant productivity was observed in soil conditioned by siblings and genetically diverse groups. This suggests that characteristics of roots produced by sibling groups slow down N cycling but moderate the expected negative impact of soil pathogens in low-diversity stands. These findings highlight interactions between neighbouring genotypes as an overlooked mechanism by which genetic diversity can affect biotic soil feedback and nutrient cycling.},

Mulching improves crop yield, decreases pesticide' inputs to the field, saves irrigation water and contributes to tackle the food demand for the growing world population. However, plastic mulching results in polyethylene residues that contaminate agricultural soils and contribute to the massive worldwide plastic pollution, a serious environmental concern. Biodegradable plastic mulches (BDM) have emerged as a promising alternative to alleviate polyethylene pollution. BDM, made of different polymers and compositions, are designed to biodegrade in situ, into the agricultural soil. Their use may entail environmental impacts for the agricultural system that deserve to be explored on the short and on the long-term. This review discusses emerging findings on the impact of BDM on agroecosystem organisms, with special emphasis on cultivated plants and on soil organisms. The relevance of the material composition is highlighted by some reports evidencing specific BDM to alter development of cultivated plant species and to modify soil microbiome on the short-term (spanning a few months); model organisms may also be affected. Long-term studies have not yet been attempted. In-depth studies focused on the effects of the diversity of BDM on agroecosystem organisms are urgently required to identify low-impact BDM materials and to guarantee advanced agriculture in a sustainable environment.},

Due to their increasing accretion in aquatic environments, as well as resistance towards degradation, marine litter research has focused on microplastics more recently. In the present study, a relatively new method of biodegradation was implemented for the biodegradation of three structurally different MPs i.e. polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Periphytic biofilm was used for this purpose in various backgrounds of carbon sources (glucose, peptone, and glucose and peptone). Biodegradation of MPs was estimated in terms of weight loss. It was observed that the addition of glucose enhanced the biodegradation of MPs by periphyton biofilm for all MPs (from 9.52%–18.02%, 5.95%–14.02% and 13.24–19.72% for PP, PE and PET respectively) after 60 days compared to natural biofilm alone. To the contrary, peptone, and glucose and peptone together, were inhibitory. Biodegradation was further confirmed by morphological changes observed using SEM, FTIR spectra and GPC lent further support to the results whereby new peaks appeared along with reduction in old peaks and decrease in peak intensities. MiSeq sequencing shows that Deinococcus-thermus > Proteobacteria > Cyanobacteria are the dominant phyla in natural biofilms, and their relative abundances increase after the addition of glucose. However, the abundances shifted to Deinococcus-thermus > Cyanobacteria > Firmicutes > Bacteroidetes, when the biofilms were treated with either peptone alone, or with glucose and peptone together. Therefore, the change in biodegradation capability might also be due to the change in the microbial community structures after addition of the C-sources. These experiments provide an innovative approach towards effective biodegradation of MPs using a relatively new environment-friendly method.},

abstract = {Mulching is widely used to increase crop yield in semiarid regions in northwestern China, but little is known about the effect of different mulching systems on the microbial properties of the soil, which play an important role in agroecosystemic functioning and nutrient cycling. Based on a 4-year spring maize (Zea mays L.) field experiment at Changwu Agricultural and Ecological Experimental Station, Shaanxi, we evaluated the responses of soil microbial activity and crop to various management systems. The treatments were NMC (no mulching with inorganic N fertilizer), GMC (gravel mulching with inorganic N fertilizer), FMC (plasticfilm mulching with inorganic N fertilizer) and FMO (plastic-film mulching with inorganic N fertilizer and organic manure addition). The results showed that the FMO soil had the highest contents of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, dehydrogenase activity, microbial activity and Shannon diversity index. The relative use of carbohydrates and amino acids by microbes was highest in the FMO soil, whereas the relative use of polymers, phenolic compounds and amines was highest in the soil in the NMC soil. Compared with the NMC, an increased but no significant trend of biomass production and nitrogen accumulation was observed under the GMC treatment. The FMC and FMO led a greater increase in biomass production than GMC and NMC. Compare with the NMC treatment, FMC increased grain yield, maize biomass and nitrogen accumulation by 62.2, 62.9 and 86.2%, but no significant difference was found between the FMO and FMC treatments. Some soil biological properties, i.e. microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, being sensitive to the mulching and organic fertilizer, were significant correlated with yield and nitrogen availability. Film mulching over gravel mulching can serve as an effective measure for crop production and nutrient cycling, and plus organic fertilization additions may thus have improvements in the biological quality of the soil and its sustainability in the rainfall-limited semiarid region.},

Biodegradable plastic is a promising alternative to conventional plastic. However, biodegradable plastics must be thoroughly evaluated to ensure that they undergo complete degradation and have no adverse impact on the environment. We evaluated the degradation of biodegradable plastics during 18-week full-scale composting, and determined whether additives from the plastics are released upon degradation. Two biodegradable plastic films—one containing polybutylene co-adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT)and the other containing polylactic acid/poly-hydroxy−alkanoate (PLA/PHA)—were placed into meshbags and buried in the compost. Degradation was assessed by image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, electrophoretic mobility, $\delta$ 13 C isotope analyses, and single particle mass spectrometry of mulch fragments. The results showed >99% macroscopic degradation of PLA/PHA and 97% for PBAT film. Polymers in the biodegradable films degraded; however, micro- and nanoparticles, most likely carbon black, were observed on the meshbags. Overall, biodegradable plastics hold promise, but the release of micro- and nanoparticles from biodegradable plastic upon degradation warrants additional investigation and calls for longer field testing to ensure that either complete biodegradation occurs or that no long-term harm to the environment is caused.},

abstract = {The global use of agricultural plastic films, which provide multiple benefits for food production, is expected to grow by 59% from 2018 to 2026. Disposal options for agricultural plastics are limited and a major global concern, as plastic fragments from all sources ultimately accumulate in the sea. Biodegradable plastic mulches could potentially alleviate the disposal problem, but little is known about how well they degrade under different environmental conditions. We quantified the degradation of biodegradable plastic mulches in compost and in soil at warm and cool climates (Tennessee and Washington). Mulch degradation was assessed by Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, molecular weight analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR), and mulch surface-area quantification. Biodegradable plastic mulches degraded faster in compost than in soil: degradation, as assessed by surface-area reduction, in compost ranged from 85 to 99% after 18 weeks, and in soil from 61 to 83% in Knoxville and 26 to 63% in Mount Vernon after 36 months. FTIR analyses indicate that hydrolytic degradation of ester bonds occurred, and a significant reduction of molecular weight was observed. TGA and NMR confirmed degradation of biodegradable polymers. Our results indicate that biodegradable plastic mulches degrade in soil, but at different rates in different climates and that degradation occurs over several years. Faster degradation occurred in compost, making composting a viable disposal method, especially in cool climates, where mulch fragments in soil may persist for many years.},

abstract = {In modern intensive agriculture, plastics are used in several applications (i.e. mulch films, drip irrigation tubes, string, clips, pots, etc.). Interest towards applying biodegradable plastics to replace the conventional plastics is promising. Ten monomers, which can be applied in the synthesis of potentially biodegradable polyesters, were tested according to ASTM 5988-96 (standard respirometric test to evaluate aerobic biodegradation in soil by measuring the carbon dioxide evolution): adipic acid, azelaic acid, 1,4-butanediol, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, lactic acid, glucose, sebacic acid, succinic acid and terephthalic acid. Eight replicates were carried out for each monomer for 27-45 days. The numerical code AQUASIM was applied to process the CO 2 experimental data in order to estimate values for the parameters describing the different mechanisms occurring to the monomers in soil: i) the first order solubilization kinetic constant, K sol (d -1); ii) the first order biodegradation kinetic constant, K b (d -1); iii) the lag time in biodegradation, t lag (d); and iv) the carbon fraction biodegraded but not transformed into CO 2, Y (-). The following range of values were obtained: [0.006 d -1, 6.9 d -1] for K sol, [0.1 d -1, 1.2 d -1] for K b, and [0.32-0.58] for Y; t lag was observed for azelaic acid, 1,2-ethanediol, and terephthalic acid, with estimated values between 3.0 e 4.9 d. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The increasing use of new generation plastics has been accompanied by the development of standard methods for studying their biodegradability. Generally, test methods are based on the measurement of CO2 production, i.e. the mineralization degree of the tested materials. However, in order to describe the biodegradation process, the determination of the residual amount of tested material which remains in the environment and its chemical characterization can be very important. In this study, the biodegradation in soil of a model polyester (poly(butylene sebacate)) was monitored. Gel Permeation Chromatography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (31P-NMR and 1H-NMR) were used in order to obtain information about the polyester structure and the possible by-products that can be found in soil during and at the end of the incubation. The polyester mineralization (i.e. the CO2 production) was tested according to ASTM 5988 standard method for 245 days. When the polyester mineralization was about 21% and 37% (after 78 and 140 days of incubation) and at the end of the process (63% of mineralization, 100% if compared to the cellulose used as reference material), the soil was extracted with chloroform (solvent of the tested substance) and the extracts were analyzed using GPC and NMR acquisitions. The analytical acquisitions showed high molecular weight polyester in soil during the incubation (78 and 140 days): the polyester concentration decreased but its structure remained almost the same with a slow decreasing in molecular weight. At the end of the test (245 days) no film of the polyester could be extracted from the soil: NMR acquisitions and GPC analyses of the extracts suggested a strong degraded structure of the residual polyester. Even if at the end of the process only 63% of carbon had been lost by mineralization, the whole of the added polyester seems to have disappeared after about eight months of incubation, suggesting substantial biomass formation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The persistence of plastic in soil and aquatic environment has become ecological threat to the metropolitan city such as Bangalore, India. Present study investigates an ecofriendly, efficient and cost-effective approach for plastic waste management by the screening of novel microbial consortia which are capable of degrading plastic polymers. Plastic-contaminated soil and water samples were collected from six hot spots of urban and rural areas of Bangalore. The plastic-degrading bacteria were enriched, and degradation ability was determined by zone of clearance method. The percentage of polymer degradation was initially monitored by weight loss method, and the main isolates were characterized by standard microbiology protocols. These isolates were used to form microbial consortia, and the degradation efficiency of the consortia was compared with individual isolate and known strains obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) and Gene Bank, India. One of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation was identified, and the biodegradation mechanism was hypothesized by bioinformatics studies. From this study, it is evident that the bacteria utilized the plastic polymer as a sole source of carbon and showed 20–50 % weight reduction over a period of 120 days. The two main bacteria responsible for the degradation were microbiologically characterized to be Pseudomonas spp. These bacteria could grow optimally at 37 °C in pH 9.0 and showed 35–40 % of plastic weight reduction over 120 days. These isolates were showed better degradation ability than known strains from MTCC. The current study further revealed that the microbial consortia formulated by combining Psuedomonas spp. showed 40 % plastic weight reduction over a period of 90 days. Further, extracellular lipase, one of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation, was identified. The computational docking studies suggested that polyethylene glycol and polystyrene present in the plastics might have good interaction towards the microbial lipase with stable binding and interacting forces which probably could be one of the reasons for the degradative mechanisms.},

The plastic-degrading bacteria from cow dung samples gathered from highly plastic-acclimated environments were enriched by standard protocols. The degradation ability was comprehended by zone of clearance method, and the percentage of degradation was monitored by weight reduction process. The best isolates were characterized by standard microbiological and molecular biology protocols. The best isolates were employed to form several combinations of microbial consortia, and the degradation end products were analyzed. The stability of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was predicted by bioinformatics approach. This study identified 75 ± 2, 55 ± 2, 60 ± 3, and 43 ± 3% degradation for LDPE strips, pellets, HDPE strips, and pellets, respectively, for a period of 120 days (p < 0.05) at 55 °C by the formulated consortia of IS1-IS4, and the degradation efficiency was found to be better in comparison with other formulations. The end product analysis by Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance showed major structural changes and formation of bacterial biofilm on plastic surfaces. These novel isolates were designated as Bacillus vallismortis bt-dsce01, Psuedomonas protegens bt-dsce02, Stenotrophomonas sp. bt-dsce03, and Paenibacillus sp.bt-dsce04 by 16S rDNA sequencing and suggested good gene stability with minimum Gibb's free energy. Therefore, this study imparts substantial information regarding the utilization of these thermophilic microbial consortia from cow dung for rapid polyethylene removal.},

By high-throughput sequencing and soil metabolomics, we investigated the differential structures and functions of the soil bacterial community in pepper rhizosphere and bulk soils under PGVC. It was found that the soil properties, including the total dissolved organic carbon content, did not show significant differences between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. However, the soil metabolite profiles and the soil bacterial community structures changed in pepper rhizosphere. Eleven differential metabolites were detected between rhizosphere and bulk soils, including organic acids and sugars, which were positively or negatively correlated with the relative abundances of the differential bacteria. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the most differentially expressed metabolic pathway was starch and sucrose metabolism, and the main functional genes participating in this pathway were predicted to be downregulated in rhizosphere soil. This study linked the differential soil microbe and soil metabolite profiles in the pepper rhizosphere under PGVC and provided new insights into plant-microbe interactions in soil.},

In this study, ingestion and biodegradation capability of expanded polystyrene (PS) foam was investigated in a globally distributed soil invertebrate, Achatina fulica. After 4-week exposure, 18.5 ± 2.9 mg polystyrene was ingested per snail, and egested microplastics (1.343 ± 0.625 mm) in feces with significant mass loss of mean 30.7%. Gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated a significant increase in weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and number-average molecular weight (Mn) of feces-residual PS, indicating limited extent depolymerization. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the formation of functional groups of oxidized intermediates. Suppression of gut microbes with oxytetracycline did not affect the depolymerization, indicating the independence of gut microbes. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed significant shifts in the gut microbiome after ingestion of PS, with an increase of family Enterobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, and Aeromonadaceae, suggesting that gut microorganisms were associated with PS biodegradation. These findings suggest that plastic litter can be disintegrated into microplastics and partially biodegraded by A. fulica, which highlights the significance of soil animals for the fate of plastic and its biodegradation in soil environments.},

abstract = {Plastic mulching has become a globally applied agricultural practice for its instant economic benefits such as higher yields, earlier harvests, improved fruit quality and increased water-use efficiency. However, knowledge of the sustainability of plastic mulching remains vague in terms of both an environmental and agronomic perspective. This review critically discusses the current understanding of the environmental impact of plastic mulch use by linking knowledge of agricultural benefits and research on the life cycle of plastic mulches with direct and indirect implications for long-term soil quality and ecosystem services. Adverse effects may arise from plastic additives, enhanced pesticide runoff and plastic residues likely to fragment into microplastics but remaining chemically intact and accumulating in soil where they can successively sorb agrochemicals. The quantification of microplastics in soil remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate analytical techniques. The cost and effort of recovering and recycling used mulching films may offset the aforementioned benefits in the long term. However, comparative and long-term agronomic assessments have not yet been conducted. Furthermore, plastic mulches have the potential to alter soil quality by shifting the edaphic biocoenosis (e.g. towards mycotoxigenic fungi), accelerate C/N metabolism eventually depleting soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellency and favour the release of greenhouse gases. A substantial process understanding of the interactions between the soil microclimate, water supply and biological activity under plastic mulches is still lacking but required to estimate potential risks for long-term soil quality. Currently, farmers mostly base their decision to apply plastic mulches rather on expected short-term benefits than on the consideration of long-term consequences. Future interdisciplinary research should therefore gain a deeper understanding of the incentives for farmers and public perception from both a psychological and economic perspective in order to develop new support strategies for the transition into a more environment-friendly food production.},

abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) pollution in plastic shed soils has become increasingly severe, posing a great threat to human health and social stability. Phytoremediation of cadmium pollution is an environmentally friendly and inexpensive remediation method. In this study, maize (Zea mays L.) was selected as the phytoremediation crop by a potted method, and the bioavailability of cadmium was investigated by adding exogenous elemental sulfur. The relationships among the sulfur content, maize growth, cadmium accumulation, and soil parameters were systematically studied. The results showed that, with the supplement of sulfur, the soil pH and activities of soil enzymes (urease, catalase, and sucrase) decreased gradually, and the available heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Zn, and Cu) in soil showed an upward trend. The optimal cadmium enrichment was achieved under T2 by increasing both the biomass of the maize plant and the cadmium concentration in roots and stems. However, T3 and T4 significantly inhibited the growth of maize roots and shoots, leading to a much lower plant biomass compared with that of CK (sulfur-free treatment) and T2. In addition, the cumulative cadmium was not increased because of the low accumulation of cadmium in some parts of the plant. Correlation analyses showed that the sulfur content was negatively correlated with soil pH and maize biomass (P < 0.01), and the cadmium content of whole maize was positively correlated with the dry weight of maize (P < 0.05) and the cadmium content in roots and stems (P < 0.01). In summary, to optimize cadmium phytoremediation of the plastic shed soil, an appropriate concentration of sulfur should be selected in practical applications to ensure that the biomass of the maize is maximized, and the cadmium concentration in different parts of the maize is increased or stabilized.},

Enchytraeus crypticus were exposed for 21 days to assess effects on survival and reproduction. Soil, pore water and animals were analyzed for Ag. AgNP-Cit had a strong increasing effect on soil pH, leading to high enchytraeid mortality at concentrations higher than 60–100 mg Ag/kg dry soil which made it impossible to determine the influence of soil properties on its toxicity. LC50s were lower for AgNO3 than for AgNP-PVP (92–112 and 335–425 mg Ag/kg dry soil, respectively) and were not affected by soil properties. AgNO3 and AgNP-PVP had comparable reproductive toxicity with EC50s of 26.9–75.2 and 28.2–92.3 mg Ag/kg dry soil, respectively; toxicity linearly increased with decreasing organic carbon content of the soils but did not show a clear effect of soil pH. Ag uptake in the enchytraeids was higher at higher organic carbon content, but could not explain differences in toxicity between soils. This study indicates that the bioavailability of both ionic and nanoparticulate Ag is mainly affected by soil organic carbon, with little effect of soil pH.},

The highest biodegradation rate for Geomyces sp. B10I was noted at 14 °C (25.67% for PBSA and 5.71% for PCL), which suggested a preference for lower temperatures (at 20 °C the biodegradation rate was only 11.34% for PBSA, and 4.46% for PCL). These data showed that microorganisms isolated from Antarctic regions are good candidates for effective plastic degradation at low temperatures.},

Biodegradation of polyacrylic and polyurethane polymers by bacterial and fungal strains has been addressed, but limited information about their biodegradation by microbial communities exists. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of three enriched microbial communities (BP1h, BP3h, and BP7h), selected from deteriorated foam pieces collected in a landfill, to biodegrade the polyacrylic component of the 2K-PU coating Bayhydrol{\textregistered} A2470 and the polyester polyurethane coating NeoRez™ R-9637. Two communities were further selected to quantify extracellular esterase, protease, and urease activities, to identify their taxonomic composition, and to analyze the ability of their isolated members to grow in those polymers. The growth of the three communities was larger in polyester polyurethane than in polyacrylic and their biodegradative activities affected ester, urethane, ether, aromatic, and aliphatic groups of the compounds present in the coatings. From all the communities growing in polyacrylic or in polyester polyurethane, two and five different types of colonies were isolated, respectively. In polyacrylic, extracellular esterase and protease activities were at their maximum level at 7 days of culture, whereas in polyester polyurethane, protease and urease were greatest at 21 days. All the isolated community members were identified as xenobiotics degraders. The complete communities grew better in media with the polymers than the isolated members. This is one of the few studies reporting biodegradation of synthetic polymers by microbial communities and serves as basis for developing synthetic consortia with enhanced degradative abilities.},

This review provides a state of the art of recycling strategies investigated for polyhydroxyalkanoate-based polymers and proposes future research avenues. Research on mechanical and chemical recycling is dominated by the use of extrusion and pyrolysis, respectively, while that on biodegradation of polyhydroxyalkanoates is related to soil and aquatic samples, and to anaerobic digestion towards biogas production. Research gaps exist in the relationships between polymer composition and ease of use of all recycling strategies investigated. This is of utmost importance since it will influence the need for separation at the source. Therefore, research emphasis needs to be given to the area to follow the continuous improvement of the process economics towards widespread commercial production of polyhydroxyalkanoates.},

abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) as emerging contaminants have attracted attention worldwide, but little is known on their interactions with metallic contaminants in soil-plant systems. Here, we investigated the interactions between MPs, i.e., polyethylene (PE) and polylactic acid (PLA), and cadmium (Cd) on plant performance and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community in an agricultural soil. PE showed no noticeable phytotoxicity, while 10% PLA decreased maize biomass and chlorophyll content in leaves. A significant interaction on root biomass occurred between PE and Cd, but not between PLA and Cd. Both PE and PLA caused increase in soil pH and DTPA-extractable Cd concentrations, but no alterations in Cd accumulation in plant tissues. Different numbers of endemic and total OTUs were observed in various treatments. The relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) genera highly varied with MPs and Cd. MPs altered AMF community structure and diversity, depending on their type and dose. Coexisting Cd produced slight but significant interactions with MPs on the dominant AMF genera. Overall, plant growth and AMF community varied with MPs type and dose, Cd, and their interactions, and the high dose of PLA produced stronger phytotoxicity. In conclusion, coexisting MPs and Cd can jointly drive shifts in plant performance and root symbiosis, thereby posing additional risks for agroecosystems and soil biodiversity.},

A fertilization experiment with six N application rates (0, 80, 160, 240, 350 and 450 kg ha−1) with or without mulch was conducted in 2015 and 2016 in the Loess Plateau of China. There were significant interactions between mulch and the N fertilizer rate on the GY. Under mulch treatments, the highest GY was observed at 450 kg ha−1, which was 53.9%, 36.4%, 20.2%, 1.6% and 0.3% higher than those obtained with N application rates of 0, 80, 160, 240 and 350 kg ha−1, respectively, in 2015. The ranking of NT to grain N accumulation was leaves > sheaths and stems > ear axis > bracts. The NT efficiency (NTE) levels averaged over the different N fertilization rates under the no-mulch treatment were 5.6% and 12.9% higher than those under the plastic mulch treatment in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We conclude that an N fertilizer application rate of 240 kg ha−1 with mulch can achieve a relatively higher NTE, GY, WUE and NUE.},

abstract = {Mulching and nitrogen are critical drivers of crop production for smallholders of the Loess Plateau in China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mulching and nitrogen fertilizer on the soil water content, soil nitrate-N content and vertical distribution in maize root-zone. The experiment was conducted over two consecutive years and used randomly assigned field plots with three replicates. The six treatments consisted of no fertilizer without plastic film (CK), plastic film mulching with no basal fertilizer and no top dressing (MN0), basal fertilizer with no top dressing and no mulching (BN1), plastic film mulching and basal fertilizer with no top dressing (MN1), basal fertilizer and top dressing with no mulching (BN2) and plastic film mulching with basal fertilizer and top dressing (MN2). In the top soil layers, the soil water content was a little high in the plastic film mulching than that without mulching. The mean soil water content from 0 to 40 cm without mulching were 3.35%lower than those measured in the corresponding mulching treatments in 31 days after sowing in 2012. The mulching treatment increased the soil nitrate-N content was observed in the 0-40-cm soil layers. The results indicate that high contents of soil nitrate-N were mainly distributed at 0-20-cm at 31 days after sowing in 2012, and the soil nitrate-N concentration in the MN2 treatment was 1.58 times higher than that did not receive fertilizer. The MN2 treatment greatly increased the soil nitrate-N content in the upper layer of soil (0-40-cm), and the mean soil nitrate-N content was increased nearly 50 mg kg-1 at 105 days after sowing compared with CK treatment in 2012. The soil nitrate-N leaching amount in MN1 treatment was 28.61% and 39.14% lower than BN1 treatment, and the mulch effect attained to 42.55% and 65.27% in MN2 lower than BN2 in both years. The yield increased with an increase in the basal fertilizer, top dressing and plastic film mulching, and the grain yield increase ranged from 31.41% to 83.61% in two consecutive years. The MN1 and MN2 treatment is recommended because it increased the grain yield and improved the fertilizer use efficiency, compared with the no-mulching treatment.},

abstract = {Di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), a plasticizer used in many different industrial products, is a frequently observed pollutant in the environment. Biodegradation by microorganisms is considered to be a realistic choice for the remediation of DOP contamination. In the present research, the halotolerant bacterial consortium (LF) enriched in our previous research was used to degrade DOP. It was found that the optimal conditions for LF to degrade DOP was temperature 30oC, pH 6.0, inoculum size >5%, and salt content <3%. LF could degrade a high concentration of DOP (2000 mg/L) with the removal efficiency of 96.33%. Substrate inhibition analyses indicated that the inhibition constant, maximum speciﬁc degradation rate and half-saturation constant were 2544.6 mg/L, 0.7 d−1 and 59.1 mg/L, respectively. Based on the analysis of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the biodegradation pathway for DOP by LF was proposed. Furthermore, LF could degrade DOP in soil (100 mg/kg) with the highest removal efficiency of 89.3%. This study is the first report on DOP biodegradation by bacterial consortium. These results suggest that LF can be used to remediate DOP-contaminated environment.},

The optimal pH and temperature for the degradation of DEHP by Lff were 7.0 and 35 °C, respectively. Lff could degrade high concentrations of DEHP (100–2000 mg/L) with a degradation efficiency of over 91.43%. The DEHP degradation curves fit well with first-order kinetics, with a half-life ranging from 0.598 to 0.746 d. Substrate inhibition analyses showed that the maximum specific degradation rate, half-saturation constant and inhibition constant were 0.8 d−1, 45.8 mg/L and 462.18 mg/L, respectively. A detailed biodegradation pathway of DEHP was proposed based on GC–MS analysis. Furthermore, Lff could also efficiently degrade DEHP in soils. DEHP or DEHP plus Lff changed the bacterial community in soils, and Lff accelerated the shaping of the bacterial community. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform a detailed investigation into the biodegradation of DEHP in soil by Gordonia sp. and its effect on the soil bacterial community. These results suggest that Lff is an ideal candidate for the bioremediation of DEHP-contaminated environments.},

Three plant species: Ceylon spinach, sunflower, and leaf mustard were cultivated in co-contaminated soils under three contamination levels: control (T0), 20 mg kg−1 (T20), and 50 mg kg−1 (T50). The results showed that a higher DEHP and pyrene degradation efficiency was observed evidently in planted cases, increasing from 42 to 53–59% (T0), 61 to 65–76% (T20) and 52 to 68–78% (T50) for DEHP, and from 22 to 30–49% (T0), 58 to 62–72% (T20), and 54 to 57–70% (T50) for pyrene. Under T20 contamination level, soil phospholipid fatty-acid analysis depicted the increased microbial biomass in rhizosphere, especially the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus that is effective for the degradation of organic pollutants. The study also revealed that the activities of dehydrogenase, acid phosphomonoesterase, urease, and phenol oxidase negatively correlated with pollutant concentration. In general, the removal rate of DEHP and pyrene was highest in the soil planted with leaf mustard for each contamination level considered. For soils at T20 level, sunflower and leaf mustard appeared as interesting phytoremediation plants due to the improved removal rates of organic pollutants and the soil microbial activity.},

Current understanding on the occurrences, behaviors, and impacts of MPs in the terrestrial environment is far from complete. A systematic review of the literature was thus conducted to promote the research on MPs in the environment. This work is designed to provide a comprehensive overview that summarizes current knowledge and research findings on environmental occurrences, fate and transport, and impacts of MPs. In addition to discussing the occurrences, characteristics, and sources of MPs in the ocean, freshwater, sediments, soils, and atmosphere, the review also summarizes both the experimental and modeling data of the environmental fate and transport of MPs. Research findings on the toxic effects, bioaccumulation, and bioavailability of MPs in the environment are also covered in this critical review. Future perspectives are discussed as well.},

Here, two rice cultivars with low (Fengyousimiao) and high (Peizataifeng) phthalic acid ester (PAE) accumulation were grown in leaching columns packed with DBP- and DEHP-contaminated soils to investigate their transport, fraction distribution, and accumulation in soil-rice-water system. Significant differences in soil vertical distribution of DBP and DEHP were observed among the two cultivars, sterilization and non-sterilization treatments. Both DBP and DEHP could leach to the bottom layer even though their concentrations in both soil and pore water decreased along with soil depth. DBP and DEHP concentrations in pore water were significantly correlated with those in corresponding soil layer at ripening stage. The available fractions including desorbing and non-desorbing fractions were predominant in the total concentrations of DBP and DEHP of soils. DBP and DEHP storages in coarse soil fractions (i.e., coarse and fine sands) with higher bioavailability displayed higher bioconcentration factors compared to finer soil fractions (i.e., silt and clay), and bioconcentration factors of Peizataifeng were higher than those of Fengyousimiao. The variations in vertical migration and accumulation of DBP and DEHP by the two cultivars implied different adverse effects on the security of groundwater and food.},

abstract = {Soil phosphorus (P) availability and its distribution influence plant growth and productivity, but how they affect the growth dynamics and sex-specific P acquisition strategies of dioecious plant species is poorly understood. In this study, the impact of soil P availability and its distribution on dioecious Populus cathayana was characterized. P. cathayana males and females were grown under three levels of P supply, and with homogeneous or heterogeneous P distribution. Females had a greater total root length, specific root length (SRL), biomass and foliar P concentration under high P supply. Under P deficiency, males had a smaller root system than females but a greater exudation of soil acid phosphatase, and a higher colonization rate and arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal biomass, suggesting a better capacity to mine P and a stronger association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to forage P. Heterogeneous P distribution enhanced growth and root length density (RLD) in females. Female root proliferation in P-rich patches was related to increased foliar P assimilation. Localized P application for increasing P availability did not enhance the biomass accumulation and the morphological plasticity of roots in males, but it raised hyphal biomass. The findings herein indicate that sex-specific strategies in P acquisition relate to root morphology, root exudation and mycorrhizal symbioses, and they may contribute to sex-specific resource utilization patterns and niche segregation.},

abstract = {Phthalate esters (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are used extensively as additives and plasticizers, and have become ubiquitous in the environment. PAEs in the soil could have adverse effects on crop plants as well as humans via accumulations in food chain. Thus, it is important to explore strategies to reduce the bioavailability of phthalate esters. We investigated the effects of Fe-Mn oxide-modified biochar composite (FMBC) applications on the quality of wheat grown in DBP- and DEHP-polluted brown soil. The application of FMBC and biochar (BC) increased the wheat grain biomass by 9.71–223.01% and 5.40–120.15% in the DBP-polluted soil, and 10.52–186.21% and 4.50–99.53% in the DEHP-spiked soil in comparison to the controls. All FMBC treatments were better than the BC treatments, in terms of decreasing DBP and DEHP bioavailability for the wheat grains. The activities of the glutamine synthetase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase in the flag leaves at the filling stage and of granule-bound starch synthase, soluble starch synthase, and adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase in the grains at maturity increased significantly with increases in either the BC or FMBC applications. This, in turn, increased the starch, protein, and amino acid content in the wheat grains. Compared with the BC treatment, the FMBC amendment induced only slight increases in the aforementioned factors. This study offers novel insights into potential strategies for decreasing PAEs bioavailability in soil, with potential positive implications for crop quality and environmental health improvements.},

The results showed that the addition of PR, SPA, EDTA or compost to soils significantly increased the concentration of NaHCO3-extractable As over a 120d incubation period compared with the control (amendment-free) soil. Then, the four amendments were selected to add to As-contaminated soil growing Pteris vittata. It was concluded that As accumulation by the fern increased significantly under the treatments of PR and SPA by 25% and 31%, respectively. For As fractionation in soil, SPA increased Fe-As significantly by 51% and PR increased Ca-As significantly by 18%, while both the two amendments reduced occluded-As by 16% and 19%, respectively. Adding PR and SPA in soil increased the activities of urease and neutral phosphatase resulting from the improvement the fertility and physical structure of the soil, which benefits plant growth and As absorption of P. vittata.

DEHP and its monoester metabolites are responsible for adverse effects on human health. An efficient DEHP-degrading bacterial strain Rhodococcus ruber YC-YT1, with super salt tolerance (0–12% NaCl), is the first DEHP-degrader isolated from marine plastic debris found in coastal saline seawater. Strain YC-YT1 completely degraded 100 mg/L DEHP within three days (pH 7.0, 30°C). According to high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, DEHP was transformed by strain YC-YT1 into phthalate (PA) via mono (2-ethylehxyl) phthalate (MEHP), then PA was used for cell growth. Furthermore, YC-YT1 metabolized initial concentrations of DEHP ranging from 0.5 to 1000 mg/L. Especially, YC-YT1 degraded up to 60% of the 0.5 mg/L initial DEHP concentration. Moreover, compared with previous reports, strain YC-YT1 had the largest substrate spectrum, degrading up to 13 kinds of PAEs as well as diphenyl, p-nitrophenol, PA, benzoic acid, phenol, protocatechuic acid, salicylic acid, catechol, and 1,2,3,3-tetrachlorobenzene. The excellent environmental adaptability of strain YC-YT1 contributed to its ability to adjust its cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) so that 79.7–95.9% of DEHP-contaminated agricultural soil, river water, coastal sediment, and coastal seawater were remedied. These results demonstrate that R. ruber YC-YT1 has vast potential to bioremediate various DEHP-contaminated environments, especially in saline environments.},

Innovations in cropping systems are needed to alleviate this issue. A field experiment was conducted in northwestern China to assess whether straw and plastic managements in wheat/maize intercropping could alleviate these issues. Integrating no tillage with two-year plastic and straw mulching (NTMI2) improved grain yields by 13.8–17.1%, compared to conventional tillage without straw residue and annual new plastic mulching (CTI). The NTMI2 treatment reduced soil evaporation by 9.0–17.3% and the proportion of evaporation to evapotranspiration (E/ET) by 8.6–17.5%, compared to CTI. The NTMI2 treatment weakened wheat competition of soil moisture from maize strip during wheat growth period, and enhanced wheat compensation of soil moisture for maize growth after wheat harvest, compared with CTI. Thus, soil water movement potential of NTMI2 was lowest during wheat growth period, but it was highest during maize-independent growth stage after wheat harvest. The NTMI2 treatment increased evapotranspiration before maize silking, decreased from maize silking to early-filling stage, and increased after the early-filling stage of maize, this effectively coordinated water demand contradiction of intercrops at early and late stages. The NTMI2 treatment improved WUE by 12.4–17.2%, compared with CTI. The improved crop yields and WUE was attributed to the coordinated water competition and compensation, and the decreased soil evaporation and E/ET.},

In this study, the DEHP-degrading bacterial strain RL-JC02 was isolated from red soil with long-term usage of plastic mulch, and it was identified as Gordonia terrae by 16S rRNA gene analysis coupled with physiological and biochemical characterization. The biodegrading capacity of different phthalic acid esters and related intermediates was investigated as well as the performance of strain RL-JC02 under different environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH, salinity and DEHP concentration. Specifically, strain RL-JC02 showed good tolerance to low pH, with 86.6% of DEHP degraded under the initial pH of 5.0 within 72 h. The metabolic pathway of DEHP was examined by metabolic intermediate identification via a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis in which DEHP was hydrolyzed into phthalic acid (PA) and 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) via mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). PA and 2-EH were further utilized through the protocatechuic acid metabolic pathway and $\beta$-oxidation via protocatechuic acid and 2-ethylhexanoic acid, respectively. The application potential of strain RL-JC02 was confirmed through the bioremediation of artificial DEHP-contaminated red soil showing 91.8% DEHP degradation by strain RL-JC02 within 30 d. The kinetics analysis of DEHP degradation by strain RL-JC02 in soil demonstrated that the process followed the modified Gompertz model. Meanwhile, the cell concentration monitoring of strain RL-JC02 in soil with absolute quantification polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) suggested that strain RL-JC02 survived well during bioremediation. This study provides sufficient evidence of a robust degrader for the bioremediation of PAE-contaminated red soil.},

abstract = {Polyethylene mulch films used in agriculture are a major source of plastic pollution in soils. Biodegradable plastics have been introduced as alternative to commonly-used polyethylene. Here we studied the interaction of earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) with polyethylene and biodegradable plastic mulches. The objective was to assess whether earthworms would select between different types of mulches when foraging for food, and whether they drag macroscopic plastic mulch into the soil. Laboratory experiments were carried out with earthworms in Petri dishes and mesocosms. The treatments were standard polyethylene mulch, four biodegradable plastic mulches (PLA/PHA [polylactic acid/polyhydroxy alkanoate], Organix, BioAgri, Naturecycle), a biodegradable paper mulch (WeedGuardPlus), and poplar litter, which served as control. Four and three replicates for the Petri dish and mesocosm experiments were used, respectively. Macroscopic plastic and paper mulch pieces (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm and 2 cm × 2 cm) were collected from an agricultural field after a growing season, after being buried in the soil for 6 and 12 months, and after being composted for 2 weeks. We found that earthworms did not ingest polyethylene. Field-weathered biodegradable plastic mulches were not ingested either, however, after soil burial and composting, some biodegradable plastics were eaten and could not be recovered from soil any longer. Earthworms, when foraging for food, dragged plastic mulch, including polyethylene and biodegradable plastic, and poplar leaves into their burrows. The burial of macroscopic plastic mulch underground led to a redistribution of plastics in the soil profile, and likely enhances the degradation of biodegradable mulches in soil, but also can lead to leaching of plastic fragments by macropore flow.},

abstract = {So far, the effects of the semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) composites with functions of both nutrient slow-release and water retention on soil physicochemical properties, yield, and quality of crops have not been studied. In Part 1 of this paper (Song, J.; Zhao, H.; Zhao, G.; Xiang, Y.; Liu, Y. J. Agric. Food Chem.2019, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b00888), superabsorbent polymers SAPWS (grafting wheat straw (WS) to poly(acrylic-co-acrylamide), which is WS-g-P(AA-co-AM)) and SAPHEC (HEC (hydroxyethyl cellulose)-g-P(AA-co-AM)), and their semi-IPN nanocomposites SI-PSRF/SAPWS and SI-PSRF/SAPHEC (formed by chemical bonding of SAPWS or SAPHEC with PSRF (NPK-containing polymeric slow-release fertilizer)) were prepared, and their microstructures and degradation performances were systematically studied. In this study, effects of these two nanocomposites on soil physicochemical properties, crop yield, and quality as well as soil fertility, especially the relationships between these effects and the degradation performances of the materials themselves, were investigated by a pot experiment of the tomato. Results show that SI-PSRF/SAP nanocomposites can regulate the pH values of weak alkaline soils close to 7.0. The changes of soil pH values, in our study, are basically synchronized with the degradation rates of SI-PSRF/SAP, the higher the degradation rate of SI-PSRF/SAP, the lower the pH value of the alkaline soil treated. Compared with PSRF+SAP (the simple physically mixed system of PSRF and SAP) and PSRF, during the whole growth period of the tomato, SI-PSRF/SAP treatments have the lowest nitrogen release amounts, 4.74 g for SI-PSRF/SAPWS and 4.88 g for SI-PSRF/SAPHEC, the highest nitrogen contents of soils after day 40, and the highest nitrogen contents of plants on day 100, 1.16 and 1.68 g for SI-PSRF/SAPWS and 1.26 and 1.86 g for SI-PSRF/SAPHEC. While for PSRF+SAPWS, PSRF+SAPHEC, and PSRF, they are 5.16 g, 0.81 g, 0.63 g and 5.26 g, 0.87 g, 0.66 g and 5.17 g, 0.63 g, 0.52 g, respectively. There is a significant positive correlation between the material degradation rates and their nitrogen release amounts in this study, while SI-PSRF/SAP systems have the highest correlation coefficient, 0.950. In addition, compared to the control blank, the SI-PSRF/SAP system significantly increases tomato yield, 270.1% for SI-PSRF/SAPWS and 301.7% for SI-PSRF/SAPHEC. Compared with PSRF+SAP, the SI-PSRF/SAP system can make the soil treated become a high-quality soil by influencing the soil pH value, conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, organic carbon, and active organic carbon, which have significant impact on the soil quality. The chemical-bonded functional nanocomposites with a semi-IPN three-dimensional network structures formed by hydrogen-bonding interactions among functional groups of their components can more efficiently improve soil fertility, increase soil nutrient supply capacity, and promote plants growth and development as well as solve the environmental pollution caused by traditional fertilizers. The technology reported in this paper is simple and feasible for large-scale production of fertilizer with both water retention and nutrient slow-release, even nanofertilizer, which has great application potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Root–shoot ratio plays an important role in mulching effects on increases in maize kernel dry weight and grain yield. RESULTS: We examined the effects of plastic film mulching with fertigation on soil nitrate, soil Olsen-P, aboveground and belowground growth, grain filling, and yield of maize. The 2-year research was conducted in a field with a subsoil sand layer (FSS) and in a field without a subsoil sand layer (FNS) in the Hetao Irrigation District, northwest China. Treatments included two levels of plastic film mulching (FM, fully mulched; PM, partially mulched with a cover ratio of 60%), and a non-mulched (NM) control. Mulching methods significantly increased soil NO3-N concentrations (SNCs) in the main root zone in FSS, but not in FNS. Mulching significantly increased root length density in the 0–40 cm soil layer. Mulching increased brace roots emergence by 20.2% under full, and by 9.9% under partial mulching, accelerating soil phosphorus use in the surface soil layer. Mulching increased grain yield in spring maize via enhancing base stem diameter, leaf area, and relative chlorophyll content, decreased the ratio of surface root area to leaf area, and improved kernel dry weight increase. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of base fertilizer to total fertilizer input resulted in nutrient deficiency during reproductive stage in fertigated maize, therefore, applying a portion of base fertilizer after the maize elongation stage is recommended for a further yield increase of mulched fertigated maize. {\textcopyright} 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.},

abstract = {Biochar-modified polyacrylate-like polymers are promising waterborne polymer-based membrane coatings for controlled-release fertilizers. However, the effect of these membrane polymers on paddy soil is unknown. A soil incubation experiment was conducted using Fourier transform infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy to monitor the changes in the polymer-coated membranes in paddy soil, and Biolog EcoPlates and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis were used to detect the effects of the membranes on soil bacterial community profiles. Compared to unmodified membranes, the biodegradation rate of the biochar-modified membrane was slower, and the membrane was more intact, which improved and guaranteed the controlled release of nutrients. Compared to the soil without membranes, the biochar-modified membranes, as well as unmodified ones, showed no significant impacts on the composition diversity of soil dominant bacterial community. The activity and functional diversity of soil culturable microbial community during the early stage of incubation were reduced by biochar-modified membranes due to the release of small amount of soluble organic materials but were both recovered in the 12th month of the incubation period. Therefore, the biochar-modified waterborne polyacrylate was environmentally friendly, demonstrating its potential both in the development of coated controlled-release fertilizers and in the utilization of crop residue.},

abstract = {Plastic materials are widely used in agricultural applications to achieve food security for the growing world population. The use of biodegradable instead of nonbiodegradable polymers in single-use agricultural applications, including plastic mulching, promises to reduce plastic accumulation in the environment. We present a novel approach that allows tracking of carbon from biodegradable polymers into CO2 and microbial biomass. The approach is based on 13C-labeled polymers and on isotope-specific analytical methods, including nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Our results unequivocally demonstrate the biodegradability of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), an important polyester used in agriculture, in soil. Carbon from each monomer unit of PBAT was used by soil microorganisms, including filamentous fungi, to gain energy and to form biomass. This work advances both our conceptual understanding of polymer biodegradation and the methodological capabilities to assess this process in natural and engineered environments.},
