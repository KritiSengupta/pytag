abstract = {Release of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) into agricultural fields is of great concern due to their reported ecotoxicity to organisms that provide beneficial service to the soil such as earthworms, and the potential ability of MPs and NPs to enter the food chain. Most fundamental studies of the fate and transport of plastic particulates in terrestrial environments employ idealized MP materials as models, such as monodisperse polystyrene spheres. In contrast, plastics that reside in agricultural soils consist of polydisperse fragments resulting from degraded films employed in agriculture. There exists a need for more representative materials in fundamental studies of the fate, transport, and ecotoxicity of MPs and NPs in soil ecosystems. The objective of this study was therefore to develop a procedure to produce MPs and NPs from agricultural plastics (a mulch film prepared biodegradable polymer polybutyrate adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) and low-density PE [LDPE]), and to characterize the resultant materials. Soaking of PBAT films under cryogenic conditions promoted embrittlement, similar to what occurs through environmental weathering. LDPE and cryogenically-treated PBAT underwent mechanical milling followed by sieve fractionation into MP fractions of 840 $\mu$m, 250 $\mu$m, 106 $\mu$m, and 45 $\mu$m. The 106 $\mu$m fraction was subjected to wet grinding to produce NPs of average particle size 366.0 nm and 389.4 nm for PBAT and LDPE, respectively. A two-parameter Weibull model described the MPs' particle size distributions, while NPs possessed bimodal distributions. Size reduction did not produce any changes in the chemical properties of the plastics, except for slight depolymerization and an increase of crystallinity resulting from cryogenic treatment. This study suggests that MPs form from cutting and high-impact mechanical degradation as would occur during the tillage into soil, and that NPs form from the MP fragments in regions of relative weakness that possess lower molecular weight polymers and crystallinity.},

abstract = {Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a widely produced plasticizer that is considered to act as an endocrine-disrupting chemical in vertebrates and invertebrates. Indeed, many studies have shown that DEHP alters hormonal levels, reproduction and behavior in vertebrates. Few studies have focused on the effects of DEHP on insects, although DEHP is found almost everywhere in their natural habitats, particularly in soils and plants. Here, we investigated the effects of DEHP on the sexual behavior and physiology of a pest insect, the noctuid moth Spodoptera littoralis. In this nocturnal species, olfaction is crucial for sexual behavior, and ecdysteroids at the antennal level have been shown to modulate sex pheromone detection by males. In the present study, larvae were fed food containing different DEHP concentrations, and DEHP concentrations were then measured in the adults (males and females). Hemolymphatic ecdysteroid concentrations, the antennal expression of genes involved in the ecdysteroid pathway (nuclear receptors EcR, USP, E75, and E78 and calmodulin) and sexual behavior were then investigated in adult males. The success and latency of mating as well as the hatching success were also studied in pairs consisting of one DEHP male and one uncontaminated female or one DEHP female and one uncontaminated male. We also studied the offspring produced from pairs involving contaminated females to test the transgenerational effect of DEHP. Our results showed the general downregulation of nuclear receptors and calmodulin gene expression associated with the higher concentrations of DEHP, suggesting peripheral olfactory disruption. We found some effects on male behavior but without an alteration of the mating rate. Effects on offspring mortality and developmental rates in the N + 1 generation were also found at the higher doses of DEHP. Taken together, the results of the study show for the first time that larval exposure to DEHP can induce delayed endocrine-disruptive effects in the adults of a terrestrial insect as well as effects on the next generation. To date, our study is also the first description of an impact of endocrine disrupter on olfaction in insects.},

A marine bacterium Rhodovulum sp. DBP07 isolated from sea water with proficient of efficiently degrading DBP. The maximum DBP degradation (70.2%) and the cell growth (1.3 OD600nm) were observed at 600 mg/L. The DBP degradation characteristics of the isolate Rhodovulum sp. DBP07 with diverse preliminary concentrations of DBP was found to be 200 ˃ 400 ˃ 600 ˂ 800 ˂ 1000 mg/L DBP. Glucose was identified as most favorable nutrient factor for the enhanced growth and showed 79.8 and 77.4% of degradation rate at 5.0 and 2.0 g/L respectively. The influence of the carbon sources on DBP degradation was found to be Glucose ˃ fructose ˃ sucrose ˃ maltose ˃ lactose ˃ citric acid ˃ starch. Box-Behnken (BBD) statistical optimization results showed enhanced DBP biodegradation rate (91.1%) at pH 7.0, 3% of NaCl concentration with 3 days of incubation. Two intermediate compounds were observed in the retention times of 10.8 and 12.2 which are identified as diethyl phthalate (DEP) and mono-nbutyl phthalate (MBP) using Gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Furthermore, the phthalate (pht) gene expression pattern under DBP stress was analyzed using RT-qPCR and the maximum fold change (5.7 fold) was observed at 3 day of incubation. Overall, the observed results indicate the possibility of utilizing Rhodovulum sp. for remediation of DBP contaminated environment.},

abstract = {Various aspects of performance (e.g., speed, strength, endurance) are thought to be important determinants of the success of animals in natural activities such as foraging, mating, and escaping from predators. However, it is generally known that morphological properties enhancing one type of performance (e.g., strength) can lead to a reduction in another (e.g., speed). Such performance trade-offs have been quantified at the inter-specific level, but evidence at the individual level remains equivocal. To test for the presence of a performance trade-off, we repeatedly captured a total of 189 wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and measured their grip strength and sprint speed. Using the maximum performance score obtained for each individual across all their repeated tests, we obtained a counter-intuitive (and biased) positive and highly significant phenotypic correlation. Using a bivariate mixed model, we detected a significant negative among-individual correlation between grip strength and sprint speed. By contrast, the within-individual correlation was positive but non-significant, thus illustrating the importance of properly partitioning the correlations at the among- and within-individual levels when testing for the presence of a performance trade-off. This study is one of the first to detect a performance trade-off at the among-individual level in a wild animal population. Such a trade-off may be caused by individual differences in muscle physiology and scapular morphology resulting from genetic differences and/or plastic responses to differential use of the arboreal vs. terrestrial parts of the environment.},

abstract = {The impacts of nano- and microplastics (<100 nm and <5 mm, respectively) on terrestrial systems is to the present largely unexplored. Plastic particles are likely to accumulate in these systems primarily by the application of sewage sludge. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of three sizes of plastic particles (50, 500, and 4800 nm) on a terrestrial plant (cress; Lepidium sativum), using a standardized 72 h bioassay. Cress seeds were exposed to five different concentrations of plastics, ranging from 103 to 107 particles mL−1. Germination rate was significantly reduced after 8 h of exposure for all three sizes of plastics, with increased adverse effect with increasing plastic sizes. Seeds exposed to 4800 nm microplastics showed a germination rate decline from 78% in control to 17% in the highest exposure. No difference in germination rate occurred after 24 h of exposure, regardless of the size of the plastic used. Significant differences in root growth were observed after 24 h, but not after 48 or 72 h of exposure. Impacts on germination are likely due to physical blockage of the pores in the seed capsule by microplastics as shown by confocal microscopy of fluorescent microplastics. In later stages, the microplastics particularly accumulated on the root hairs. This is the first detailed study on the effect of nano- and microplastics on a vascular, terrestrial plant, and our results indicate short-term and transient adverse effects.},

abstract = {Particulate plastics in the terrestrial and aquatic environments are small plastic fragments or beads (i.e., 5 mm down to the nanometre range). They have been frequently referred to as ‘micro-plastics' or ‘nano-plastics'. Research has identified particulate plastics as a vector for toxic trace elements in the environment. The adsorption of toxic trace elements by particulate plastics may be facilitated by their high surface area and functionalized surfaces (e.g., through the attachment of natural organic matter). Other factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., pH and water salinity), surface charge, and trace element oxidation status, also influence the adsorption of trace elements onto particulate plastics. Because of their small size and persistence, particulate plastics and the associated toxic trace elements are readily ingested and accumulated in many terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Thus, these plastics can have severe environmental consequences, such as the development of metal toxicity, within aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Humans could also become exposed to particulate plastics through food chain contamination and airborne ingestion. This review provides an overview of the sources of particulate plastics in the environment. To this end, we describe particulate plastics made of synthetic polymers, their origin, and characteristics with emphasis on how particulate plastics and associated toxic trace elements contaminate terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Future research needs and strategies are discussed to help reduce the environmental risks of particulate plastics as a potent vector for the transportation of toxic trace elements.},

abstract = {Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and social issues of the 21st century. Recent work has highlighted the atmosphere's role in transporting microplastics to remote locations [S. Allen et al., Nat. Geosci. 12, 339 (2019) and J. Brahney, M. Hallerud, E. Heim, M. Hahnenberger, S. Sukumaran, Science 368, 1257-1260 (2020)]. Here, we use in situ observations of microplastic deposition combined with an atmospheric transport model and optimal estimation techniques to test hypotheses of the most likely sources of atmospheric plastic. Results suggest that atmospheric microplastics in the western United States are primarily derived from secondary re-emission sources including roads (84%), the ocean (11%), and agricultural soil dust (5%). Using our best estimate of plastic sources and modeled transport pathways, most continents were net importers of plastics from the marine environment, underscoring the cumulative role of legacy pollution in the atmospheric burden of plastic. This effort uses high-resolution spatial and temporal deposition data along with several hypothesized emission sources to constrain atmospheric plastic. Akin to global biogeochemical cycles, plastics now spiral around the globe with distinct atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, and terrestrial residence times. Though advancements have been made in the manufacture of biodegradable polymers, our data suggest that extant nonbiodegradable polymers will continue to cycle through the earth's systems. Due to limited observations and understanding of the source processes, there remain large uncertainties in the transport, deposition, and source attribution of microplastics. Thus, we prioritize future research directions for understanding the plastic cycle.},

abstract = {Human muscles, limbs and supporting ventilatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic systems are well adapted for walking, and there is reasonable transfer of efficiency of movement to bicycling. Our efficiency and economy of movement of bipedal walking (≈30%) are far superior to those of apes. This overall body efficiency during walking and bicycling represents the multiplicative interaction of a phosphorylative coupling efficiency of ≈60%, and a mechanical coupling efficiency of ≈50%. These coupling efficiencies compare well with those of other species adapted for locomotion. We are capable runners, but our speed and power are inferior to carnivorous and omnivorous terrestrial mammalian quadrupeds because of biomechanical and physiological constraints. But, because of our metabolic plasticity (i.e., the ability to switch among carbohydrate (CHO)- and lipid-derived energy sources) our endurance capacity is very good by comparison to most mammals, but inferior to highly adapted species such as wolves and migratory birds. Our ancestral ability for hunting and gathering depends on strategy and capabilities in the areas of thermoregulation, and metabolic plasticity. Clearly, our competitive advantage of survival in the biosphere depends in intelligence and behavior. Today, those abilities that served early huntergatherers make for interesting athletic competitions due to wide variations in human phenotypes. In contemporary society, the stresses of regular physical exercise serve to minimize morbidities and mortality associated with physical inactivity, overnutrition, and aging. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physiological Society.},

In this study, the bacterial taxon and functional composition of soil microplastic-attached communities at Guiyu, a notorious e-waste dismantling area in Guangdong Province, China, were investigated by means of high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed that fundamental difference in bacterial communities existed among microplastics selected from three plots with different dismantling methods and their surroundings, suggesting that microplastic surface created a new ecological niche in soil environment, and the bacteria adapted well to the surface-related lifestyle. The formation of microplastic-attached bacteria depended not only on various dismantled plastic materials, but also on disassembly methods that caused different soil physicochemical characters which might also influence the bacterial communities. As the hydrocarbon degraders, the family Hyphomonadaceae were also found on soil microplastic, further confirming that microorganisms played a role in biodegrading microplastic in e-waste zone. The analysis of functional profiles speculated that microplastic-attached bacteria had the potential to degrade pollutants. This study provides a new perspective for exploring microplastic-associated bacteria and increasing our understanding of microplastic pollution in terrestrial ecosystems.},

The ingestion of HDPE and PP microplastics by M. guillelmi was clearly demonstrated by Nile Red fluorescence staining method. There were significant differences for the microbiota between the M. guillelmi gut and the surrounding soil, which may result from the influence of specific conditions in the gut habitat. HDPE and PP microplastics exposure did not induce gut microbiota dysbiosis in M. guillelmi. However, PP microplastics exposure significantly reduced bacterial diversity and altered bacterial community structure in the soil. Specifically, the relative abundance of Aeromonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae significantly increased while the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and two unidentified families affiliated with Proteobacteria significantly decreased. This study broadens our understanding of the ecotoxicity of microplastics on the soil and gut microbiota of terrestrial organisms.},

Until now, little is known about the comparative uptake and translocation of PAEs and mPAEs in plants. In the present study, the uptake and translocation of two commonly used plasticizers, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and the corresponding mPAEs, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) by Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) were examined using hydroponic experiment. Significantly lower bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of mPAEs compared to the corresponding PAEs were observed. This is likely due to the great solubility and electrical repulsion from cell membrane to mPAE anions. Comparatively low translocation factors (TFs) of MnBP (7.76 ± 0.49) were observed compared to DnBP (10.33 ± 2.83); while the TFs of MEHP (0.18 ± 0.08) were significantly greater than that of DEHP (0.05 ± 0.02). The hydrophilic mPAEs are prone to concentrate in cell water-soluble components, and DnBP was relatively uniformly distributed in cell wall and cell water-soluble components; while the more hydrophobic DEHP was mainly associated with root cell wall. The formation of mPAEs occurred mainly in the above-ground tissues in the PAEs spiked treatment, and cell water-soluble compartment was the main location for PAEs metabolism. The high metabolite/parent ratios in Chinese cabbage indicate that more concern should be directed towards metabolites associated with plants via direct uptake and plant metabolism.},

Human-induced changes, such as deforestation, may profoundly affect these pathways. However, the strength of individual factors on stream ecosystems is poorly understood since the factors involved often interact in complex ways. We isolated two of these factors, manipulating the flux of terrestrial input and the intensity of light in a 2×2 factorial design, where we followed the growth and diet of two size-classes of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and the development of periphyton, grazer macroinvertebrates, terrestrial invertebrate inputs, and drift in twelve 20 m long enclosed stream reaches in a five-month-long experiment in a boreal coniferous forest stream. We found that light intensity, which was artificially increased 2.5 times above ambient levels, had an effect on grazer density, but no detectable effect on chlorophyll a biomass. We also found a seasonal effect on the amount of drift and that the reduction of terrestrial prey input, accomplished by covering enclosures with transparent plastic, had a negative impact on the amount of terrestrial invertebrates in the drift. Further, trout growth was strongly seasonal and followed the same pattern as drift biomass, and the reduction of terrestrial prey input had a negative effect on trout growth. Diet analysis was consistent with growth differences, showing that trout in open enclosures consumed relatively more terrestrial prey in summer than trout living in covered enclosures. We also predicted ontogenetic differences in the diet and growth of old and young trout, where we expected old fish to be more affected by the terrestrial prey reduction, but we found little evidence of ontogenetic differences. Overall, our results showed that reduced terrestrial prey inputs, as would be expected from forest harvesting, shaped differences in the growth and diet of the top predator, brown trout. {\textcopyright} 2012 Ero{double acute}s et al.},

abstract = {Phthalate esters (PAEs), a family of emerging environmental contaminants, have been frequently detected in soils and water. However, intensive studies on the toxicity of PAEs have focused on growth response of terrestrial and aquatic animals, while only limited attention has been paid to aquatic plants, especially phytoplankton, the primary producer in aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, the acute toxic effects and underlying mechanisms of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at different concentrations (0–20 mg L−1) on two typical freshwater algae (Scenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella pyrenoidosa) were investigated. The growth of S. obliquus and C. pyrenoidosa was conspicuously inhibited by DBP exposure at 2–20 mg L−1. The 96-h median effective concentration values (96h-EC50) were 15.3 mg L−1 and 3.14 mg L−1 for S. obliquus and C. pyrenoidosa, respectively, implying that the spherical C. pyrenoidosa is more sensitive to DBP than the spindle-shaped S. obliquus. As expected from the damage done to cell organelles (i.e. cell membranes, chloroplasts, and protein rings), cell densities and chlorophyll content conspicuously decreased under DBP treatments. Moreover, the algal growth inhibition was closely linked to the increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content, indicating oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in both algae. This was proved by the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of toxic mechanisms in PAEs and the evaluation of environmental risks for primary producers in aquatic ecosystems.},

In adsorption experiments fragmented HDPE bags c. one mm2 in size showed similar sorption characteristics to soil. However, when present in combination with soil, concentrations of adsorbed Zn on a per mass basis were over an order of magnitude lower on microplastics. Desorption of the Zn was minimal from both microplastics and soil in synthetic soil solution (0.01 M CaCl2), but in synthetic earthworm guts desorption was higher from microplastics (40-60%) than soil (2-15%), suggesting microplastics could increase Zn bioavailability. Individual Lumbricus terrestris earthworms exposed for 28 days in mesocosms of 260 g moist soil containing 0.35 wt % of Zn-bearing microplastic (236-4505 mg kg-1) ingested the microplastics, but there was no evidence of Zn accumulation, mortality, or weight change. Digestion of the earthworms showed that they did not retain microplastics in their gut. These findings indicate that microplastics could act as vectors to increase metal exposure in earthworms, but that the associated risk is unlikely to be significant for essential metals such as Zn that are well regulated by metabolic processes.},

abstract = {Concerns regarding microplastic contamination have spread from aquatic environments to terrestrial systems with a growing number of studies have been reported. Notwithstanding, the potential effects on soil ecosystems remain largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of polyethylene microplastics on soil enzymatic activities and the bacterial community were evaluated, and the microbiota colonizing on microplastics were also investigated. Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per kg soil) significantly increased the urease and catalase activities in soil after 15 days, and no discernible alteration of invertase activities was detected. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversities (richness, evenness, and diversity) of the microbiota in soil were not obviously changed by the PE amendment, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on plastic fragments were significantly lower than those in the control and amended soils. Different taxonomic composition was observed in between the control and amended soils after 90 days of incubation. Bacterial assemblages with distinct community structure colonized the PE microplastics. Additionally, several taxa including plastic-degrading bacteria and pathogens were more abundant on microplastics. Simultaneously, the predicted functional profiles showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were higher on the microplastics. These results indicated that microplastics in soil, compared with those in aquatic environments, can also act as a distinct microbial habitat, potentially altering the ecological functions of soil ecosystems.},

Due to the high production volumes and disposal of products made from BPA, polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, BPA has entered terrestrial and aquatic environments. In the presence of oxygen, diverse taxa of bacteria, fungi, algae and even higher plants metabolize BPA, but anaerobic microbial degradation has not been documented. Recent reports demonstrated that abiotic processes mediate BPA transformation and mineralization in the absence of oxygen, indicating that BPA is susceptible to degradation under anoxic conditions. This review summarizes biological and nonbiological processes that lead to BPA transformation and degradation, and identifies research needs to advance predictive understanding of the longevity of BPA and its transformation products in environmental systems.},

The emergence of these plastic pollutants in agroecosystem is a legitimate ecotoxicological concerns for food web exchanges. In agriculture, micro/nano plastics are originated from a variety of different agricultural management practices, such as the use of compost, sewage sludge and mulching. A range of soil properties and plant traits are affected by their presence. With the increase of plastic debris, these pollutant materials have now begun to demonstrate serious implications for key soil ecosystem functions, such as soil microbial activity and nutrient cycling. Nitrogen (N) cycle is key predictor of ecological stability and management in terrestrial ecosystem. In this review, we evaluate ecological risks associated with micro-nano plastic for soil-plant system. We also discuss the consequence of plastic pollutants, either positive or negative, on soil microbial activities. In addition, we systematically summarize both direct and hypothesized implications for N cycling in agroecosystem. We conclude that soil N transformation had showed varied effects resulting from different types and sizes of plastic polymers present in soil. While mixed effects of microplastic pollution on plant growth and yield have been observed, biodegradable plastics have appeared to pose greater risk for plant growth compared to chemical plastic polymers.},

However, knowledge of the plastic-associated microbial community (the plastisphere) in the intertidal zone is scanty. We used high-throughput sequencing to profile the bacterial communities attached to microplastic samples from intertidal locations around the Yangtze estuary in China. The structure and composition of plastisphere communities varied significantly among the locations. We found the taxonomic composition on microplastic samples was related to their sedimentary and aquatic origins. Correlation network analysis was used to identify keystone bacterial genera (e.g. Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales), which represented important microbial associations within the plastisphere community. Other species (i.e. potential pathogens) were considered as hitchhikers in the plastic attached microbial communities. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested adaptations of these bacterial assemblages to the plastic surface-colonization lifestyle. These adaptations included reduced “cell motility” and greater “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism.” The findings illustrate the diverse microbial assemblages that occur on microplastic and increase our understanding of plastisphere ecology.},

However, there are still very limited data regarding the risks of MPs to animals, especially higher mammals. In this study, we exposed male mice to 5 $\mu$m pristine and fluorescent polystyrene MP for six weeks. The results showed that the polystyrene MP was observed in the guts of mice and could reduce the intestinal mucus secretion and cause damage the intestinal barrier function. In addition, high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to explore the change of the gut microbiota composition in the cecal content. At the phylum level, the content of Actinobacteria decreased significantly in the polystyrene MP-treated group. The PD whole-tree indexes of the alpha diversity and principal component analysis (PCA) of the beta diversity indicated that the diversity of gut microbiota was altered after polystyrene MP exposure. At the genus level, a total of 15 types of bacteria changed significantly after exposure to polystyrene MP. Furthermore, the predicted KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) metabolic pathway differences indicated that the main metabolic pathways of the functional genes in the microbial community were significantly influenced by the polystyrene MP. In addition, indexes of amino acid metabolism and bile acid metabolism in the serum were analyzed after polystyrene MP exposure. These results indicated that polystyrene MP caused metabolic disorders. In conclusion, the polystyrene MP induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction and metabolic disorders in mice. This study provided more data on the toxicity of MPs in a terrestrial organism to aid in the assessment of the health risks of polystyrene MP to animals.},

abstract = {The presence and accumulation of plastic and microplastic (MP) debris in the natural environment is of increasing concern and has become the focus of attention for many researchers. Plastic debris is a prolific, long-lived pollutant that is highly resistant to environmental degradation, readily adheres hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants and is linked to morbidity and mortality in numerous aquatic organisms. The prevalence of MPs within the natural environment is a symptom of continuous and rapid growth in synthetic plastic production and mismanagement of plastic waste. Many terrestrial and marine-based processes, including domestic and industrial drainage, maritime activities agricultural runoff and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent, contribute to MP pollution in aquatic environments. MPs have been identified in food consumed by human and in air samples, and exposure to MPs via ingestion or inhalation could lead to adverse human health effects. Regulations in many countries have already been established or will soon be implemented to reduce MPs in aquatic environments. This review focuses on the occurrence, sources, and transport of MPs in terrestrial and aquatic environments to highlight potential human health effects, and applicable regulations to mitigate impacts of MPs. This study also highlights the importance of personality traits and cognitive ability in reducing the entry of MPs into the environment.},

Their high persistence nature and release of chemicals/additives used in synthesis of plastics materials may pose cascading impacts on living organism across the globe. Natural connectivity of all the environmental compartments (terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric) leads to migration/dispersion of MNPs from one compartment to others. Nevertheless, the information on dispersion of MNPs across the environmental compartments and its possible impacts on living organisms are still missing. This review first acquaints with dispersion mechanisms of MNPs in the environment, its polymeric/oligomeric and chemical constituents and then emphasized its impacts on living organism. Based on the existing knowledge about the MNPs' constituent and its potential impacts on the viability, development, lifecycle, movements, and fertility of living organism via several potential mechanisms, such as irritation, oxidative damage, digestion impairment, tissue deposition, change in gut microbial communities' dynamics, impaired fatty acid metabolism, and molecular damage are emphasized. Finally, at the end, the review provided the challenges associated with remediation of plastics pollutions and desirable strategies, policies required along with substantial gaps in MNPs research were recommended for future studies.},

We studied the bacterial adherence, degradation and destabilization of polyvinylchloride (PVC), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) by marine bacterial strain AIIW2 by a series of analytical and microscopic observations over 3 months. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence and the phylogenetic analysis of the strain AIIW2, it showed 97.39% similarity with Bacillus species. Degradation of plastics was determined by the weight loss after 90 days with bacterial strain which detected up to 0.26 ± 0.02, 0.96 ± 0.02, and 1.0 ± 0.01% for PVC, LDPE, and HDPE films, respectively over initial weights. The mineralization of plastic film was found to be maximum in LDPE followed by HDPE and PVC. Bacterial interaction had increased roughness and deteriorated the surface of plastics which is revealed by the scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. Bending vibrations of the alkane rock chain (–CH 2 and –CH 3 ) and carbonyl (–CO) regions in LDPE and HDPE films, while there was slight stretching in the hydroxyl (–OH) regions of carboxylic acid in PVC which is evidenced through Fourier transform infrared spectral studies, suggested the oxidative activities of the bacteria. Though, the bacterial activity was higher on the LDPE and HDPE than PVC film which may be due to the presence of chlorine atom in PVC structure making it more versatile. The results of the present study revealed the ability of marine bacterial strain for instigating their colonization over plastic films and deteriorating the polymeric structure.},

A critical need for advancing environmental health and safety research for nanomaterials is to identify physical and chemical transformations that affect the nanomaterial properties and their toxicity. Silver nanoparticles, one of the most toxic and well-studied nanomaterials, readily react with sulfide to form Ag(0)/Ag2S core-shell particles. Here, we show that sulfidation decreased silver nanoparticle toxicity to four diverse types of aquatic and terrestrial eukaryotic organisms (Danio rerio (zebrafish), Fundulus heteroclitus (killifish), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm), and the aquatic plant Lemna minuta (least duckweed)). Toxicity reduction, which was dramatic in killifish and duckweed even for low extents of sulfidation (about 2 mol % S), is primarily associated with a decrease in Ag+ concentration after sulfidation due to the lower solubility of Ag2S relative to elemental Ag (Ag0). These results suggest that even partial sulfidation of AgNP will decrease the toxicity of AgNPs relative to their pristine counterparts. We also show that, for a given organism, the presence of chloride in the exposure media strongly affects the toxicity results by affecting Ag speciation. These results highlight the need to consider environmental transformations of NPs in assessing their toxicity to accurately portray their potential environmental risks. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Pesticides are frequently applied to agricultural soil to reduce the effects of pests on crops, but may also affect the degradation of plastics.

Changes of surface functional groups and morphologies were measured by FTIR and SEM, while metal concentrations were determined by ICPMS. Prothioconazole was found to promote plastic degradation. PBAT degraded faster and adsorbed more heavy metals from the soil than PE. Whether the microplastics adsorb or release heavy metals depended on the metal and their concentrations. Prothioconazole inhibited the adsorption of Cr, As, Pb and Ba by microplastics, promoted the adsorption of Cu, and had no significant effect for Sn. These results can help to assess the ecological risk of microplastic pollution from plastic mulch when combined with heavy metals.},

Meanwhile, several questions related to its sources; toxicity, distribution and fate still remain unanswered. Most of the evidence until date suggests that DEHP is an omnipresent compound found in different ecological compartments and its higher hydrophobicity and low volatility have resulted in significant adsorption to solids matrix. In fact, there are important issues to be addressed with regard to the toxicity of this compound in both animals and humans, its behavior in different ecological systems, and the transformation products generated during different biological or advanced chemical treatments.

In order to partially fill this gap, we used a mass spectrometry based functional proteomics to evaluate the modulation of protein profiling in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), one of the most useful freshwater biological model. Mussels were exposed for 6 days in static conditions to two different microplastic mixtures, composed by two types of virgin polystyrene microbeads (size = 1 and 10 $\mu$m)each one.

Proteomics' analyses of gills showed the complete lack of proteins' modulation after the exposure to the low-concentrated mixture, while even 78 proteins were differentially modulated after the exposure to the high-concentrated one, suggesting the presence of an effect-threshold.

The results were compared with the positive control (PC) (400 mg/L chlorpyrifos).

In this chapter, we present some of the current studies on this topic and methods to enrich and cultivate plastic-degrading microbial consortia from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, including substrate preparation and biodegradation assessment. We focus on both conventional and biodegradable plastics as potential growth substrates. Cultivation methods for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms are presented.},

abstract = {Because of their large and widespread application, phthalates or phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are ubiquitous in all the environmental compartements. They have been widely detected throughout the worldwide environment. Indoor air where people spend 65-90% of their time is also highly contaminated by various PAEs released from plastics, consumer products as well as ambient suspended particulate matter. Because of their widespread application, PAEs are the most common chemicals that humans are in contact with daily. Based on various exposure mechanisms, including the ingestion of food, drinking water, dust/soil, air inhalation and dermal exposure the daily intake of PAEs may reach values as high as 70 $\mu$g/kg/day. PAEs are involved in endocrine disrupting effects, namely, upon reproductive physiology in different species of fish and mammals. They also present a variety of additional toxic effects for many other species including terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora. Therefore, their presence in the environment has attracted considerable attention due to their potential impacts on ecosystem functioning and on public health. This paper is a synthesis of the extensive literature data on behavior, transport, fate and ecotoxicological state of PAEs in environmental matrices: air, water, sediment, sludge, wastewater, soil, and biota. First, the origins and physicochemical properties of PAEs that control the behavior, transport and fate in the environment are reviewed. Second, the compilation of data on transport and fate, adverse environmental and human health effects, legislation, restrictions, and ecotoxicological state of the environment based on PAEs is presented.},

abstract = {Information on the occurrence and effects of nanoplastics in ecosystems worldwide currently represent one of the main challenges from the ecotoxicological point of view. This is particularly true for terrestrial environments, in which nanoplastics are released directly by human activities or derive from the fragmentation of larger plastic items incorrectly disposed. Since insects can represent a target for these emerging contaminants in land-based community, the aim of this study was the evaluation of ingestion of 0.5 $\mu$m polystyrene nanoplastics and their effects in silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae, a useful and well-studied insect model. The ingestion of nanoplastics, the possible infiltration in the tissues and organ accumulation were checked by confocal microscopy, while we evaluated the effects due to the administered nanoplastics through a multi-tier approach based on insect development and behaviour assessment, as endpoints at organism level, and the measurements of some biochemical responses associated with the imbalance of the redox status (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione s-transferase, reactive oxygen species evaluation, lipid peroxidation) to investigate the cellular and molecular effects. We observed the presence of microplastics in the intestinal lumen, but also inside the larvae, specifically into the midgut epithelium, the Malpighian tubules and in the haemocytes. The behavioural observations revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase of erratic movements and chemotaxis defects, potentially reflecting negative indirect effects on B. mori survival and fitness, while neither effect on insect development nor redox status imbalance were measured, with the exception of the significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of superoxide dismutase activity.},

abstract = {Biodegradable plastics made from biopolymers (made in nature) or from bio-based polymers (made in a factory) are becoming increasingly important in replacing the massive amounts of conventional, non-degradable fossil-based plastics that have been produced and disposed over the past decades. In this review we compare the biodegradation rates and mechanisms of the bioplastics thermoplastic starch, cellulose acetate and lignin based bioplastics with the biodegradation rates and mechanisms of starch, cellulose and lignin, which are the unmodified biopolymers from which these bioplastics are produced. With this comparison we aim to determine to what extent the extensive knowledge on unmodified biopolymer biodegradation can be applied to the biodegradation of bioplastics (modified biopolymers) in the terrestrial environment. This knowledge is important, since it can be of great help in giving direction to the future research and development of bioplastics and for the development of bioplastic waste assessments and policies. We found that the similarities and differences in biodegradation are dependent on the structural changes imposed on a biopolymer during the bioplastic production process. A change in higher level structure, as found in thermoplastic starch, only resulted in a limited number of differences in the biodegradation process. However, when the chemical structure of a polymer is changed, as for cellulose acetate, different microorganisms and enzymes are involved in the biodegradation. Based on the cellulose acetate biodegradation process, a conceptual model was proposed that can be used as a starting point in predicting biodegradation rates of other chemically modified biopolymers used as bioplastics. Future bioplastic biodegradation research should focus on conducting long-term field experiments, since most studies are conducted in a laboratory setting and do not capture all processes occurring in the field situation. This applies even more to lignin based bioplastics, since very little experimental data were available on modified lignin biopolymer biodegradation.},

In terrestrial environments, microfibres (MFs) generated from textile laundering are believed to form a significant component of MPs entering soils, mainly through sewage sludge and compost applications. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of MFs on a keystone soil organism. We exposed the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris to soil with polyester MFs incorporated at rates of 0, 0.1 and 1.0 %w/w MF for a period of 35 days (in the dark at 15 °C; n = 4 for each treatment). Dried plant litter was applied at the soil surface as a food source for the earthworms. We assessed earthworm vitality through mortality, weight change, depurate production and MF avoidance testing. In addition, we measured stress biomarker responses via the expression of metallothionein-2 (mt-2), heat shock protein (hsp70) and superoxide dismutase (sod-1). Our results showed that exposure and ingestion of MFs (as evidenced by subsequent retrieval of MFs within earthworm depurates) were not lethal to earthworms, nor did earthworms actively avoid MFs. However, earthworms in the MF1.0% treatment showed a 1.5-fold lower cast production, a 24.3-fold increase in expression of mt-2 (p < 0.001) and a 9.9-fold decline in hsp70 expression (p < 0.001). Further analysis of soil and MF samples indicated that metal content was not a contributor to the biomarker results. Given that burrowing and feeding behaviour, as well as molecular genetic biomarkers, were modulated in earthworms exposed to MFs, our study highlights potential implications for soil ecosystem processes due to MF contamination. Microfibre contamination has potential implications for soil ecosystems as exposure of Lumbricus terrestris to soil-microfibre mixtures reduced burrowing and altered physiology.},

abstract = {Since the last few decades, the promiscuous and uncontrolled use of plastics led to the accumulation of millions of tons of plastic waste in the terrestrial and marine environment. It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate change. The concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of plastics containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient, eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few microbial agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and characterized for plastic degradation , but with low efficiency. It might be due to the predominance of uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain unexplored from the respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this problem, metagenomic analysis of microbial population engaged in the plastic biodegradation is advisable to decipher the microbial community structure and to predict their biodegradation potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis allow the rapid meta-genome screening that helps in the identification of total microbial community and also opens up the scope for mining genes or enzymes (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in polymer degradation. Further , the extraction of the core microbial population and their adaptation, fitness, and survivability can also be deciphered through comparative metagenomic study. It will help to engineer the microbial community and their metabolic activity to speed up the degradation process.},

However, high amounts of conventional plastics have been accumulating in the environment since several years. Although many studies reported on their potential biodegradation by microbes in and from terrestrial environments, very little is known about the biodegradability of these plastics in freshwater systems and only recently more reports on their biodegradation by marine microorganisms/in marine environment were made available.

abstract = {In salt marshes, the alternation of low and high tides entails rapid shifts of submersion and aerial exposure for terrestrial communities. In these intertidal environments, terrestrial species have to deal with an osmotic loss in body water content and an increase in sodium chloride concentration when salt load increases. In salt marshes, spiders represent an abundant arthropod group, whose physiological ecology in response to variations of soil salinity must be further investigated. In this study, we compared the effect of salinity on the survival and physiology of three species of Lycosidae; two salt marsh species (Arctosa fulvolineata and Pardosa purbeckensis) and one forest species (P. saltans). Spiders were individually exposed at three salinity conditions (0‰, 35‰ and 70‰) and survival, changes in body water content, hemolymph ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+; ICP-MS technique) and metabolites (mainly amino acids, polyols, sugars; LC and GC techniques) were assessed. The survival of the forest species P. saltans was very quickly hampered at moderate and high salinities. In this spider, variations of hemolymph ions and metabolites revealed a quick loss of physiological homeostasis and a rapid salt-induced dehydration of the specimens. Conversely, high survival durations were measured in the two salt-marsh spiders, and more particularly in A. fulvolineata. In both P. purbeckensis and A. fulvolineata, the proportion of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ remained constant at the three experimental conditions. Accumulation of hemolymph Na+ and amino acids (mainly glutamine and proline) demonstrated stronger osmoregulatory capacities in these salt-marsh resident spiders. To conclude, even if phylogenetically close (belonging to the same, monophyletic, family), we found different physiological capacities to cope with salt load among the three tested spider species. Nevertheless, physiological responses to salinity were highly consistent with the realized ecological niches of the spiders.},

abstract = {Bergmann's rule is the propensity for species-mean body size to decrease with increasing temperature. Temperature-dependent oxygen limitation has been hypothesized to help drive temperature–size relationships among ectotherms, including Bergmann's rule, where organisms reduce body size under warm oxygen-limited conditions, thereby maintaining aerobic scope. Temperature-dependent oxygen limitation should be most pronounced among aquatic ectotherms that cannot breathe aerially, as oxygen solubility in water decreases with increasing temperature. We use phylogenetically explicit analyses to show that species-mean adult size of aquatic salamanders with branchial or cutaneous oxygen uptake becomes small in warm environments and large in cool environments, whereas body size of aquatic species with lungs (i.e., that respire aerially), as well as size of semiaquatic and terrestrial species do not decrease with temperature. We argue that oxygen limitation drives the evolution of small size in warm aquatic environments for species with aquatic respiration. More broadly, the stronger decline in size with temperature observed in aquatic versus terrestrial salamander species mirrors the relatively strong plastic declines in size observed previously among aquatic versus terrestrial invertebrates, suggesting that temperature-dependent oxygen availability can help drive patterns of plasticity, micro- and macroevolution.},

abstract = {The ability to maintain a (relatively) stable body temperature in a wide range of thermal environments by use of endogenous heat production is a unique feature of endotherms such as birds. Endothermy is acquired and regulated via various endocrine and molecular pathways, and ultimately allows wide aerial, aquatic, and terrestrial distribution in variable environments. However, due to our changing climate, birds are faced with potential new challenges for thermoregulation, such as more frequent extreme weather events, lower predictability of climate, and increasing mean temperature. We provide an overview on thermoregulation in birds and its endocrine and molecular mechanisms, pinpointing gaps in current knowledge and recent developments, focusing especially on non-model species to understand the generality of, and variation in, mechanisms. We highlight plasticity of thermoregulation and underlying endocrine regulation, because thorough understanding of plasticity is key to predicting responses to changing environmental conditions. To this end, we discuss how changing climate is likely to affect avian thermoregulation and associated endocrine traits, and how the interplay between these physiological processes may play a role in facilitating or constraining adaptation to a changing climate. We conclude that while the general patterns of endocrine regulation of thermogenesis are quite well understood, at least in poultry, the molecular and endocrine mechanisms that regulate, e.g. mitochondrial function and plasticity of thermoregulation over different time scales (from transgenerational to daily variation), need to be unveiled. Plasticity may ameliorate climate change effects on thermoregulation to some extent, but the increased frequency of extreme weather events, and associated changes in resource availability, may be beyond the scope and/or speed for plastic responses. This could lead to selection for more tolerant phenotypes, if the underlying physiological traits harbour genetic and individual variation for selection to act on – a key question for future research.},

Recently it was shown that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be degraded in a saltwater-based environment using bacterial PETase produced by a marine diatom. At moderate temperatures, plastic biodegradation is slow and requires sensitive methods for detection, at least at initial stages. However, conventional methods for verifying the plastic degradation are either complex, expensive, time-consuming or they interfere with the degradation process. Here, we adapt lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) as a new application for efficiently monitoring enzymatic degradation of a PET glycol copolymer (PETG).

In this study, soil samples were collected from different plastic landfills in Iran and subsequently enriched in specific media (polyethylene as carbon source) to increase the population of LDPE-degrading bacteria. Seventeen PE-degrading bacteria, some novel, were isolated from Iranian soil samples and identified using 16S rDNA gene sequencing. These isolates were capable of degrading PE in a limited incubation period without the need for physicochemical pretreatments and comprise mostly of Actinobacteria which include the three genera of Streptomyces, Nocardia, and Rhodococcus. The isolates belonged to 17 different species of gram-positive Actinobacteria. In all, 11 species of the genus Streptomyces, 3 species of the genus Rhodococcus, and 3 species of the genus Nocardia were identified. The isolates with less than 99% 16S rRNA gene similarity to previously known species were suspected to be new species. Various analyses (weight loss, SEM, FTIR, and tensile strength test) to determine polyethylene biodegradation rate were carried out after a 60-day incubation period. Analysis of polyethylene biodegradation elucidates that Actinobacteria have a high ability for biodegradation of polyethylene-based plastics. Streptomyces sp. IR-SGS-T10 showed the highest reduction in weight of the LDPE film (1.58 mg/g/day) after 60 days of incubation without any pretreatments. Rhodococcus sp.

Digestion kinetics experiments on 24 snails showed that MFs can be ingested and excreted within 48 h. We found the appearance of cracks and deterioration on the surface of MFs after depuration by the digestive system. Prolonged exposure to 40 snails showed that 0.14–0.71 g kg−1 MFs caused an average reduction of 24.7–34.9% food intake and 46.6–69.7% excretion. 0.71 g kg−1 MFs induced significant villi damage in the gastrointestinal walls of 40% snails, but did not influence the histology of the liver and kidney. Moreover, 0.71 g kg−1 MFs exposure reduced glutathione peroxidase (59.3 ± 13.8%) and total antioxidant capacity (36.7 ± 8.5%), but elevated malondialdehyde level (58.0 ± 6.4%) in the liver, which indicates oxidative stress is involved in the toxic mechanism.

Here, we show that both positively and negatively charged nanoplastics can accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana. The aggregation promoted by the growth medium and root exudates limited the uptake of amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics with positive surface charges. Thus, positively charged nanoplastics accumulated at relatively low levels in the root tips, but these nanoplastics induced a higher accumulation of reactive oxygen species and inhibited plant growth and seedling development more strongly than negatively charged sulfonic-acid-modified nanoplastics. By contrast, the negatively charged nanoplastics were observed frequently in the apoplast and xylem. Our findings provide direct evidence that nanoplastics can accumulate in plants, depending on their surface charge. Plant accumulation of nanoplastics can have both direct ecological effects and implications for agricultural sustainability and food safety.},

abstract = {Marine and land plastic debris biodegrades at micro- and nanoscales through progressive fragmentation. Oceanographic model studies confirm the presence of up to ∼2.41 million tons of microplastics across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian subtropical gyres. Microplastics distribute from primary (e.g., exfoliating cleansers) and secondary (e.g., chemical deterioration) sources in the environment. This anthropogenic phenomenon poses a threat to the flora and fauna of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems as ingestion and entanglement cases increase over time. This review focuses on the impact of microplastics across taxa at suggested environmentally relevant concentrations, and advances the groundwork for future ecotoxicological-based research on microplastics including the main points: (i) adhesion of chemical pollutants (e.g., PCBs); (ii) biological effects (e.g., bioaccumulation, biomagnification, biotransportation) in terrestrial and aquatic organisms; (iii) physico-chemical properties (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and biodegradation pathways in the environment (e.g., chemical stress, heat stress); and (iv) an ecotoxicological prospect for optimized impact assessments.},

abstract = {Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of microbially made polyesters commercialized as biodegradable plastics. PHA production rates are predicted to increase as concerns around environmental plastic contamination and limited fossil fuel resources have increased the importance of biodegradable and bio-based plastic alternatives. Microbially produced PHA depolymerases are the key enzymes mediating PHA biodegradation, but only a few PHA depolymerases have been well-characterized and screens employing metagenomic sequence data are lacking. Here, we used 3078 metagenomes to analyse the distribution of PHA depolymerases in microbial communities from diverse aquatic, terrestrial and waste management systems. We significantly expand the recognized diversity of this protein family by screening 1914 Gb of sequence data and identifying 13 869 putative PHA depolymerases in 1295 metagenomes. Our results indicate that PHA depolymerases are unevenly distributed across environments. We predicted the highest frequency of PHA depolymerases in wastewater systems and the lowest in marine and thermal springs. In tandem, we screened 5290 metagenome-assembled genomes to describe the phylogenetic distribution of PHA depolymerases, which is substantially broader compared with current cultured representatives. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota are key lineages encoding PHA depolymerases, but PHA depolymerases were predicted from members of the Bdellovibrionota, Methylomirabilota, Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, Spirochaetota, Desulfobacterota, Myxococcota and Planctomycetota.},

abstract = {The environmental impact of exposure to 3D-printed plastics as well as potential migration of toxic chemicals from 3D-printed plastics remains largely unexplored. In this work we applied leachates from plastics fabricated using a stereolithography (SLA) process to early developmental stages of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to investigate developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity. Migration of unpolymerized photoinitiator, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (1−HCHPK) from a plastic solid phase to aqueous media at up to 200 mg/L in the first 24 h was detected using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Both plastic extracts (LC50 22.25% v/v) and 1−HCHPK (LC50 60 mg/L) induced mortality and teratogenicity within 48 h of exposure. Developmental toxicity correlated with in situ generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation markers and enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in embryos exposed to concentrations as low as 20% v/v for plastic extracts and 16 mg/L for 1−HCHPK. ROS-induced cellular damage led to induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis which could be pharmacologically inhibited with both antioxidant ascorbic acid and a pan-caspase inhibitor. Neuro-behavioral analysis showed that exposure to plastic leachates reduced spontaneous embryonic movement in 24–36 hpf embryos. Plastic extracts in concentrations above 20% v/v induced rapid retardation of locomotion, changes in photomotor response and habituation to photic stimuli with progressive paralysis in 120 hpf larvae. Significantly decreased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity with lack of any CNS-specific apoptotic phenotypes as well as lack of changes in motor neuron density, axonal growth, muscle segment integrity or presence of myoseptal defects were detected upon exposure to plastic extracts during embryogenesis. Considering implications of the results for environmental risk assessment and the growing usage of 3D-printing technologies, we speculate that some 3D-printed plastic waste may represent a significant and yet very poorly uncharacterized environmental hazard that merits further investigation on a range of aquatic and terrestrial species.},

abstract = {As one type of the most widespread and long-lasting anthropogenic contaminants, microplastics have become a global environmental concern. While numerous studies have demonstrated effects of microplastics on aquatic organisms, the potential influence on terrestrial faunas is relatively less known, even though soil is a primary recipient and sink of plastics. In this study, earthworm Eisenia fetida was exposed to different levels (0, 1, 5, 10, and 20% d.w.) of polyethylene (PE, ≤300 $\mu$m) and polystyrene (PS, ≤250 $\mu$m) particles in an agricultural soil to evaluate the oxidative stress. Fluorescence imaging, after dying with Nile Red, clearly indicated the ingestion of PE and PS particles by E. fetida. Exposure to PE or PS particles at the highest rate (20%) for 14 d significantly (p < 0.05) increased the activity of catalase and peroxidase and the level of lipid peroxidation, while inhibited the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase in E. fetida. However, no discernible effect was detected at amendment rates ≤10% for the majority of biochemical endpoints, suggesting that microplastic-induced oxidative stress would not occur in E. fetida under most environmental conditions. The influence of microplastics on bioaccumulation of PAHs and PCBs was also evaluated in E. fetida exposed to different levels (0, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10% d.w.) of PE and PS particles. The tissue concentrations of PAHs and PCBs were reduced in the presence of microplastics at amendment rates ≥1%, suggesting that microplastics did not act as a carrier to enhance contaminant uptake. This was attributed to competitive sorption of microplastics for contaminants and the specific feeding behavior of earthworm. Biodynamic model analysis confirmed that ingestion of microplastics contributed negligibly to contaminant bioaccumulation. Findings of this study suggested that under environmentally relevant conditions, microplastics should not cause significant toxic effects to E. fetida, nor enhance its accumulation of hydrophobic contaminants. PE and PS microplastics did not cause significant toxic effects to E. fetida, nor enhance its uptake of hydrophobic organic contaminants under environmentally relevant conditions.},

A systematic review of the literature was thus conducted to promote the research on MPs in the environment. This work is designed to provide a comprehensive overview that summarizes current knowledge and research findings on environmental occurrences, fate and transport, and impacts of MPs. In addition to discussing the occurrences, characteristics, and sources of MPs in the ocean, freshwater, sediments, soils, and atmosphere, the review also summarizes both the experimental and modeling data of the environmental fate and transport of MPs. Research findings on the toxic effects, bioaccumulation, and bioavailability of MPs in the environment are also covered in this critical review. Future perspectives are discussed as well.},

In this experiment, we investigated the impact of polystyrene microplastics (micro-PS) on the reproductive system of male mice. Healthy Balb/c mice were exposed to saline or to different doses of micro-PS for 6 weeks. The results showed that micro-PS exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the number and motility of sperm, and a significant increase in sperm deformity rate. We also detected a decrease in the activity of the sperm metabolism-related enzymes, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and a decrease in the serum testosterone content in the micro-PS exposure group. We found that micro-PS exposure caused oxidative stress and activated JNK and p38 MAPK. In addition, we found that when N-acetylcysteine (NAC) scavenges ROS, and when the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 inhibits p38MAPK, the micro-PS-induced sperm damage is alleviated and testosterone secretion improves. In conclusion, our findings suggest that micro-PS induces reproductive toxicity in mice through oxidative stress and activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathways.},

Isoetes L. is one of the earliest basal vascular plants and CAM is popular in this genus. Isoetes sinensis Palmer is an amphibious species, alternating frequently between terrestrial and aquatic environments. Given this, we investigated and compared photosynthetic characteristics over a diurnal cycle under submerged condition (SC) and terrestrial condition (TC). The results suggest that I. sinensis possesses a stronger CAM capacity under SC. Compared with under TC, titratable acidity levels and organic acid concentrations were more enriched under SC, whereas soluble sugar or starch and protein levels were lower under SC. Transcript analyses for nine photosynthetic genes revealed that CAM-associated genes possessed high transcripts under SC, but C3-related transcripts were highly expressed under TC. In addition, the enzyme activity measurements demonstrated that PEPC activity over a diurnal cycle was slightly higher under SC, whereas Rubisco activity during the daytime was greater under TC. This comprehensive study probably facilitates general understandings about the CAM photosynthetic characteristics of Isoetes in response to the environmental changes.},

abstract = {While a large body of literature has shown that microplastics (MPs) are highly likely to be accumulated in marine organisms and terrestrial animals, information about toxicity of MPs in mammal from a mechanistic point of view is more limited. Our paper fills this knowledge gap by assessing polystyrene (PS)-MPs-mice system based on toxicity-based toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic (TBTK/TD) modeling to quantify organ-bioaccumulation and biomarker responses appraised with published dataset. The key TBTK-parameters for mice liver, kidney, and gut posed by 5 or 20 $\mu$m PS-MPs could be obtained. We found that gut had the highest bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of ∼8 exposed to 5 $\mu$m PS-MPs with a mean residence time of ∼17 days. We showed that threshold concentrations of 5 and 20 $\mu$m PS-MPs among the most sensitive biomarkers were 8 ± 5 (mean ± SE) and 0.71 ± 0.14 $\mu$g g−1 bw, respectively, implicating that particle size was likely to affect TK/TD behavior in mice. The mice-based TK parameters and threshold criteria greatly assist in designing robust researches to evaluate MP consumption by humans. We establish a TBTK/TD framework for mechanistically assessing potential from mice size-specific MPs exposure that would offer a tool-kit for extrapolating to humans from health risk assessment perspective.},

abstract = {Terrestrial ecosystems are widely contaminated by microplastics due to extensive usage and poor handling of plastic materials, but the subsequent fate and remediate strategy of these pollutants are far from fully understood. In soil environments, microplastics pose a potential threat to the survival, growth, and reproduction of soil microbiota that in turn threaten the biodiversity, function, and services of terrestrial ecosystems. Meanwhile, microorganisms are sensitive to microplastics due to the adaptability to changes in substrates and soil properties. Through the metabolic and mineralization processes, microorganisms are also crucial participator to the plastic biodegradation. In this review, we present current knowledges and research results of interactions between microplastics and microorganisms (both fungi and bacteria) in soil environments and mainly discuss the following: (1) effects of microplastics on microbial habitats via changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties; (2) effects of microplastics on soil microbial communities and functions; and (3) soil microbial-mediated plastic degradation with the likely mechanisms and potential remediation strategies. We aim to analyze the mechanisms driving these interactions and subsequent ecological effects, propose future directives for the study of microplastic in soils, and provide valuable information on the plastic bioremediation in contaminated soils.},

In contrast, few data are available on terrestrial plants, especially on the mechanisms for transport of NPs in plants and phytotoxicity (at both phenotypic and molecular levels) of plants induced by NPs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a microcosm study in which hydroponically-cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were exposed to polystyrene (PS)-NPs at 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg L−1 for 16 d and examined for morphological and physiological phenotypes and transcriptomics. Laser confocal scanning micrographs confirmed PS-NPs were uptaken by rice roots, greatly benefitted from the transport activity of aquaporin in rice roots. The significant enhancement (p < 0.05) of antioxidant enzyme activities reflected the oxidative stress response of rice roots upon exposure to PS-NPs. Treatment by PS-NPs decreased root length and increased lateral root numbers. Carbon metabolism was activated (e.g., increased carbon and soluble sugar contents) whereas jasmonic acid and lignin biosynthesis were inhibited. The present study demonstrated the likelihood for transport of PS-NPs in rice roots and induced phytotoxicity by PS-NPs, which should inspire further investigations into the potential human health risks from rice consumption.},

However, comparatively little is known about the negative effects of MPs, co-contamination of MPs and heavy metals on terrestrial organisms. The objective of this study was performed to understand the adverse effects of exposure to MPs and co-exposure to MPs and cadmium (Cd) on the earthworm Eisenia foetida (E. foetida). Results showed that exposure to MPs only or to a combination of MPs + Cd decreased growth rate and increased the mortality (>300 mg kg−1) after exposure for 42 d, with MPs + Cd (>3000 mg kg−1) posing higher negative influence on the growth of E. foetida. Exposure to MPs might induce oxidative damage in E. foetida, and the presence of Cd accelerates the adverse effects of MPs. Furthermore, the MPs particles can be retained within E. foetida, with values of 4.3–67.2 particles{\textperiodcentered}g-1 earthworm, and can increase the accumulation of Cd in earthworm from 9.7%–161.3%. Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that combined exposure to MPs and Cd poses higher negative effects on E. foetida, and that MPs have the potential to increase the bioaccessibility of heavy metal ions in the soil environment.},

abstract = {Plants associate with a wide range of beneficial fungi in their roots which facilitate plant mineral nutrient uptake in exchange for carbohydrates and other organic metabolites. These associations play a key role in shaping terrestrial ecosystems and are widely believed to have promoted the evolution of land plants. To establish compatibility with their host, root-associated fungi have evolved diverse colonization strategies with distinct morphological, functional and genomic specializations as well as different degrees of interdependence. They include obligate biotrophic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), and facultative biotrophic ectomycorrhizal (ECM) interactions but are not restricted to these well-characterized symbioses. There is growing evidence that root endophytic associations, which due to their inconspicuous nature have been often overlooked, can be of mutualistic nature and represent important players in natural and managed environments. Recent research into the biology and genomics of root associations revealed fascinating insight into the phenotypic and trophic plasticity of these fungi and underlined genomic traits associated with biotrophy and saprotrophy. In this review we will consider the commonalities and differences of AM and ECM associations and contrast them with root endophytes. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},
