We characterised a collection of 14 spontaneous phenotype variants, derived from in vitro and in vivo cultures (wheat roots) of Pseudomonas corrugata 2140, using fatty acid methyl ester profiles (GC-FAME), carbon substrate utilisation (BIOLOG), and in vitro inhibition against seven soil microorganisms. All three phenotype profiles indicated marked differences between some variants and the parent isolate. Some variant types were classified taxonomically by GC-FAME as different species to their wild-type parent, and up to a Euclidian distance of 11 from their parent. Taxonomic identification by the BIOLOG assay was more consistent; however, use of 22 carbon sources were altered (lost or gained) in one or more variants. All variant types had a reduced ability to inhibit one or more test organisms, depending on the variant and test organism. Hierarchical cluster analysis of variants using GC-FAME, BIOLOG, and inhibition profiles produced different groupings.

Only approx. 1 g of PAE per ton of dry waste was leached. However, the elution of hydrophobic DEHP by the leachate is dependent on the composition of the waste which gave rise to different concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. Because of the experimental setup the amounts of leached PAE represent minimum levels of possible environmental contamination.

The slow rate of degradation of phenanthrene in dibutyl phthalate was increased by addition of phenanthrene-degrading microorganisms to soil slurries containing the NAPL. The rate was further increased and the acclimation phase was shortened if the inoculum was grown in a medium containing the hydrocarbon and the phthalate before addition to the slurries. Composition of the growth medium only shortened the acclimation but had no effect on the rate. Vigorous agitation increased the rate and extent of mineralization of phenanthrene in dibutyl phthalate. The effect of temperature was affected by the presence and identity of the inoculum. Rapid and extensive mineralization of phenanthrene initially present in hexadecane and diesel oil were attained by use of intense agitation of the NAPL/soil slurry and inoculation with microorganisms grown in the presence of the NAPLs, but the influence of these variables was less with other NAPLs. Vigorous agitation and addition of an inoculum 24 h after introduction of a nonionic surfactant enhanced biodegradation of phenanthrene initially in 150 Bright stock oil and dibutyl phthalate.

@article{Chaudhry1991,
abstract = {In this review we discuss the degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons by microorganisms, emphasizing the physiological, biochemical, and genetic basis of the biodegradation of aliphatic, aromatic, and polycyclic compounds. Many environmentally important xenobiotics are halogenated, especially chlorinated. These compounds are manufactured and used as pesticides, plasticizers, paint and printing-ink components, adhesives, flame retardants, hydraulic and heat transfer fluids, refrigerants, solvents, additives for cutting oils, and textile auxiliaries. The hazardous chemicals enter the environment through production, commercial application, and waste. As a result of bioaccumulation in the food chain and groundwater contamination, they pose public health problems because many of them are toxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. Although synthetic chemicals are usually recalcitrant to biodegradation, microorganisms have evolved an extensive range of enzymes, pathways, and control mechanisms that are responsible for catabolism of a wide variety of such compounds. Thus, such biological degradation can be exploited to alleviate environmental pollution problems. The pathways by which a given compound is degraded are determined by the physical, chemical, and microbiological aspects of a particular environment. By understanding the genetic basis of catabolism of xenobiotics, it is possible to improve the efficacy of naturally occurring microorganisms or construct new microorganisms capable of degrading pollutants in soil and aquatic environments more efficiently. Recently a number of genes whose enzyme products have a broader substrate specificity for the degradation of aromatic compounds have been cloned and attempts have been made to construct gene cassettes or synthetic operons comprising these degradative genes. Such gene cassettes or operons can be transferred into suitable microbial hosts for extending and custom designing the pathways for rapid degradation of recalcitrant compounds. Recent developments in designing recombinant microorganisms and hybrid metabolic pathways are discussed.},

abstract = {Anaerobic microorganisms in municipal solid waste samples from laboratory-scale landfill reactors and a pilot-plant biogas digester were investigated with the aim of assessing their ability to transform four commercially used phthalic acid esters (PAEs) and phthalic acid (PA). The PAEs studied were diethyl phthalate (DEP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). No biological transformation of DEHP could be detected in any of the experiments. Together with waste samples from the simulated landfilling conditions, the PAEs (except DEHP) were hydrolytically transformed to their corresponding monoesters. These accumulated as end products, and in most cases they were not further degraded. During incubation with waste from the biogas digester, the PAEs (except DEHP) were completely degraded to methane and carbon dioxide. The influence of the landfill development phase on the transformations was investigated utilizing PA and DEP as model substances. We found that during both the intense and stable methanogenic (but not the acidogenic) phases, the microoganisms in the samples had the potential to transform PA. A shorter lag phase was observed for the PA transformation in the samples from the stable methanogenic phase as compared with earlier phases. This indicates an increased capacity to degrade PA during the aging phases of the municipal solid waste in landfills. No enhancement of the DEP transformation could be observed as conditions in the methanogenic landfill model changed over a year's time. The results indicate that microorganisms developing in a methanogenic landfill environment have a substantially lower potential to degrade PAEs compared with those developing in a biogas reactor.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to find means of enhancing the biodegradation of hydrophobic organic compounds in nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs). The effects of surfactants, identity of the NAPL and agitation was investigated. When present in NAPLs, phenanthrene, di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and biphenyl were mineralized slowly in soil. Addition of Triton X-100 or Alfonic 810-60 did not enhance the degradation of phenanthrene initially in hexadecane or dibutyl phthalate. Slurrying the soil increased the rate and extent of mineralization of phenanthrene initially in hexadecane but not in dibutyl phthalate. Addition of either of the two surfactants to the slurries did not promote the transformation. Triton X-100, Alfonic 810-60 and Tergitol 15-S-9 below their critical micelle concentrations increased the rate and sometimes the extent of mineralization in soil slurries of phenanthrene initially in 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane, but other surfactants were not stimulatory. Slurrying the soil promoted the initial mineralization of DEHP initially in dibutyl phthalate, and Alfonic 810-60 and Triton X-100 further stimulated the rate and extent of degradation in the slurries. Alfonic 810-60 increased the extent of mineralization in slurries of biphenyl in hexadecane but not in dibutyl phthalate, cyclohexane, kerosene or two oils. Little mineralization of biphenyl or DEHP initially in dibutyl phthalate occurred in soil slurries, but Tween 80, Tergitol 15-S-40 and Tergitol 15-S-9 increased the extent of mineralization. However, vigorous agitation of the slurries of soil acclimated to DEHP or the use of small volumes of the NAPL resulted in marked enhancement of the degradation. Thus, biodegradation of constituents of NAPLs in soil can be increased by the use of some surfactants, slurrying or intense agitation, but the effect will vary with the NAPL and the constituents. {\textcopyright} 1995, Springer-Verlag.

Substances with strong mutagenic activity in ozonated vanillin were water-soluble and were slightly extracted with benzene, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate.

abstract = {The environmental fate of a polyacrylamide thickening agent (PATA), formulated without and with a glyphosate-surfactant herbicide (GH), was examined under various environmental situations: formulation in surface water and ground water, volatility, and soil mobility. Environmental Fate of PATA in Surface Water and Ground Water: PATA was formulated at four concentrations in distilled-deionized water, three surface water samples, and two ground water samples, without and with a GH. Solutions were placed in glass bottles, covered with plastic wrap, and exposed to environmental (outdoor) conditions for 6 weeks. Acrylamide and ammonium concentration, pH, and bacterial and fungal populations were measured weekly. All solutions in this portion of the study had a homogeneous milky appearance but by the conclusions of the study were nearly transparent. The results of this study suggest that polyacrylamide can degrade to acrylamide under environmental conditions. Statistically, there was no linear correlation between the various parameters measured. Volatility: PATA was formulated without and with GH. Each solution plus an acrylamide standard (positive control) was placed in a glass beaker and exposed to environmental (outdoor) conditions for 6 days. Acrylamide concentration, ammonium concentration, pH, and solution volume were measured daily. Acrylamide and ammonium concentrations increased during the study in all formulations, except when solutions evaporated to dryness. pH did not change greatly over the course of the study for these samples.

Mites were collected from artificial dung pats exposed to natural colonization in the field for 16 days. The pats were composed of manure alone or manure separately mixed with waste-material particles of four types and concentrations. Mites were the numerically dominant taxon among arthropods in manure. The Prostigmata was the most abundant suborder, mainly represented by the families Pygmephoridae and Ereynetidae. The common families of Mesostigmata were all cosmopolitan. Correlations with other arthropods suggest that Mesostigmata are opportunistic predators, preying upon dipteran larvae, Collembola and other mites, and preyed upon by larger predatory insect larvae. Cryptostigmata and Astigmata were a numerically minor community component. The species composition and abundance upon treatment of manure with polyethylene, polystyrene and glass particles was similar to that of the treatment control, i.e. natural and inert sand. Relatively low concentrations, 5 and 30% (v/v), of particles in manure did not alter the mite communities despite important differences with untreated manure in final moisture content.

EPTC applied with metam sodium injured tomato plants and reduced total crop yield more than EPTC, pebulate, or pebulate with metam sodium.

Although trace gas budgets from soils obtained in this experiment are only one example, the results indicate that the budgets of trace gases, as well as CO2 and O2, change greatly with the degree of soil maturation and are dependent on the kind of substances in the soil. Both in the PMCC and in the CPCE, trace gases such as dioctyl phthalate (DOP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), toluene and xylene were detected. These gases seemed to be released from various materials used in the construction of these chambers. The degree of increase in these trace gas levels was dependent on the relationship between chamber capacity and plant quantity. Results of trace gas measurement in the PMCC, in which lettuce and shiitake mushroom were cultivated, showed that ethylene was released both from lettuce and from the mushroom culture bed. The release rates were about 90 ng bed−1 h−1 for the shiitake mushroom culture bed (volume is 1700 cm3) and 4.1 ∼ 17.3 ng dm−2h−1 (leaf area basis) for lettuce. Higher ethylene release rates per plant and per unit leaf area were observed in mature plants than in young plants. {\textcopyright} 1995, All rights reserved.},

@article{Tomy1998,
abstract = {Polychlorinated-n-alkanes (PCAs) or chlorinated paraffins consist of C 10 to C30 n-alkanes with chlorine content from 30% to 70% by mass. PCAs are used as high-temperature lubricants, plasticizers, flame retardants, and additives in adhesives, paints, rubber, and sealants. This review presents the existing data on the environmental chemistry and toxicology of PCAs and a preliminary exposure and risk assessment. There is limited information on the levels, fate, or biological effects of PCAs in the environment. This results both from the difficulty associated with quantifying PCAs, because of the complexity inherent to commercial formulations, and from the limited knowledge of their physicochemical properties and biodegradation rates. There are indications that PCAs are widespread environmental contaminants at ng/L levels in surface waters and ng/g (wet wt) levels in biota. However, environmental measurements of PCAs are very limited in the U.S. and Canada, and are only slightly more detailed in western Europe. Assuming that reported water concentrations are mainly caused by the short chain (C10-C 13) compounds, aquatic organisms may be at risk from exposure to PCAs. Fugacity level II modeling for two representative PCAs, using the best available physicochemical property data and estimated degradation rates, suggested that C16C24Cl10 would achieve higher concentrations in biota, sediment, and soil than C12H 20Cl6 because of slower degradation rates and lower water solubility. Environmental residence time of C16H24Cl 10 is estimated to be 520 d compared to 210 d for C 12H20Cl6. Future studies will require better analytical methods and reference materials certified for PCA content. Additional data are needed to evaluate exposure of biota to PCAs in the environment, particularly in light of their continued production and usage around the globe. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 1998.},

@article{Uchida2000,
abstract = {Various microorganisms were screened for their ability to degrade poly(tetramethylene succinate)-co-(tetramethylene adipate) (PBSA). Strain BS-3, which was newly isolated from a soil sample, was selected as the best strain. From taxonomical studies, the strain was tentatively ascribed to belong to the genus Acidovorax, most probably to the species A. delafieldii. Strain BS-3 could degrade both solid and emulsified PBSA, and also emulsified poly(tetramethylene succinate). During the degradation, a lipase activity was observed in the culture broth. This lipase activity was induced more strongly by PBSA than by tributyrin or triolein which are typical substrates of lipase. These observations strongly suggest that this lipase was involved in the PBSA biodegradation in strain BS-3. {\ss}},
