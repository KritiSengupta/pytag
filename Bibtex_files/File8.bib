abstract = {Cyanobacteria probably exhibit the widest range of diversity in growth habitats of all photosynthetic organisms. They are found in cold and hot, alkaline and acidic, marine, freshwater, saline, terrestrial, and symbiotic environments. In addition to this, they originated on earth at least 2.5 billion years ago and have evolved through periods of dramatic O2 increases, CO2 declines, and temperature changes. One of the key problems they have faced through evolution and in their current environments is the capture of CO2 and its efficient use by Rubisco in photosynthesis. A central response to this challenge has been the development of a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) that can be adapted to various environmental limitations. There are two primary functional elements of this CCM. Firstly, the containment of Rubisco in carboxysome protein microbodies within the cell (the sites of CO2 elevation), and, secondly, the presence of several inorganic carbon (Ci) transporters that deliver HCO3- intracellularly. Cyanobacteria show both species adaptation and acclimation of this mechanism. Between species, there are differences in the suites of Ci transporters in each genome, the nature of the carboxysome structures and the functional roles of carbonic anhydrases. Within a species, different CCM activities can be induced depending on the Ci availability in the environment. This acclimation is largely based on the induction of multiple Ci transporters with different affinities and specificities for either CO2 or HCO3- as substrates. These features are discussed in relation to our current knowledge of the genomic sequences of a diverse array of cyanobacteria and their ecological environments.},

abstract = {This review is designed to evaluate and interpret studies relevant to the locomotory mode known as brachiation, particularly as performed by the Hylobatid apes: the gibbon and siamang species. The older literature and its conclusions are evaluated against recent work performed by the author and other research groups working on brachiation models, either computer simulations or physical robots. The gibbon displays two types of brachiation: continuous contact, analogous to walking, and ricochetal, analogous to running. Both brachiation gaits display substantial pendular exchange between kinetic and potential energy. However, the fundamental feature of either of these gaits is the minimization of collisional energy loss. Collisional energy loss due to discontinuities in the trajectory of the center of mass is emerging as key in understanding locomotion using limbs in any terrestrial environment. The insight gained from this perspective applied to gibbon locomotion demonstrates that this is a critical factor in understanding many of the maneuvers employed by these animals, and can provide novel new interpretations of the morphological specializations that characterize the group. It is observed that these animals could brachiate using either totally active (muscle powered) or totally passive (nonmuscular) mechanisms. The active option would be metabolically costly, but provides substantial motion plasticity, while the passive option has the potential for profound economy, but does not allow a means to effectively contend with the inconsistencies present in the animal's natural environment. The conclusion is that the body form of brachiators and the locomotion behaviors they exhibit are a compromise between these two extremes, and these features of the gibbon's biology can only be understood by recognizing the role of collisional energy loss and evaluating both passive and active motion options together.},

Long Evans rats were conceived, born and reared (CBR) continuously in hypergravity conditions until the age of 100 days. Whole muscle morphological parameters, Ca2+ activation characteristics from single skinned fibers, troponin (Tn) subunit and myosin heavy (MHC) and light (MLC) chains isoform compositions were examined in CBR and control muscles from age-paired terrestrial rats. Decreases in body and muscle mass in soleus and plantaris muscles were observed and associated, in the soleus, with a decrease in fiber diameter. The specific force of CBR soleus fibers was increased, and correlated with the elevation of Ca2+ affinity. This was accompanied by slow-to-slower TnC and TnI isoform transitions and a rearrangement in TnT fast isoform content. The MHC transformations of the soleus after hypergravity were associated with the up (down)-regulation of the MHCI (MHCIIa) mRNA isoforms. The MLC2 phosphorylation state remained unchanged in the soleus muscle. The results suggested that the gravity factor could interact with rat muscle development and that hypergravity experiments could provide good tools for the study of myofibrillar protein plasticity and their associated pathways of regulation.},

abstract = {Although caspase activity in the nervous system of mollusks has not been described before, we suggested that these cysteine proteases might be involved in the phenomena of neuroplasticity in mollusks. We directly measured caspase-3 (DEVDase) activity in the Helix lucorum central nervous system (CNS) using a fluorometrical approach and showed that the caspase-3-like immunoreactivity is present in the central neurons of Helix. Western blots revealed the presence of caspase-3-immunoreactive proteins with a molecular mass of 29 kDa. Staurosporin application, routinely used to induce apoptosis in mammalian neurons through the activating cleavage of caspase-3, did not result in the appearance of a smaller subunit corresponding to the active caspase in the snail. However, it did increase the enzyme activity in the snail CNS. This suggests differences in the regulation of caspase-3 activity in mammals and snails. In the snail CNS, the caspase homolog seems to possess an active center without activating cleavage typical for mammals. In electrophysiological experiments with identified snail neurons, selective blockade of the caspase-3 with the irreversible and cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase-3 N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val- Asp-(OMe)-fluoro-methylketone prevented development of the long-term stage of synaptic input sensitization, suggesting that caspase is necessary for normal synaptic plasticity in snails. The results of our study give the first direct evidence that the caspase-3-like activity is essential for long-term plasticity in the invertebrate neurons.

As brain tissue is metabolically and nutritionally costly to develop and maintain, early hominin encephalization has been linked to a release of energetic and nutritional constraints. One such nutrient-based approach has focused on the n-3 long-chained polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is a primary constituent of membrane phospholipids within the synaptic networks of the brain essential for optimal cognitive functioning. As biosynthesis of DHA from n-3 dietary precursors (alpha-linolenic acid, LNA) is relatively inefficient, it has been suggested that preformed DHA must have been an integral dietary constituent during evolution of the genus Homo to facilitate the growth and development of an encephalizing brain. Furthermore, preformed DHA has only been identified to an appreciable extent within aquatic resources (marine and freshwater), leading to speculation that hominin encephalization is linked specifically to access and consumption of aquatic resources. The key premise of this perspective is that biosynthesis of DHA from LNA is not only inefficient but also insufficient for the growth and maturation demands of an encephalized brain. However, this assumption is not well-supported, and much evidence instead suggests that consumption of LNA, available in a wider variety of sources within a number of terrestrial ecosystems, is sufficient for normal brain development and maintenance in modern humans and presumably our ancestors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To better understand the processes of UV-B acclimation that result in altered plant morphology and physiology, we investigated gene expression in different organs of maize at several UV-B fluence rates and exposure times. RESULTS: Microarray hybridization was used to assess UV-B responses in directly exposed maize organs and organs shielded by a plastic that absorbs UV-B. After 8 hours of high UV-B, the abundance of 347 transcripts was altered: 285 were increased significantly in at least one organ and 80 were downregulated. More transcript changes occurred in directly exposed than in shielded organs, and the levels of more transcripts were changed in adult compared to seedling tissues. The time course of transcript abundance changes indicated that the response kinetics to UV-B is very rapid, as some transcript levels were altered within 1 hour of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the UV-B regulated genes are organ-specific. Because shielded tissues, including roots, immature ears, and leaves, displayed altered transcriptome profiles after exposure of the plant to UV-B, some signal(s) must be transmitted from irradiated to shielded tissues. These results indicate that there are integrated responses to UV-B radiation above normal levels. As the same total UV-B irradiation dose applied at three intensities elicited different transcript profiles, the transcriptome changes exhibit threshold effects rather than a reciprocal dose-effect response.

The global change-type drought characteristic of many temperate terrestrial ecosystems is especially significant because it will apparently favour invasive over indigenous species, adding to the burden of conservation and compromising ecosystem service delivery. However, the nature of and mechanisms underlying this synergy remain poorly explored. Here we show that in a temperate terrestrial ecosystem, invasive and indigenous springtail species differ in the form of their phenotypic plasticity such that warmer conditions promote survival of desiccation in the invasive species and reduce it in the indigenous ones. These differences are consistent with significant declines in the densities of indigenous species and little change in those of invasive species in a manipulative field experiment that mimicked climate change trends. We suggest that it is not so much the extent of phenotypic plasticity that distinguishes climate change responses among these invasive and indigenous species, as the form that this plasticity takes. Nonetheless, this differential physiological response provides support for the idea that in temperate terrestrial systems experiencing global change-type drought, invasive species may well be at an advantage relative to their indigenous counterparts. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

These differences are consistent with significant declines in the densities of indigenous species and little change in those of invasive species in a manipulative field experiment that mimicked climate change trends. We suggest that it is not so much the extent of phenotypic plasticity that distinguishes climate change responses among these invasive and indigenous species, as the form that this plasticity takes. Nonetheless, this differential physiological response provides support for the idea that in temperate terrestrial systems experiencing global change-type drought, invasive species may well be at an advantage relative to their indigenous counterparts.},

abstract = {Temperature dependence, energetics, and speed of locomotion have important implications for the ecology and evolution of ants. Here, we report the results of a full-factorial study investigating the responses of active metabolic rate (AMR), voluntary locomotion speed, and cost of transport (COT) to three temperature acclimations (7-10 d; 20°, 25°, and 30°C) and three test temperature treatments (2 h; 20°, 25°, and 30°C) in a seed-harvester ant, Messor capensis. By using a strong-inference approach, we assessed these trait responses in the context of the beneficial acclimation hypothesis and its alternatives. Results showed that AMR was not affected by acclimation temperature, indicating limited phenotypic plasticity for this trait. By contrast, voluntary running speed was consistently higher when ants were acclimated at 25°C, providing support for the optimal acclimation hypothesis. COT was not affected by acclimation or treatment temperature. In addition, while AMR was re-peatable and similar across temperatures (r = 0.371-0.683), the repeatabilities of running speed (r = 0.191-0.826) and COT (r = 0.166-0.903) were highly variable, suggesting constraints on ant locomotion under certain thermal conditions. Minimum COT (298 J kg-1 m -1) in M. capensis was well within the range of values for other terrestrial arthropods of a similar body size. This study emphasizes the need to investigate a variety of performance traits rather than a single one and to expand the limited body of work on plasticity of insect locomotion. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Skin is an important avenue of water loss in terrestrial birds, so environmental conditions that necessitate water conservation should favor physiological mechanisms that reduce cutaneous water loss (CWL). Skin resistance to CWL is conferred by a barrier of lipid molecules located in the stratum corneum (SC), the outer layer of the epidermis. In mammals, SC barrier function depends on the conversion of cerebrosides to ceramides by the enzyme $\beta$-glucocerebrosidase ($\beta$-GlcCer'ase). Avian SC contains both cerebrosides and ceramides, suggesting that observed plasticity in CWL may be mediated by changes in $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity and resultant SC lipid composition. We tested the hypothesis that changes in ambient humidity would alter $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity by acclimating house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to either dry (6.5 g H2O m-3 absolute humidity) or humid (31 g H2O m-3) conditions for 5 and 21 d at 30°C and then measuring $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity from SC homogenates. Our results provide the first characterization of $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity in any nonmammalian vertebrate. Relative to nonacclimated controls, both dry- and humid-acclimated sparrows had significantly elevated $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity at 21 d postacclimation. Across individuals, we observed negative correlations between $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity and both CWL and SC ceramide content. Although dry- and humid-acclimated sparrows did not differ in $\beta$-GlcCer'ase activity, these results are consistent with our findings that both humidity treatments caused a reduction in CWL and similar changes in SC lipid composition. Our results demonstrate physiological plasticity in CWL and provide tentative support for a role of $\beta$-GlcCer'ase in mediating this response. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The University of Chicago.

However, little is known about their effects in reptiles that have independently evolved viviparity. We investigated whether exogenous corticosterone affected embryonic development in the viviparous gecko Hoplodactylus maculatus, and whether pregnant geckos have a corticosterone response to capture and confinement that is suppressed relative to that in non-pregnant (vitellogenic) females and males. Corticosterone implants (5 mg, slow-release) administered to females in mid-pregnancy caused a large elevation of corticosterone in maternal plasma (P<0.001), probable reductions in embryonic growth and development (P=0.069-0.073), developmental abnormalities and eventual abortions. Cool temperature produced similar reductions in embryonic growth and development (P≤0.036 cf. warm controls), but pregnancies were eventually successful. Despite the potentially harmful effects of elevated plasma corticosterone, pregnant females did not suppress their corticosterone response to capture and confinement relative to vitellogenic females, and both groups of females had higher responses than males. Future research should address whether lower maternal doses of corticosterone produce non-lethal effects on development that could contribute to phenotypic plasticity. Corticosterone implants also led to increased basking in pregnant females (P<0.001), and basal corticosterone in wild geckos (independent of reproductive condition) was positively correlated with body temperature (P<0.001). Interactions between temperature and corticosterone may have broad significance to other terrestrial ectotherms, and body temperature should be considered as a variable influencing plasma corticosterone concentrations in all future studies on reptiles. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The human exposure estimates for dibutyl (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) made by two models EUSES and ACC-Human, and by an estimation approach which utilized measured concentrations in exposure media, were compared. The approach which utilized the latest monitoring data for important exposure media, yielded median daily intakes for adult humans for DBP and DEHP of 2.7 and 5.6 $\mu$g/kg body weight per day, respectively, which were in the same range as previous estimates based on back-calculation from urinary metabolites. EUSES estimated average daily intakes of DBP and DEHP for humans that were between 8 and 13 times lower. ACC-Human does not estimate average daily intakes, but ACC-Human-estimated human milk concentrations/fugacities were more than a thousand times lower than measured concentrations/fugacities in human milk. It was concluded that the two models underestimate human exposure to phthalate esters because they consider only a few key pathways that are known to be important for other, more persistent, hydrophobic organic compounds. Further, it was shown that there are differences between the two models on the methodology for estimating concentrations in exposure media such as vegetation, milk, beef and fish. ACC-Human uses a mechanistic approach for estimating transfer through aquatic and terrestrial food chains that are known to be important for human exposure to persistent, hydrophobic organics and can, unlike EUSES, account for food chain metabolism. It proved difficult, however, to obtain organism metabolism rates needed as model inputs to ACC-Human. If exposure estimates of phthalate esters are needed, it is recommended to use an estimation approach based on high quality monitoring data as presented here and/or back-calculate daily intake from concentrations of metabolites in human urine samples from the general population. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The human exposure estimates for dibutyl (DBP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) made by two models EUSES and ACC-Human, and by an estimation approach which utilized measured concentrations in exposure media, were compared. The approach which utilized the latest monitoring data for important exposure media, yielded median daily intakes for adult humans for DBP and DEHP of 2.7 and 5.6 $\mu$g/kg body weight per day, respectively, which were in the same range as previous estimates based on back-calculation from urinary metabolites. EUSES estimated average daily intakes of DBP and DEHP for humans that were between 8 and 13 times lower. ACC-Human does not estimate average daily intakes, but ACC-Human-estimated human milk concentrations/fugacities were more than a thousand times lower than measured concentrations/fugacities in human milk. It was concluded that the two models underestimate human exposure to phthalate esters because they consider only a few key pathways that are known to be important for other, more persistent, hydrophobic organic compounds. Further, it was shown that there are differences between the two models on the methodology for estimating concentrations in exposure media such as vegetation, milk, beef and fish. ACC-Human uses a mechanistic approach for estimating transfer through aquatic and terrestrial food chains that are known to be important for human exposure to persistent, hydrophobic organics and can, unlike EUSES, account for food chain metabolism. It proved difficult, however, to obtain organism metabolism rates needed as model inputs to ACC-Human. If exposure estimates of phthalate esters are needed, it is recommended to use an estimation approach based on high quality monitoring data as presented here and/or back-calculate daily intake from concentrations of metabolites in human urine samples from the general population. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study tested whether geographic variation in cell size and plasticity for cell size exist in a terrestrial, ectothermic vertebrate, Anolis carolinensis Voigt, 1832. We demonstrated temperature-induced plasticity in erythrocytes and epithelial cells of hatchlings lizards derived from the eggs of females sampled from four populations and incubated at multiple temperatures.

Therefore, temperature-induced plasticity applies at the cellular, but not organismal, level in A. carolinensis. In addition, reaction norms for cell size differed among populations. There was a latitudinal trend in cell size and in plasticity of cell size among our study populations. The two southernmost populations showed plasticity in cell size, whereas the two northernmost ones did not.

abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) cascade plays an important role in gene expression regulation during memory formation in both vertebrates and invertebrates. MAPK/ERK regulates gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors binding to the regulatory elements SRE and CRE of target genes. Previously we reported that juvenile snails Helix lucorum differ from adult animals in a spectrum of transcription factors binding to DNA regulatory elements SRE and AP-1. In this study we analyzed the expression and activation of MAPK/ERK in CNS of H. lucorum during formation of the conditioned avoidance reflex at different stages of postnatal ontogenesis. Under conditions of learning, juvenile snails (aged 2-3 months) possessing immature mechanisms of avoidance reflex plasticity showed dramatically low level of phosphorylation and, correspondingly, low activation of MAPK/ERK in comparison to adult animals. Beside this, the MAPK/ERK cascade was not activated after 10 and 60 min after learning in juvenile snails in contrast to adults, while basal expression level of this kinase was similar in juveniles and adults. Low activation of MAPK/ERK cascade can cause a deficiency in phosphorylation of downstream transcription factors binding to SRE and thereby influence the expression of early response genes (particularly, of the family AP-1) and late response genes necessary for cellular and synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that the MAPK/ERK regulatory cascade plays an essential role in the formation of conditioned avoidance reflexes in Helix. Low activation of this cascade might be one of the reasons for deficiency of long-term memory formation during avoidance learning in juvenile animals. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {As a carbon-based life form living in a predominantly carbonbased environment, it is not surprising that we have created a carbon-based consumer society. Our principle sources of energy are carbon-based (coal, oil, and gas) and many of our consumer goods are derived from organic (i.e., carbon-based) chemicals (including plastics, fabrics and materials, personal care and cleaning products, dyes, and coatings). Even our large-volume inorganic-chemicals-based industries, including fertilizers and construction materials, rely on the consumption of carbon, notably in the form of large amounts of energy. The environmental problems which we now face and of which we are becoming increasingly aware result from a human-induced disturbance in the natural carbon cycle of the Earth caused by transferring large quantities of terrestrial carbon (coal, oil, and gas) to the atmosphere, mostly in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon is by no means the only element whose natural cycle we have disturbed: we are transferring significant quantities of elements including phosphorus, sulfur, copper, and platinum from natural sinks or ores built up over millions of years to unnatural fates in the form of what we refer to as waste or pollution. However, our complete dependence on the carbon cycle means that its disturbance deserves special attention, as is now manifest in indicators such as climate change and escalating public concern over global warming. As with all disturbances in materials balances, we can seek to alleviate the problem by (1) dematerialization: a reduction in consumption; (2) rematerialization: a change in what we consume; or (3) transmaterialization: changing our attitude towards resources and waste. The "low-carbon" mantra that is popularly cited by organizations ranging from nongovernmental organizations to multinational companies and from local authorities to national governments is based on a combination of (1) and (2) (reducing carbon consumption though greater efficiency and lower per capita consumption, and replacing fossil energy sources with sources such as wind, wave, and solar, respectively). "Low carbon" is of inherently less value to the chemical and plastics industries at least in terms of raw materials although a version of (2), the use of biomass, does apply, especially if we use carbon sources that are renewable on a human timescale. There is however, another renewable, natural source of carbon that is widely available and for which greater utilization would help restore material balance and the natural cycle for carbon in terms of resource and waste. CO2, perhaps the most widely discussed and feared chemical in modern society, is as fundamental to our survival as water, and like water we need to better understand the human as well as natural production and consumption of CO2 so that we can attempt to get these into a sustainable balance. Current utilization of this valuable resource by the chemical industry is only 90 megatonne per year, compared to the 26.3 gigatonne CO2 generated annually by combustion of fossil fuels for energy generation, as such significant opportunities exist for increased utilization of CO2 generated from industrial processes.

The Red-CDEF proteins constitute a novel signaling system in which four two-component proteins comprising a histidine kinase, a histidine-kinase like protein, and two response regulators function together to regulate progression through the elaborate developmental program of Myxococcus xanthus. A combination of in vivo phenotypic analyses of in-frame deletions and non-functional point mutations in each gene as well as in vitro autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer analyses of recombinant proteins indicate that the RedC histidine kinase protein autophosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to the single domain response regulator, RedF, to repress progression through the developmental program. To relieve this developmental repression, RedC instead phosphorylates RedD, a dual receiver response regulator protein. Surprisingly, RedD transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine kinase-like protein RedE, which itself appears to be incapable of autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of RedE may render RedE accessible to RedF, where it removes the phosphoryl group from RedF-P, which is otherwise an unusually stable phosphoprotein. These analyses reveal a novel "four-component" signaling mechanism that has probably arisen to temporally coordinate signals controlling the developmental program in M. xanthus.

abstract = {Seasonal cooling can modify the thermal preferenda of ectothermic vertebrates and elicit a variety of physiological responses ranging from winter dormancy to an acclimation response that partially compensates for the effects of low temperature on activity. Partial compensation of activity levels is particularly common in aquatic species for which seasonal temperature changes provide a stable cue for initiating the response. Thermal plasticity of locomotory performance has evolved independently on numerous occasions, and there is considerable phylogenetic diversity with respect to the mechanisms at the physiological and molecular levels. In teleosts, neuromuscular variables that can be modified include the duration of motor nerve stimulation, muscle activation and relaxation times, maximum force and unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax), although not all are modified in every species. Thermal plasticity in Vmax has been associated with changes in myosin ATPase activity and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) composition and/or with a change in the ratio of myosin light chain isoforms. In common carp (Cyprinus carpio), there are continuous changes in phenotype with acclimation temperature at lower levels of organisation, such as MyHC composition and Vmax, but a distinct threshold for an effect in terms of locomotory performance. Thus, there is no simple relationship between whole-animal performance and muscle phenotype. The nature and magnitude of temperature acclimation responses also vary during ontogeny. For example, common carp acquire the ability to modify MyHC composition with changes in acclimation temperature during the juvenile stage. In contrast, the thermal plasticity of swimming performance observed in tadpoles of the frog Limnodynastes peronii is lost in the terrestrial adult stage. Although it is often assumed that the adjustments in locomotory performance associated with temperature acclimation enhance fitness, this has rarely been tested experimentally. Truly integrative studies of temperature acclimation are scarce, and few studies have considered both sensory and motor function in evaluating behavioural responses. Developmental plasticity is a special case of a temperature acclimation response that can lead to temporary or permanent changes in morphology and/or physiological characteristics that affect locomotory performance.},

The results demonstrate that the specific binding sites for agonists to mammalian type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) exist in the snail's nervous system. Application of a synthetic cannabinoid agonist anandamide selectively changed the efficacy of synaptic contacts between the identified neurons. A decrease in the long-term synaptic facilitation of the synaptic contact elicited by high-frequency nerve tetanization in the presence of cannabinoid agonist anandamide was observed, suggesting a possible role of endocannabinoids in regulation of plasticity at this synaptic site.

Fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. Whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity of function. Amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum. Thus, effective lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external to the epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratin complex within the stratum corneum. Amphibians prevent desiccation of the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding the stratum corneum with superficial lipids. Water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have 'plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. While it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studies of the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. Fundamental mechanisms for adjusting the skin water barrier include changes in barrier thickness, composition and physicochemical properties of cutaneous lipids, and/or geometry of the barrier within the epidermis. While cutaneous lipids have been studied extensively in the contexts of disease and cosmetics, relatively little is known about the processes of permeability barrier ontogenesis related to adaptation and environment.

Maternal effects can act as a conduit by which the maternal environment negatively affects offspring fitness, but they can also buffer offspring from environmental change by altering the phenotype of offspring according to local environmental conditions and as such, are a form of transgenerational plasticity. The benefits of maternal effects can be highly context dependent, increasing performance in one life-history stage but reducing it in another.

Here, I examine the role of maternal effects across the life history of the bryozoan Bugula neritina.

I then examined the resistance of offspring to copper from toxicant-exposed and toxicant-na{\"{i}}ve mothers and found that offspring from toxicant-exposed mothers were larger, more dispersive, and more resistant to copper stress than offspring from na{\"{i}}ve mothers. However, maternal exposure history had pervasive, negative effects on the post-metamorphic performance (particularly survival) of offspring: offspring from toxicant-exposed mothers had poorer performance after six weeks in the field, especially when facing high levels of intraspecific competition. Maternal experience can have complex effects on offspring phenotype, enhancing performance in one life-history stage while decreasing performance in another.

abstract = {Survival and growth of terrestrial plants is negatively affected by complete submergence. This is mainly the result of hampered gas exchange between plants and their environment, since gas diffusion is severely reduced in water compared with air, resulting in O2 deficits which limit aerobic respiration. The continuation of photosynthesis could probably alleviate submergence-stress in terrestrial plants, but its potential under water will be limited as the availability of CO2 is hampered. Several submerged terrestrial plant species, however, express plastic responses of the shoot which may reduce gas diffusion resistance and enhance benefits from underwater photosynthesis. In particular, the plasticity of the flooding-tolerant terrestrial species Rumex palustris turned out to be remarkable, making it a model species suitable for the study of these responses. During submergence, the morphology and anatomy of newly developed leaves changed: 'aquatic' leaves were thinner and had thinner cuticles. As a consequence, internal O2 concentrations and underwater CO2 assimilation rates were higher at the prevailing low CO2 concentrations in water. Compared with heterophyllous amphibious plant species, underwater photosynthesis rates of terrestrial plants may be very limited, but the effects of underwater photosynthesis on underwater survival are impressive. A combination of recently published data allowed quantification of the magnitude of the acclimation response in this species. Gas diffusion resistance in terrestrial leaves underwater was about 15 000 times higher than in air. Strikingly, acclimation to submergence reduced this factor to 400, indicating that acclimated leaves of R. palustris had an approximately 40 times lower gas diffusion resistance than non-acclimated ones. {\textcopyright} The Author [2005].

The main problems during submergence are shortage of oxygen due to the slow diffusion rates of gases in water, and depletion of carbohydrates, which is the substrate for respiration. These two factors together lead to loss of biomass and eventually death of the submerged plants. Although conditions under water are unfavourable with respect to light and carbon dioxide supply, photosynthesis may provide both oxygen and carbohydrates, resulting in continuation of aerobic respiration. • Scope: This review focuses on evidence in the literature that photosynthesis contributes to survival of terrestrial plants during complete submergence. Furthermore, we discuss relevant morphological and physiological responses of the shoot of terrestrial plant species that enable the positive effects of light on underwater plant performance. • Conclusions: Light increases the survival of terrestrial plants under water, indicating that photosynthesis commonly occurs under these submerged conditions.

abstract = {Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is one of the photosynthetic pathways regarded as adaptations to water stress in land plants. Little is known about correlations among the level of CAM activity, environment of habitat, life form, and phylogenetic relationship of a plant group from an evolutionary perspective. We examined these relationships in 18 species of Cymbidium (Orchidaceae) because the genus shows distinctive diversification of habitats and life forms. The photosynthetic type was classed into three categories, strong CAM, weak CAM, and C3 on the basis of CAM activity. CAM expression in Cymbidium was confined to the epiphytic and lithophytic species. Especially, all of these species from tropical to subtropical rainforest exhibited CAM activity. On the other hand, the terrestrial species always exhibited C3 metabolism irrespective of their varied habitats.

abstract = {Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is one of the photosynthetic pathways regarded as adaptations to water stress in land plants. Little is known about correlations among the level of CAM activity, environment of habitat, life form, and phylogenetic relationship of a plant group from an evolutionary perspective. We examined these relationships in 18 species of Cymbidium (Orchidaceae) because the genus shows distinctive diversification of habitats and life forms. The photosynthetic type was classed into three categories, strong CAM, weak CAM, and C3 on the basis of CAM activity. CAM expression in Cymbidium was confined to the epiphytic and lithophytic species. Especially, all of these species from tropical to subtropical rainforest exhibited CAM activity. On the other hand, the terrestrial species always exhibited C3 metabolism irrespective of their varied habitats. Regarding the evolution of photosynthetic characters, weak CAM was the ancestral state in Cymbidium and strong CAM and C3 metabolism occurred subsequently. The evolution of strong CAM likely enabled Cymbidium to extend to exposed sites in tropical lowland where marked water stress exists. Further, different levels of CAM activity characterized each species and such potential plasticity of CAM may realize the radiation of Cymbidium into sites with different environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.},

Moreover, the paper provides novel data on the biological effects of some of these plasticizers in invertebrates, fish and amphibians. Phthalates and BPA have been shown to affect reproduction in all studied animal groups, to impair development in crustaceans and amphibians and to induce genetic aberrations.

Effect concentrations of plasticizers in laboratory experiments coincide with measured environmental concentrations, and thus there is a very real potential for effects of these chemicals on some wildlife populations. The most striking gaps in our current knowledge on the impacts of plasticizers on wildlife are the lack of data for long-term exposures to environmentally relevant concentrations and their ecotoxicity when part of complex mixtures.

We tested the hypothesis that gill structure is plastic and that metabolic rate is maintained in response to air exposure. During air exposure, when gills are no longer functional, we predicted that gill surface area would decrease. In the first experiment, K. marmoratus were exposed to either water (control) or air for 1 h, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 week followed by a return to water for 1 week (recovery). Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and light micrographs of gill sections were taken, and morphometric analyses of lamellar width, lamellar length and interlamellar cell mass (ILCM) height were performed. Following 1 week of air exposure, SEM indicated that there was a decrease in lamellar surface area. Morphometric analysis of light micrographs revealed that there were significant changes in the height of the ILCM, but there were no significant differences in lamellae width and length between any of the treatments. Following 1 week of recovery in water, the ILCM regressed and gill lamellae were similar to control fish, indicating that the morphological changes were reversible. In the second experiment, V̇CO2 was measured in fish continuously over a 5-day period in air and compared with previous measurements of oxygen uptake (V̇O2) in water. V̇CO2 varied between 6 and 10 $\mu$mol g-1 h -1 and was significantly higher on days 3, 4 and 5 relative to days 1 and 2. In contrast to V̇O2 in water, V̇CO2 in air showed no diurnal rhythm over a 24 h period. These findings indicate that K. marmoratus remodel their gill structures in response to air exposure and that these changes are completely reversible. Furthermore, over a similar time frame, changes in V̇CO2 indicate that metabolic rate is maintained at a rate comparable to that of fish in water, underlying the remarkable ability of K. marmoratus to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.},

abstract = {Softshell turtles overwinter in the same bodies of water as some emydids, but their reduced shell and increased non-pulmonary gas exchange may contribute to a different mechanism of overwintering. The dynamics of bimodal respiration, diving behaviour and blood acid-base status in Apalone ferox and Chrysemys picta were investigated under two different temperatures combined with three different aquatic PO2 levels. Both species obtained oxygen through pulmonary and non-pulmonary routes. Apalone ferox obtained more oxygen through non-pulmonary routes and increased its non-pulmonary V̇O2 in response to both higher aquatic PO2 and lower temperatures. Both species increased pulmonary V̇O2 in response to higher temperatures. As a consequence of the greater reliance of A. ferox on pulmonary V̇O2, warmer temperatures caused plasma PCO2 and [HCO3-] values to increase significantly compared with C. picta. Apalone ferox, which is efficient at bimodal respiration, displayed a high degree of plasticity with respect to both its respiratory and acid-base profiles, behaving more like an aquatic air-breathing fish in bimodal respiration at low temperature and more like a terrestrial air-breather at high temperature. Chrysemys picta, which is poor at bimodal respiration, was highly dependent on aerial gas exchange at both temperatures. Aquatic PO2 did not change any of the behavioural variables measured. At warm temperatures, A. ferox met O2 demands by increasing the rate of lung ventilation, which resulted in a significantly greater number of breathing bouts per hour and breaths per emersion period. However, the number of breaths per bout was not affected by temperature. As temperatures decreased, A. ferox utilized its non-pulmonary respiration ability and significantly increased its dive duration. Apalone ferox became less active at colder temperatures by significantly increasing the duration of inactive periods (from 4 to 18 min) and by significantly decreasing the frequency of activity bursts. Chrysemys picta also met the higher gas-exchange demands associated with increased temperature by increasing the rate of lung ventilation; however, this increase was not as large as that measured in A. ferox. Chrysemys picta displayed multiple rhythmic breaths per bout. These results indicate that, unlike aquatic PO2, temperature is an important factor in the regulation of diving and ventilatory behaviour in turtles. The species responded to temperature in dissimilar ways because of differences in their bimodal respiration ability.},

Hypoxia can slow development, kill embryos and induce premature hatching. For terrestrial eggs of red-eyed treefrogs, the embryonic period can extend ∼50% longer than development to hatching competence, and development is synchronous across perivitelline oxygen levels (PO2) ranging from 0.5-16.5 kPa. Embryos maintain large external gills until hatching, then gills regress rapidly. We assessed the respiratory value of external gills using gill manipulations and closed-system respirometry. Embryos without external gills were oxygen limited in air and hatched at an external PO2 of 17 kPa, whereas embryos with gills regulated their metabolism and remained in the egg at substantially lower PO2. By contrast, tadpoles gained no respiratory benefit from external gills. We videotaped behavior and manipulated embryos to test if they position gills near the air-exposed portion of the egg surface, where PO2 is highest. Active embryos remained stationary for minutes in gills-at-surface positions. After manipulations and spontaneous movements that positioned gills in the O2-poor region of the egg, however, they returned their gills to the air-exposed surface within seconds. Even neural tube stage embryos, capable only of ciliary rotation, positioned their developing head in the region of highest PO2. Such behavior may be critical both to delay hatching after hatching competence and to obtain sufficient oxygen for normal, synchronous development at earlier stages.},

We demonstrate that 30 min exposure to the 25-35 fragment of $\beta$AP do not markedly change the dynamics of synaptic responses in identified neurons of terrestrial snail while a significant decrease of long-term sensitization was observed after 180 min $\beta$AP bath application. In the behavioral experiments, a significant reduction of sensitization, and decreased ability to develop food-aversion conditioning was observed after $\beta$AP injection. Our results clearly demonstrate that the neurotoxic 25-35 fragment of $\beta$AP may play a significant role in behavioral plasticity by chronically eliminating certain underlying forms of synaptic plasticity.

We demonstrate that 30 min exposure to the 25-35 fragment of $\beta$AP do not markedly change the dynamics of synaptic responses in identified neurons of terrestrial snail while a significant decrease of long-term sensitization was observed after 180 min $\beta$AP bath application. In the behavioral experiments, a significant reduction of sensitization, and decreased ability to develop food-aversion conditioning was observed after $\beta$AP injection. Our results clearly demonstrate that the neurotoxic 25-35 fragment of $\beta$AP may play a significant role in behavioral plasticity by chronically eliminating certain underlying forms of synaptic plasticity. The study also proposes a novel invertebrate model to Alzheimer's disease. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: The reptiles, characterized by both diversity and unique evolutionary adaptations, provide a comprehensive system for comparative studies of metabolism, physiology, and development. However, molecular resources for ectothermic reptiles are severely limited, hampering our ability to study the genetic basis for many evolutionarily important traits such as metabolic plasticity, extreme longevity, limblessness, venom, and freeze tolerance. Here we use massively parallel sequencing (454 GS-FLX Titanium) to generate a transcriptome of the western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) with two goals in mind. First, we develop a molecular resource for an ectothermic reptile; and second, we use these sex-specific transcriptomes to identify differences in the presence of expressed transcripts and potential genes of evolutionary interest.Results: Using sex-specific pools of RNA (one pool for females, one pool for males) representing 7 tissue types and 35 diverse individuals, we produced 1.24 million sequence reads, which averaged 366 bp in length after cleaning. Assembly of the cleaned reads from both sexes with NEWBLER and MIRA resulted in 96,379 contigs containing 87% of the cleaned reads. Over 34% of these contigs and 13% of the singletons were annotated based on homology to previously identified proteins. From these homology assignments, additional clustering, and ORF predictions, we estimate that this transcriptome contains $\sim$13,000 unique genes that were previously identified in other species and over 66,000 transcripts from unidentified protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we use a graph-clustering method to identify contigs linked by NEWBLER-split reads that represent divergent alleles, gene duplications, and alternatively spliced transcripts. Beyond gene identification, we identified 95,295 SNPs and 31,651 INDELs. From these sex-specific transcriptomes, we identified 190 genes that were only present in the mRNA sequenced from one of the sexes (84 female-specific, 106 male-specific), and many highly variable genes of evolutionary interest.Conclusions: This is the first large-scale, multi-organ transcriptome for an ectothermic reptile. This resource provides the most comprehensive set of EST sequences available for an individual ectothermic reptile species, increasing the number of snake ESTs 50-fold. We have identified genes that appear to be under evolutionary selection and those that are sex-specific.

In adult animals, its expression is lower, but still observable in brain areas showing structural or functional plasticity. We examined patterns of GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the brain of the bullfrog, an animal whose nervous system undergoes considerable reorganization across metamorphic development and retains a strong capacity for plasticity in adulthood. Immunolabeling was mostly diffuse in hatchling tadpoles, but became progressively more discrete as larval development proceeded. In many brain areas, intensity of immunolabel peaked at metamorphic climax, the time of final transition from aquatic to semi-terrestrial life. Changes in intensity of GAP-43 expression in the medial vestibular nucleus, superior olivary nucleus, and torus semicircularis appeared correlated with stage-dependent functional changes in processing auditory stimuli. Immunolabeling in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and in the cerebellar nucleus was detectable at most developmental time points. Heavy immunolabel was present from early larval stages through the end of climax in the thalamus (ventromedial, anterior, posterior, central nuclei). Immunolabel in the tadpole telencephalon was observed around the lateral ventricles, and in the medial septum and ventral striatum. In postmetamorphic animals, immunoreactivity was confined mainly to the ventricular zones and immediately adjacent cell layers. GAP-43 expression was present in olfactory, auditory and optic cranial nerves throughout larval and postmetamorphic life. The continued expression of GAP-43 in brain nuclei and in cranial nerves throughout development and into adulthood reflects the high regenerative potential of the bullfrog's central nervous system.

abstract = {Investigation of gas exchange patterns and modulation of metabolism provide insight into metabolic control systems and evolution in diverse terrestrial environments. Variation in metabolic rate in response to environmental conditions has been explained largely in the context of two contrasting hypotheses, namely metabolic depression in response to stressful or resource(e.g. water) limited conditions, or elevation of metabolism at low temperatures to sustain life in extreme conditions. To deconstruct the basis for metabolic rate changes in response to temperature variation, here we undertake a full factorial study investigating the longer- and short-term effects of temperature exposure on gas exchange patterns. We examined responses of traits of gas exchange [standard metabolic rate (SMR); discontinuous gas exchange (DGE) cycle frequency; cuticular, respiratory and total water loss rate (WLR)] to elucidate the magnitude and form of plastic responses in the dung beetle, Scarabaeus spretus. Results showed that short- and longer-term temperature variation generally have significant effects on SMR and WLR. Overall, acclimation to increased temperature led to a decline in SMR (from 0.071 ±0.004 ml CO2 h-1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 0.039±0.004ml CO2h-1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 20°C) modulated by reduced DGE frequency (15°C acclimation: 0.554±0.027mHz, 20°C acclimation: 0.257±0.030mHz, 25°C acclimation: 0.208±0.027mHz recorded at 20°C), reduced cuticular WLRs (from 1.058±0.537mg h-1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 0.900±0.400 mg h-1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 20°C) and reduced total WLR (from 4.2±0.5mg h -1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 3.1 ±0.5 mg h -1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 25°C). Respiratory WLR was reduced from 2.25±0.40 mg h-1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 1.60±0.40 mg h-1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 25°C, suggesting conservation of water during DGE bursts. Overall, this suggests water conservation is a priority for S. spretus exposed to longer-term temperature variation, rather than elevation of SMR in response to low temperature acclimation, as might be expected from a beetle living in a relatively warm, low rainfall summer region. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of gas exchange patterns and trade-offs between metabolic rate and water balance in insects and other terrestrial arthropods. {\textcopyright} 2010.

Overall, acclimation to increased temperature led to a decline in SMR (from 0.071 ±0.004 ml CO2 h-1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 0.039±0.004ml CO2h-1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 20°C) modulated by reduced DGE frequency (15°C acclimation: 0.554±0.027mHz, 20°C acclimation: 0.257±0.030mHz, 25°C acclimation: 0.208±0.027mHz recorded at 20°C), reduced cuticular WLRs (from 1.058±0.537mg h-1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 0.900±0.400 mg h-1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 20°C) and reduced total WLR (from 4.2±0.5mg h -1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 3.1 ±0.5 mg h -1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 25°C). Respiratory WLR was reduced from 2.25±0.40 mg h-1 in 15°C-acclimated beetles to 1.60±0.40 mg h-1 in 25°C-acclimated beetles measured at 25°C, suggesting conservation of water during DGE bursts. Overall, this suggests water conservation is a priority for S. spretus exposed to longer-term temperature variation, rather than elevation of SMR in response to low temperature acclimation, as might be expected from a beetle living in a relatively warm, low rainfall summer region. These results are significant for understanding the evolution of gas exchange patterns and trade-offs between metabolic rate and water balance in insects and other terrestrial arthropods. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {Oxygen stress can slow development, induce hatching, and kill eggs. Terrestrial anamniote embryos face a potential conflict between oxygen uptake and water loss. We measured oxygen levels within eggs to characterize the respiratory environment for embryos of the red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, a Neotropical frog with arboreal egg masses and plastic hatching timing. Perivitelline oxygen partial pressure (Po2) was extremely variable both within and among eggs. Po2 increased with air-exposed surface of the egg and declined over the developmental period before hatching competence. Through the plastic hatching period, however, average Po2 was stable despite continued rapid development. Development was synchronous across a wide range of perivitelline Po2 (0.5-16.5 kPa), and hatching-competent embryos tolerated Po2 as low as 0.5 kPa without hatching. The variation in Po2 measured over short periods of time within individual eggs was as great as that measured across development or surface exposure, including sharp transients associated with embryo movements. There was also a strong gradient of Po2 across the egg from superficial to deep positions. Ciliary circulation of fluid within the egg is clearly insufficient to keep it mixed. Embryos may maintain development under hypoxic conditions by strategic positioning of respiratory surfaces, particularly external gills, to exploit the patchy distribution of oxygen within their eggs. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {With plastic rhizobox system, this paper studied the degradation behavior of methamidophos in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere of phaiozem and burozem planted with soybean. The results suggested that methamidophos could be rapidly decomposed in soil environment despite its higher acute toxicity, and its residual amount in phaiozem was generally below the level in burozem under same condition. In the absence of soybean (control), the residual amount of methamidophos at the 2nd day of incubation was about 33% in burozem, whereas only about 26% in phaiozem. An accelerated degradation of methamidophos in soybean rhizospheric soil was observed, especially in phaiozem. At the 9th day of incubation, the insecticide residue in the middle rhizobox phaiozem and burozem with soybean was decreased by 87.5% and 76.0%, respectively, compared with that of the control. The degradation process of methamidophos in soil environment followed the first-order equation, and its half-life was about 2 days.},

abstract = {Low phosphorus availability is a primary constraint for plant growth in terrestrial ecosystems. Lateral root initiation and elongation may play an important role in the uptake of immobile nutrients such as phosphorus by increasing soil exploration and phosphorus acquisition. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling lateral root length (LRL), number (LRN), and plasticity of the primary seedling root of maize under varying phosphorus availability. Using a cigar roll culture in a controlled environment, we evaluated primary root LRL and LRN at low and high phosphorus availability in 160 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between maize genotypes B73 and Mo17, which have contrasting adaptation to low phosphorus availability in the field. Low phosphorus availability increased LRL by 19% in Mo17, the phosphorus-efficient parent, but significantly decreased LRL in B73, the phosphorus-inefficient genotype. Substantial genetic variation and transgressive segregation for LRL and LRN existed in the population. The plasticity of LRL ranged from -100% to 146.3%, with a mean of 30.4%, and the plasticity of LRN ranged from -82.2% to 164.1%, with a mean of 18.5%. On the basis of composite interval mapping with a LOD threshold of 3.27, one QTL was associated with LRN plasticity, five QTLs were associated with LRL and one QTL was associated with LRN under high fertility. Under low fertility, six QTLs were associated with LRL and one QTL with LRN. No QTLs were detected for plasticity of LRL. A number of RILs exceeded Mo17, the phosphorus-efficient parent, for LRL, LRN, and plasticity. The detection of QTLs for these traits, in combination with the observation of transgressive segregants in our population, indicates that favorable alleles can be combined to increase seedling lateral root growth in maize. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},
